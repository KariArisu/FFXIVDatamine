As the first step in our ongoing efforts, we shall establish the Mendicant's Court as our base of operations. This area shall house facilities essential to the smooth and efficient operation of the project, and I humbly call upon your cooperation in laying the first stone in our great cause.

For your reference, the workflow's as follows:
1. Obtain material from supply pile
2. Process material at work station

Preparations are now underway to build facilities on the court's west, and for this we will of course require more supplies. I look forward to your continued contributions!

16,70305,"Dear friends of the Firmament,

As the base of operations for the reconstruction effort, the Mendicant's Court can be likened to a home to us. And a home, if nothing else, should be cheery and welcoming.

To that end, I propose that we improve the ambience of the court by refurbishing the skybuilders' board and lighting the braziers. A worthwhile cause, I hope you will agree, and help me to make it possible by contributing the necessary supplies.

Lizbeth",""

Braziers:
1. Obtain material from supply pile
2. Process material into firewood at work station
3. Feed firewood to brazier
Skybuilders' board:
1. Obtain material from supply pile
2. Process material at work station
3. Assemble material at assembly site

Nothing complicated. Let's all rally behind Lizbeth, eh?

18,70307,"I am pleased to announce the completion of all works in the Mendicant's Court. This brings us to a brief hiatus as plans are finalized for the next phase, but you may as ever contribute to the cause by donating supplies.

This is a momentous malmstone in our efforts, and we may rightly be proud for having reached it. But let none be mistaken: we still have a mountain to climb. The complete reconstruction of the Firmament will still take a tremendous amount of time and effort. Nonetheless, I am determined as ever to see that this district one day brims with smiles and happiness, and it is my hope that I can rely on your ongoing cooperation.

In order to ensure a high level of participation, works are announced ahead of time on the builders' board.

Due to the specialized nature of these works, they can only be undertaken by crafters and gatherers. The specifics of upcoming works may be reviewed on this board.

Participants will earn skybuilders' scrips as a reward.",""

Willing and able hands are sought to contribute to the reconstruction effort, regardless of birth and origin. Foreign experts will primarily be tasked with technical oversight along with the preparation and procurement of supplies.

Contributions are rewarded by way of skybuilders' scrips, which may be exchanged in the district for myriad wares. For more information, please seek out Enie.

All participants are urged to refer to this notice board often for project news such as pending works.

We thank you for your part in rebuilding our great nation.",""
