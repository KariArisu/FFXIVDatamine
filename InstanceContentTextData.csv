10700,"So for this exercise, ye'll be learnin' about “enmity” an' how to build it."
10701,"Enmity is a measure o' how badly a foe wants to kill ye, an' it's yer job to be at the top of every enemy's list."
10702,"The best way to establish yerself as a threat?
String together some nasty combinations!"
10703,"In yer case, I'd start out with a Fast Blade, an' follow it up with a Savage Blade!"
10704,"In yer case, I'd start out with a Heavy Swing, an' follow it up with a Skull Sunder!"
10705,"In yer case, I'd start out with a Hard Slash, an' follow it up with a Spinning Slash!"
10706,"Show me a solid series of blows, an' I'll consider yer lesson learned."

Fast Blade first! Savage Blade second!"

Heavy Swing first! Skull Sunder second!"
10709,"Remember the order I told ye, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>!
Hard Slash first! Spinning Slash second!"
10710,"Use the combo advised by the master to attack the striking dummy!"
10711,"Hit that wooden warrior with yer combination!
Fast Blade first! Savage Blade second!"
10712,"Hit that wooden warrior with yer combination!
Heavy Swing first! Skull Sunder second!"
10713,"Hit that wooden warrior with yer combination!
Hard Slash first! Spinning Slash second!"
10714,"Don't try nothin' fancy! Get the order wrong more'n four times an' we start over! "
10715,"When it comes to yer place in a party, yer the wall o' steel what takes the enemy hits."
10716,"Soakin' up the pain, an' keepin' yer mates safe─that's what ye need to focus on most durin' battle."
10717,"The best way to establish yerself as a threat?
String together some nasty combinations!"
10718,"The best way to establish yerself as a threat?
String together some nasty combinations!"
10800,"Do ye recall how ye built enmity in the last exercise? This time ye'll be testin' that combination on a proper opponent."
10801,"I've said this before, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>, but it bears repeatin': yer job is to soak up the pain, an' keep yer mates safe."
10802,"An' ye do that by directin' the foe's enmity onto yerself."
10803,"If yer ally's still standin' at the end o' the fight, I'll count that as a win!"
10804,"Defeat the axe-wielding training partner!"
10805,"Pound yer opponent with yer combination!
Don't let yer ally get hit!"
10806,"Yer ally's gettin' slaughtered!
Drag the foe's attention onto yerself!"
10900,"For this exercise, ye'll learn to establish enmity with a ranged attack."
10901,"...An' yer Shield Lob technique'll be the tool for the job."
10902,"...An' yer Tomahawk technique'll be the tool for the job."
10903,"...An' yer Unmend technique'll be the tool for the job."
10904,"Rather than blunder into a mob o' nasties, yer better off pullin' a few at a time from a safe distance!"
10905,"Use Shield Lob to break a chunk away from the group, then grab their full attention with Flash once they reach ye!"
10906,"Don't get too close! Ye don't want to fight 'em all at once!"
10907,"Establish enmity with ranged attacks, and defeat all enemies!"
10908,"Use Tomahawk to break a chunk away from the group, then grab their full attention with Overpower once they reach ye!"
10909,"Use Unmend to break a chunk away from the group, then grab their full attention with Unleash once they reach ye!"
10910,"That's it! Divide and conquer, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>!"
10911,"The rest o' the mob has seen ye!
Yer work's cut out for ye now!"
10912,"In battle, yer enemies won't care naught for “fair.” Stroll into a pack o' foes, an' yer askin' to get swarmed!"
10913,"Defeat every enemy on the field, an' I'll consider yer lesson learned."
11000,"For this exercise, ye'll learn how to build enmity with multiple foes."
11001,"Have ye ever tried usin' the Flash technique? It'll let ye aggravate an entire group of enemies!"
11002,"Flash hits every bugger within a circle around ye─make sure yer positioned so ye don't miss anyone!"
11003,"Have ye ever tried usin' the Overpower technique? It'll let ye aggravate an entire group of enemies!"
11004,"Overpower hits every bugger in a cone in front of ye─make sure yer positioned so ye don't miss anyone!"
11005,"Have ye ever tried usin' the Unleash technique? It'll let ye aggravate an entire group of enemies!"
11006,"Unleash hits every bugger within a circle around ye─make sure yer positioned so ye don't miss anyone!"
11007,"Did ye not hear me, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>!?
Use Flash to hit all three dummies AT THE SAME TIME!"
11008,"Did ye not hear me, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>!?
Use Overpower to hit all three dummies AT THE SAME TIME!"
11009,"Did ye not hear me, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>!?
Use Unleash to hit all three dummies AT THE SAME TIME!"
11010,"Build enmity with all three striking dummies simultaneously!"
11011,"Use yer Flash technique to hit all three dummies at once!"
11012,"Use yer Overpower technique to hit all three dummies at once!"
11013,"Use yer Unleash technique to hit all three dummies at once!"
11014,"If ye fail to carry out me instructions five times, ye'll be startin' the exercise over!"
11100,"For this exercise, ye'll be trainin' against multiple opponents."
11101,"Use Flash to gain enmity with a group, just like ye practiced. Be sure that the enemy's only interested in hittin' <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>!"
11102,"Use Overpower to gain enmity with a group, just like ye practiced. Be sure that the enemy's only interested in hittin' <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>!"
11103,"Use Unleash to gain enmity with a group, just like ye practiced. Be sure that the enemy's only interested in hittin' <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>!"
11104,"Yer ally's gettin' murdered!
Drag the enemy's attention onto yerself!"
11105,"Fight while building enmity with multiple opponents!"
11106,"Adjust yer position so that ye hit all yer foes with Flash!"
11107,"Adjust yer position so that ye hit all yer foes with Overpower!"
11108,"Adjust yer position so that ye hit all yer foes with Unleash!"
11109,"Once ye've got the situation under control, ye can start usin' combinations!"
11110,"Defeat every enemy on the field, an' I'll consider yer lesson learned."
11200,"For this exercise, ye'll learn to deal with reinforcements."
11201,"Sometimes there're latecomers to a battle, so ye've got to stay alert."
11202,"If ye notice a new foe arrive, don't give in to panic! Keep calm, an' pick the enemy up with yer usual tools!"
11203,"Yer ally is takin' a beatin'!
Do what it takes to make the enemy notice ye!"
11204,"Defeat the enemy while staying alert for reinforcements!"
11205,"The axeman will call for aid at certain points in the battle! Prioritize takin' down the reinforcements!"
11206,"Move yerself─and the fight─some distance away! Ye don't want yer ally gettin' hit by them big swings!"
11207,"There's a new enemy on the field!
Use Shield Lob if ye have to!"
11208,"Nice work! Now take down that newcomer!"
11209,"Are they too far away for a combination?
Then reel 'em in with a Shield Lob!"
11210,"Are they too far away for a combination?
Then reel 'em in with a Tomahawk!"
11211,"Are they too far away for a combination?
Then reel 'em in with an Unmend!"
11212,"Once ye've got everyone nice an' close, ye can switch to Flash to keep that enmity flowin'!"
11213,"Once ye've got everyone nice an' close, ye can switch to Overpower to keep that enmity flowin'!"
11214,"Once ye've got everyone nice an' close, ye can switch to Unleash to keep that enmity flowin'!"
11215,"There's a new enemy on the field!
Use Tomahawk if ye have to!"
11216,"There's a new enemy on the field!
Use Unmend if ye have to!"
11217,"Defeat every enemy on the field, an' I'll consider yer lesson learned."
11300,"As you might have guessed, the purpose of this exercise is to teach cooperation."
11301,"Your ally will hold the enemy's attention─it is your job to take the foe down!"
11302,"味方と協力して、敵を討伐できれば訓練合格だよ！"
11303,"Defeat the axe-wielding training partner!"
11304,"Attack the same foe as your ally to win the battle!"
11305,"That's the way, novice! I'll keep him occupied─you concentrate on bringing him down!"
11306,"Very good!
Now here's a hint about enemy facing!"
11307,"Your opponent will have a harder time avoiding blows from the flanks or from behind."
11308,"There are also certain techniques that perform better when executed from such positions."
11309,"When it comes to your place in a party you are the sharp end of the spear."
11310,"Simply put, your role is to inflict as much damage as possible, while keeping your own skin intact."
11311,"As such, you cannot just attack whichever enemy you please!"
11312,"If you strike a foe other than one controlled by your ally, then you risk becoming the target of deadly aggression."
11313,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11400,"For this exercise, you will be fighting multiple opponents!"
11401,"The key to victory is coordination with your comrades─each foe will fall all the swifter under a focused assault!"
11402,"Pay attention, novice!
Target the enemy engaged by your ally!"
11403,"Coordinate with your allies and defeat the enemy!"
11404,"Mark well the opponent your ally has engaged, and attack the same enemy!"
11405,"Start the fight with the staff waver─such foes are often the most dangerous, but the least robust."
11406,"Be sure to attack the same enemy as your ally! Strike the wrong foe five times and you fail this exercise!"
11407,"That's the way, novice! Once this one's down, we'll move on to the fistfighter!"
11408,"There's another yet standing!
Don't lose your focus!"
11409,"He's almost done for!
Grind him into the dust!"
11410,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11500,"Do you remember the lesson where I had you evading enemy attacks?"
11501,"This exercise will put that training to the test. You must needs plan your strikes around some fancy footwork!"
11502,"You must pay attention! Watch for the signs whilst you press the attack!"
11503,"Engage the axe wielder, but keep an eye out for counterattacks!"
11504,"Defeat the enemy while avoiding attacks!"
11505,"If you allow yourself to be hit five times, we will start this exercise again from the beginning!"
11506,"Well done! Slippery as an eel, novice!"
11507,"Not bad, aye...
Care to dodge this!?"
11508,"Victory is within reach!
Be on your guard until the very last!"
11509,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11600,"This exercise will teach you how to deal with enemy reinforcements."
11601,"As the battle progresses, new foes will appear on the field."
11602,"These sudden arrivals will target your weakest comrade, so you must be quick to eliminate them!"
11603,"Your healer is under attack!
Swiftly now! Eliminate the aggressor! "
11604,"Another enemy has arrived on the field!
Engage this new foe!"
11605,"Keep an eye peeled for reinforcements, novice!"
11606,"Defeat the enemy while staying alert for reinforcements!"
11607,"Excellent!
You handled the situation perfectly!"
11608,"Here comes another!
Make short work of this skirmisher!"
11609,"Very good! Now see the battle to its end!"
11610,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11700,"In this exercise, you will learn to manipulate the battlefield."
11701,"During the battle, enemies will pour forth from the rear gate. New foes will continue to flood in whilst this portal remains open."
11702,"You must operate the lever that closes the gate, or your party will be overwhelmed!"
11703,"The reinforcements are without end!
Quickly─use the lever to close the gate!"
11704,"Manipulate the battlefield and defeat the enemy!"
11705,"Engage the enemy, but be wary of the gate!"
11706,"The gate has opened! Ignore the reinforcements for now, and operate the lever!"
11707,"Well done! The flood of enemies has ceased! Now mop up the foes remaining!"
11708,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11800,"Now that you understand what is expected of you, we can continue with the lesson."
11801,"The upcoming exercise requires that you keep your ally healed."
11802,"When it comes to your place in a party you are the soothing wind of restoration."
11803,"When you've healed all there is to heal, there may be time to weave in some offensive magicks."
11804,"Heal your ally and defeat the axe-wielding training partner!"
11805,"Your primary concern should be healing your ally!"
11806,"But keep an eye on your companion!
You should not be blasting if someone is bleeding!"
11807,"As such, rather than engaging the enemy directly, your primary role is to focus upon the mending of wounds."
11808,"With the support of your diligent healing, your party will prevail against even the most savage of foes! "
11809,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
11900,"In this next exercise, you will be healing multiple allies."
11901,"You will need to stay alert, and switch your attention between allies as the situation demands."
11902,"体力の少ない味方がいます！　急いで回復を！"
11903,"There's a new enemy on the field! You'll need to keep an eye on the health of both allies!"
11904,"Maintain the health of your allies and defeat the enemy!"
11905,"Focus your attention on the well-being of your companions!"
11906,"Another enemy threatens your party! You might try attacking this foe if your allies are uninjured."
11907,"Battle is chaotic, and you must needs learn flexibility."
11908,"Thus, you will find yourself in a scenario in which sudden reinforcements threaten your party."
11909,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
12000,"For this exercise, you will learn to heal whilst avoiding harm."
12001,"As before, you must watch for signs you are being attacked. Move swiftly, and time your casts to avoid interruption."
12002,"If you are hit five times, we shall start again from the beginning!"
12003,"Pay attention, now!
Dead healers cast no cures!"
12004,"Well done! Slippery as an eel, novice!"
12005,"Not bad, aye...
Care to dodge this!?"
12006,"Stand clear of your companions! An attack that targets you need not threaten them as well!"
12007,"Victory is within reach!
Be on your guard until the very last!"
12008,"Defeat the enemy while healing allies and avoiding attacks!"
12009,"Avoid enemy attacks, and heal your allies!"
12010,"Success will be a matter of combining lessons already learned!"
12011,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
12100,"This is it! The final exercise!"
12101,"As the culmination of yer trainin', all the skills ye've learned'll be put to the test!"
12102,"You've arrived at the mountain's peak─the final exercise!"
12103,"As the culmination of your training, all the skills you've acquired will be put to the test!"
12104,"And now we come to the final exercise..."
12105,"As the culmination of your training, all the skills you've acquired will be put to the test."
12106,"Right, let's start with the basics! Keep the foe away from yer allies, an' watch yer positionin'!"
12107,"Let's begin with the basics, shall we? Pay attention to the enemy's facing, and stay out of harm's way!"
12108,"As always, healing is your primary concern!
Attack only when it is safe to do so!"
12109,"Ye've got more company!
Establish yerself as the biggest threat!"
12110,"Watch out for the jackal!
Put it down quickly!"
12111,"Watch out for the jackal!
Be sure your ally does not fall to its jaws!"
12112,"More reinforcements!
Take control o' the field! Show 'em who's in charge!"
12113,"Another jackal!
Spare your healer its jaws!"
12114,"Another jackal!
Keep an eye on your lightly armored companion!"
12115,"Ye've handled groups in yer previous trainin'! This's no different!"
12116,"Now you face multiple foes! Remember to coordinate efforts with your allies!"
12117,"Now the battle becomes interesting...
You'll need to watch your positioning here."
12118,"Defeat the tamed dodo"
12119,"Defeat the tamed jackals"
12120,"Defeat the tamed puks"
12121,"Defeat the tamed goobbue"
12122,"Yer near the end of it now, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>, but stay focused! This bloke's a bit of a handful..."
12123,"And now for the last challenge!
This one hits hard, so be quick on your feet!"
12124,"Your last opponent looms!
This one packs a wallop, so stay on your toes!"
12125,"Just one more push! Victory is yers for the takin'!"
12126,"Just a little more, novice!
Keep your focus, and see this foe defeated!"
12127,"The end is in sight!
Be sure your allies survive the battle!"
12128,"Breathe deep, remember yer lessons, an' ye'll do fine! Let me know when yer ready to begin."
12129,"Put your lessons into practice and you'll do just fine! Say the word when you are ready to begin."
12130,"Put your lessons into practice and you'll do just fine! We can begin as soon as you are ready."
12200,"Listen up, novice!"
12201,"Are we clear?
Let me know when yer ready to begin."
12202,"This trainin' exercise is now underway!"
12203,"...Ye've failed this one, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. Let's chalk it up to experience, an' try again, eh?"
12204,"...I'm callin' an end to this exercise. Let's chalk it up to experience, an' try again, eh?"
12205,"An' this concludes the exercise!
Come see me for yer reward."
12206,"That's the way!"
12207,"Defeat every enemy on the field, an' I'll consider yer lesson learned."
12208,"Let us proceed directly to the briefing."
12209,"Everything is clear, I trust? Say the word when you are ready to begin."
12210,"This training exercise is now underway!"
12211,"I'm afraid you've failed this one, novice...
But, chin up! Practice makes perfect!"
12212,"I'm afraid I must call an end to this exercise...
But, chin up! Practice makes perfect!"
12213,"Bravo! And thus concludes the exercise.
Pray come and receive your reward."

12215,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
12216,"Do I have your full attention?
Then let us proceed."

We can begin as soon as you are ready."

But you begin again knowing what to expect!"
