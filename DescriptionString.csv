29,Doman Mahjong for Beginners
30,1. Introduction
31,Doman mahjong is a game for four players. The following guide covers the basic rules.
32,2. What is Doman Mahjong?
33,In Doman mahjong, players <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>race to complete a winning hand of 14 tiles, with points awarded for speed and difficulty of the hand<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.
Players begin with 13 tiles and draw a new tile each turn. They must then choose a tile to discard: either the new tile or one of the tiles in their hand. The player to the right then takes a turn, and the process is repeated until the end of the hand.

The first player to complete a winning hand is awarded points. A total of eight hands are played, and the player who finishes with the most points is declared the winner.
Here is an example of a winning hand:
34,The 14 tiles form <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>four groups of three tiles and one pair of matching tiles<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>. A group of tiles is known as a “meld,” and the various types are explained in this guide. The combination of melds determines the difficulty of the hand and the points awarded when winning.


35,3. The Tiles
36,Mahjong tiles are divided into “number tiles” and “honor tiles.”

■ Number Tiles
There are three suits of number tiles, each ranging from 1 to 9.

37,■ Honor Tiles
There are two suits of honor tiles: the four wind tiles and the three dragon tiles. Unlike number tiles, they appear in no particular sequence, and therefore cannot be used to form straights. They can only form melds with identical tiles.
38,There are 34 varieties of tile, with four of each for a total of 136.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Players aim to form a winning hand of 14 tiles before the other players and earn as many points as possible.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

39,4. Forming Melds
40,■ Straights
Number tiles may form straights such as 2, 3, 4 or 4, 5, 6, provided the tiles are all in the same suit. However, sequences such as 8, 9, 1 or 9, 1, 2 are not permitted.
41,■ Triplets
Number tiles and honor tiles can also form matching triplets with identical tiles.
42,A winning hand consists of 14 tiles and requires four melds and one matching pair.

※There are special combinations that ignore this particular rule, but beginners should focus on learning the basic hands first.


43,5. Order of Play
44,Each of the four players begins with 13 tiles, and the dealer─who is chosen automatically─plays first.
That player draws one new tile and chooses one tile to discard. This may either be the new tile or one from their hand.
Once that player has discarded a tile, the player to the right takes a turn. This process is repeated until the end of the hand.
45,The hand ends when a player calls a winning hand. The hand also ends if all of the tiles are drawn with no player calling a winning hand.
46,At the start of a new hand, the role of dealer passes to the player on the right. A round consists of eight hands, during which time the role of dealer passes around the board twice. The player with the highest score at the end of the round is declared the winner.


47,6. Points for a Winning Hand
48,Each player begins the game with 25,000 points, which increase when calling a winning hand. However, points may be deducted when another player calls a winning hand.

A winning hand can be formed in one of two ways:

49,1. Tsumo: When a tile is drawn
When a winning hand is formed with a tile drawn by the player, the point value is calculated, and each of the other three players pays this point cost.
If the dealer calls a winning hand, the point value is increased by 50%.
If the dealer has to pay another player, they must pay double.
50,2. Ron: When another player discards a tile
If a player discards a tile that allows another player to form a winning hand, only the player that discarded the tile must pay.
When the dealer forms a winning hand in this manner, the point value is increased by 50%. However, if the dealer is the player who discarded the tile, only the standard amount is paid.
51,The dealer has the advantage of earning 50% more points from a winning hand.
In addition, when a dealer calls the winning hand, the <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>role of dealer does not pass to the next player<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, thus giving the dealer an opportunity to score even more points.
52,7. Yaku, Required for a Winning Hand
53,As mahjong revolves around scoring as many points as possible, it is important to know the difference between low-scoring and high-scoring hands.
54,The value of a hand is determined by “yaku”─specific combinations of melds. The value of each yaku is measured in “han,” with 6 han being the highest and 1 han the lowest. The harder the yaku is to form, the more han it is worth.
55,The han value of the hand is used to calculate the number of points awarded.
Points are awarded as follows:
56,　1 Han     1,000 Points
　2 Han     2,000 Points
　3 Han     3,900 Points

　4 Han     8,000 Points
　5 Han     8,000 Points

　6 Han     12,000 Points
　7 Han     12,000 Points

　8 Han　 16,000 Points
　9 Han　 16,000 Points
　10 Han   16,000 Points

　11 Han    24,000 Points
　12 Han    24,000 Points

　13 Han and higher     32,000 Points
57,In certain situations, further calculations are involved which may lead to point increases.
58,As yaku are used to calculate the points earned, <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>a winning hand must contain at least one yaku<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.
Although a winning hand normally requires four melds and a matching pair, this alone does not constitute a winning hand.


59,8. Basic Yaku
60,There are many types of yaku, but we recommend learning these basic yaku first:
61,■ Tanyao
Only number tiles from 2 to 8 are used.
The hand cannot contain any honor tiles or tiles numbered 1 or 9.
62,■ All Pon
Four matching triplets and a matching double.
63,■ Pure Straight
Contains numbers 1 to 9 of the same suit. Presented as three triplets of 1, 2, 3, then 4, 5, 6, and 7, 8, 9.
64,■ Mixed Triple Chi
The same straight, for example, 1, 2, 3, in each suit.
65,■ Half Flush
Number tiles from a single suit plus honor tiles.
66,■ Full Flush
Only number tiles from one suit.
67,Please refer to the Lodestone for a full list of yaku and other useful information.


68,9. Riichi Yaku
69,A special condition known as “riichi” makes it easier to form a yaku.
70,The hand in the diagram only requires a 3 or a 6 of Dots to form a winning hand.
When a player is one tile away from a winning hand, riichi may be declared.
71,When the hand is ready for declaring riichi, the player will have the option to do so before discarding a tile. In the case shown in the diagram, if the declaring player receives a 3 or a 6 of Dots, whether the tile is drawn by the player or discarded by another player, a winning hand can be called.
After declaring riichi, that player can no longer put drawn tiles into their hand. Any tiles drawn will automatically be discarded until a tile that completes the winning hand is obtained. However, a winning hand achieved through riichi is a yaku in itself. Therefore, the player does not need to have formed any other yaku to complete a winning hand.
72,■ Properties of Riichi
　1.　The player's hand automatically becomes a yaku, regardless of whether it contains any other yaku.
　2.　The other players know that the one declaring riichi is one tile away from a winning hand.
　3.　The declaring player cannot replace any of the tiles in their hand.
　4.　The declaring player must pay 1,000 points─indicated with a point stick placed in the center of the table─which go to the winner of the hand.


73,10. Yaku Tiles
74,The honor tiles offer another method for forming a yaku.
75,A triplet of any of these three tiles forms a yaku.
76,The wind tiles can be used to form a yaku in a similar fashion, although certain conditions apply.
77,■ Round-specific Conditions
A game of Doman mahjong is divided into eight hands. The first round, in which the role of dealer passes to each player once, is called “East.” A triplet of east wind tiles forms a yaku in this round. The second round, “South,” allows a yaku to be formed with a triplet of south wind tiles.
78,■ Seat-specific Conditions
Each player is assigned a “seat wind” according to their seating position in relation to the dealer.

　Dealer = East
　Dealer's right = South
　Opposite the dealer = West
　Dealer's left = North

The seat wind for each player changes counterclockwise in this order: East, South, West, North. (This layout differs from the standard compass directions.) A triplet of wind tiles with the current seat wind forms a yaku.
The seat wind rotates together with the role of dealer, and players have a chance to easily form a yaku by paying attention to their seat wind marker.
79,11. Pon and Chi
80,It is difficult to form a winning hand relying solely on drawn tiles. However, tiles discarded by other players can be claimed by using “pon” and “chi.”
81,■ Pon
If you have a pair of matching tiles, when another player discards a tile that can be used to form a triplet, you may call pon to claim the tile.
82,■ Chi
Calling chi allows you to claim a number tile discarded by another player and complete a straight. However, it can only be called for the player whose turn comes before yours.
83,Although pon and chi allow you to form a winning hand more quickly, there are some drawbacks.
84,■ Drawback 1: Revealing Your Hand
Using pon or chi to form a triplet or straight will cause it to be revealed to the other players. In addition, you can no longer use those tiles for any other melds.
This can lead to missing opportunities to form better hands as a result of having those tiles locked into a triplet or straight.
85,■ Drawback 2: Preventing Riichi
It is not possible to declare riichi after using pon or chi.
Due to being unable to form a riichi yaku, you must find a way to form a different yaku. There are also certain yaku that can only be formed on the condition that you have not used pon or chi, so these will also become unavailable. In some cases, pon and chi will limit your ability to score points.
86,12. Dora Bonuses
87,In each hand, certain tiles are selected as “dora” and will grant bonus han simply for being included in a winning hand. While dora apply han bonuses, they are not in themselves yaku, so a yaku must be formed in order to take advantage of dora.
88,■ Dora
A dora tile is randomly selected at the start of each hand and is displayed throughout.
89,■ Aka Dora
Each suit contains four number 5 tiles. One of these four is colored red, and is known as the “aka dora.” Simply including an aka dora adds one bonus han to a winning hand. There are three aka dora in total, one for each suit.
90,■ Ura Dora
When calling a winning hand after declaring riichi, the “ura dora” is revealed. This is only shown after the winning hand has been called and is nothing more than a surprise bonus, although it provides added incentive to try declaring riichi.


91,13. Kan
92,Since there are four of each tile, it is possible to collect all four. This is known as “kan.”
93,Although kan is not in itself a yaku, it awards additional bonuses when calculating the points earned by a winning hand. Kan also increases the number of dora, which may offer further advantages.
Similarly to pon and chi, calling kan locks those tiles, preventing them from being replaced or used in other melds.
94,14. Learn by Playing
95,Doman mahjong is a complex game even once you have learned all of the rules. However, many of the actions normally carried out by players themselves are performed automatically, so feel free to head to the tables and try your luck without worrying about the less important details. Why not start at the novices' table?

Once you have a grasp of the basics, you may wish to challenge other adventurers via the Duty Finder.
For details on the more advanced rules, please refer to the guide on the Lodestone.
96,Playing Mahjong
97,NPC Matches
98,The Gold Saucer offers games against novice, intermediate, and advanced opponents.
99,It is also possible to challenge these opponents while waiting for a party in the Duty Finder. However, the game will be abandoned if the Duty Finder matches you with a party and you choose to enter the duty.
100,Player Matches
101,You may challenge other players to matches via the Gold Saucer tab in the Duty Finder.

■ Novice Mahjong (Ranked)
This match type is immediately available. After registering as a solo player, you will be matched against other players.
Your performance will affect your rating.
　1st: +30 points　2nd: +15 points　3rd: No change
　4th: 2nd kyu or higher, -10 points
The higher your rank, the more points are lost when finishing 4th.

■ Advanced Mahjong (Ranked)
Only players ranked 1st dan or higher can register. After registering as a solo player, you will be matched against other players.
Ratings are affected as follows:
　1st: +60 points　2nd: +15 points　3rd: No change

The higher your rank, the more points are lost when finishing 4th.

■ Four-player Mahjong (Kuitan enabled)
You must form a party of four players to begin the match. Ratings and ranks are not affected.
※<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>The kuitan rule allows tanyao yaku to be used after calling pon or chi.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

■ Four-player Mahjong (Kuitan disabled)
You must form a party of four players to begin the match. Ratings and ranks are not affected.
※<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Playing with kuitan disabled prevents tanyao yaku from being used after calling pon or chi.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>


102,■ Rules
・Each player has a certain amount of time to take their turn. A tile will be discarded automatically if that player fails to act within the time limit. This time limit does not apply to four-player mahjong (kuitan enabled/disabled).
・A time limit applies to the period between hands. In addition, if a single hand lasts more than 80 minutes, the following hand will be the last one played. Once that hand ends, the game ends, final placements are decided, and the results are recorded.
・Each game has a time limit of 120 minutes, after which the game will end automatically. Results will not be recorded.

103,■ Chat
・During a four-player mahjong game, you may chat to the other players.
・Chat can be toggled on and off using the button in the lower right of the screen. Turning chat off will prevent you from sending and receiving messages. On-screen icons indicate whether the other players are participating in the chat.

104,■ Rating and Rank
・Matches played in “Novice Mahjong (Ranked)” and “Advanced Mahjong (Ranked)” will affect your rating and rank.
・Your rating starts at 1,500, and will increase or decrease according to your finishing position in each match.
・Although you cannot be demoted while in the lower ranks, progressing to the higher ranks puts you at risk of demotion should you perform poorly.
・Ratings and ranks are calculated only according to the rating of your opponents and your finishing position in the game.
(The number of points with which you end a game is not taken into consideration.)
・Your mahjong rating and rank can be viewed in the Gold Saucer menu, under Mahjong.

105,■ Abandoning a Match
・If players log out during a mahjong match, tiles will be discarded automatically when their turn comes around. When players log back in, they will regain control from the next hand onwards.
・If players abandon a match, it will continue without them and their tiles will be discarded automatically. They will also incur the standard penalties for abandoning a duty and will be unable to register for another mahjong match until the previous match ends.
・If players do not enter any commands for a certain amount of time, they will be automatically removed from the match.


106,Navigating the Screen
107,Understanding the UI
108,1. Shows the 13 tiles in your hand. When you draw a tile, it is shown as the 14th tile, to the right of your hand. When your turn comes, select a tile to discard it.
109,2. When you are in a position to call riichi, tsumo, ron, pon, chi, or kan, a prompt will appear. In the case of pon, chi, and kan, this prompt can be hidden.
To hide these prompts, set Display Calls to Off. However, this option defaults to On at the start of a new hand.

If you turn on “Auto-declare winning hand,” you will automatically declare a winning hand as soon as tsumo or ron become available. This option defaults to Off at the start of a new hand.

110,3. The star icon indicates which player is the dealer. It is also displayed in the center of the table.
The compass direction shown below each player's name is their current seat wind. Players can form a yaku by collecting three wind tiles that match their seat wind. The role of dealer rotates counterclockwise, from east, to south, to west, to north.


111,4. A game of Doman mahjong is played over eight hands. The first four are the “East” round and the last four are the “South” round. Collecting three wind tiles that match the current round forms a yaku.


112,5. These sticks indicate any points carried over in the event of a draw. If a player declares riichi, the 1,000 points they pay are also shown here. When a player wins a hand, these points are added to their score. A stick with several black dots is worth 100 points and a stick with a single red dot is worth 1,000 points.
Every time a hand is replayed, a special bonus known as “honba” increases by one, also indicated here. When a player produces a winning hand, they will receive an additional 300 points for each honba.


113,6. Indicates the dora for the current hand. If a player includes a tile identical to the dora in a winning hand, they will receive bonus han, which increases points earned.
114,7. Buttons for toggling the various settings. For more information, see Support Features in the Playing Mahjong section.


115,Support Features
116,■ Dangerous Tile Marker
When discarding a tile, there is always a risk that an opponent may claim that tile to strengthen their position or even win the hand. These markers indicate which tiles carry a high risk of being claimed by an opponent.
Remember, even the tiles without markers are not entirely without risk, but enabling this feature may help you to avoid defeat.
117,The most dangerous tiles will have this kind of marker.
118,You should also be wary of tiles with these markers.
119,■ Hints
Enable this feature for recommendations on which tiles to discard, whether to call pon or chi, and so on. While following this advice will not always lead to victory, you may find it useful.


120,
121,Rival Wings
122,Overview
123,Rival Wings is a large-scale PvP battle involving up to 48 combatants. Participants are divided into two teams, the Falcons and the Ravens.
Each team may pilot powerful machina as they attempt to destroy the opponent's core, which is defended by mammets.
124,■Basic Rules
A Rival Wings team consists of 6 light parties, for a total of 24 participants.
A match lasts for 20 minutes.

■Retaliation
Incapacitated players will be returned to their landing point, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. Furthermore, players will be invulnerable so long as they remain at their landing point. This effect will be lost upon returning to the battlefield.

■Mounts
Players are free to use mounts during Rival Wings campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be afflicted with the Limp status effect.

■Return 
Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Rival Wings campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

■Rewards
When a match has ended, players will receive PvP EXP, PvE EXP, Wolf Marks, and Allagan tomestones.
By continually winning Rival Wings matches, players will receive achievements that reward special mounts and gear.
125,Cores and Towers
126,The first team to destroy the core located on the opponent's base will be declared the winner. In the event neither team destroys a core, the team that deals the most damage to the opponent's core wins. If both teams have dealt the same amount of damage to each other's cores, the number of remaining towers─which protect the core─determines victory. Should the number of remaining towers be the same for both teams, the amount of damage dealt to the towers determines the winners.
127,■Cores
Each team has a core located at its base, and the chief objective is to destroy the enemy's core. The core is protected by a magitek field emanating from two towers, so before you can strike at the core, you must first destroy at least one of the towers.
128,■Towers
Each team has two towers that serve to protect their core. Each tower is also enveloped in a defensive field that mitigates damage taken by team members and restores their HP, which players can take advantage of as protection when hard-pressed by the opposing team. If you succeed in destroying the enemy team's towers, the magitek fields around both teams' bases will dissipate, and your team will earn Soaring stacks.
129,■Magitek Fields
Each team has two towers which project a magitek field to guard the core. While both towers are present, the core cannot be damaged, and the field deals severe damage over time to any enemies that enter.
If one of the towers is destroyed, the defensive effect of the magitek field is weakened, allowing damage to be dealt to the core. In addition, the magitek field will no longer deal damage to enemies.
When both towers are destroyed, the magitek field disappears and the core will receive full damage from enemy attacks.
130,Machina
131,Players can deploy three types of powerful machina in battle.
132,■Cruise Chaser
A next-generation machina ideal for combat against enemy players and machina. While it possesses a high degree of mobility, it lacks in durability.
133,■Oppressor 
A hulking machina engineered for siege warfare, it excels at wreaking havoc upon structures. However, it is slow and poorly suited to combating enemy players and machina.
134,■Brute Justice
Boasting unrivaled power, Brute Justice dominates opposing players and machina on the battlefield, while also laying waste to structures with its lethal armaments. Although it can easily turn the tide of battle, there are strict conditions governing its deployment.
135,■Machina Restrictions
Only one machina may be operated per party at any given time, regardless of type. In the case of the Oppressor, however, the limit is two per team. Two Brute Justices can be deployed by each team per match, one becoming available for each tower you lose.

■Riding Machina
When deploying a machina, its HP will be displayed in place of the player. Its HP cannot be restored by curative actions of teammates, nor will it restore automatically when out of combat. Machina actions will expend EP, a resource that can only be restored by using the Ceruleum Refill action. Be advised that use of this action will deplete your party's ceruleum stores.

■Ceruleum
Ceruleum is required to operate machina. A maximum of 100 units of ceruleum can be stored by each party. You can build up your ceruleum stores by collecting tanks in the field, controlling the power generator, or defeating enemy team members and mammets. As ceruleum is a party resource, it is recommended that you confer with your comrades prior to activating a machina.
136,■Hangar Terminals
Once your team has sufficient ceruleum, you can choose a machina to deploy at the hangar terminal, located near the starting area. You may also view information relating to the various types of machina.
137,Mammets
138,Mammets are clockwork soldiers programmed to seek out and destroy towers and cores. They emerge from their own core at regular intervals before striking out on a set route, and will remain in battle for a set duration. Upon detecting an enemy mammet, they will engage and attack until either side is destroyed. Mammets that arrive at an enemy tower or core will perform a powerful self-sacrificing attack. That is the extent of their programming; mammets will not harm adventurers.
139,■Wind-up Viking
These mammets specialize in fighting at close quarters.
140,■Wind-up Magus
These mammets specialize in magic-based attacks.
141,■Fighting Alongside Mammets
Mammets are governed by the Clockwork status which counts down to zero, after which they are removed from battle.
Although it is possible to use healing actions on mammets, the amount of HP restored is reduced.

■Gaining Ceruleum from Mammets
Parties gain units of ceruleum upon defeating an enemy mammet. These units will be distributed to all parties that engage with the mammet based on the amount of damage inflicted. Ceruleum cannot be gained from damage inflicted by other mammets.
142,Steam Cannons
143,Two steam cannons have been erected near each team's core. While they cannot be moved, they are powerful weapons which may prove useful in deterring enemy forces.
144,Soaring
145,When you defeat an enemy team member, your party receives the Soaring enhancing effect. This effect can stack up to twenty times, increasing all party members' damage dealt and HP restored via healing actions, while also reducing damage taken. At twenty stacks, Soaring will be replaced with the Flying High effect, which confers even greater benefits.
146,■Soaring Stacks
The number of Soaring stacks an enemy has when defeated affects how many stacks your party gains.
Defeat an enemy with 0 to 9 stacks: gain 1 stack
Defeat an enemy with 10 to 19 stacks: gain 2 stacks
Defeat an enemy with 20 stacks (Flying High): gain 3 stacks

152,Hidden Gorge
153,Map Overview
154,Developed by Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern at great cost, the mine at Hidden Gorge proved to be a flash in the pan, its veins running dry within a matter of years. For a time afterwards, the site in Thanalan lay abandoned, but now it has been revived as a training ground for adventurers. On tracks of steel the goblin-made ceruleum engines arrive, laden with supplies that combatants should seize if they hope to claim victory.
155,Ceruleum Engines
156,Ceruleum engines move across the map on rails at high speed, stopping at the loading stations in the center of the map. By taking control of the loading stations, teams can claim the supplies delivered by the ceruleum engines.

■Ceruleum Engines in Motion
If you come into contact with a ceruleum engine while it is moving, you will incur potentially lethal damage.
A warning will sound to indicate the approach of a ceruleum engine.
157,■Loading Stations
Ceruleum engines deliver supplies to loading stations. Players cannot enter a loading station while riding machina. Each team may occupy or control a loading station.

■Occupying a Loading Station
When a ceruleum engine arrives at a station, standing in the area next to the engine will cause a gauge to fill. Once it is full, your team will occupy that station. The gauge fills more quickly when you have a higher number of team members near the engine than the opponent. The greater the difference in players, the quicker the gauge fills. However, only the first four players from each team are counted. Those standing near the engine will also gain the Sheer Will status, which greatly increases damage dealt. Making use of this status will help to reduce the number of enemies and occupy the station more quickly.

■Controlling a Loading Station
Once a loading station has been occupied, a new gauge will appear indicating your control over the station. When filled, the station will be under your team's control, allowing you to claim its supplies. This gauge will only fill when your team has a number of members equal to or higher than the opponent in that area.
When the supplies have been claimed, the ceruleum engine will leave the station and the gauges will be reset.
158,■Supplies
There are four types of supplies. For the first half of the match, the ceruleum engine will deliver main ceruleum tanks, gobbiejuice, and gobtank keys at random. In the second half of the match, they will only deliver gobcrates.
Each type grants its own benefits and increases the Soaring stacks of the whole team.

Main Ceruleum Tanks
Each party on the team gains 50 ceruleum.

Gobbiejuice
Fills the adrenaline gauge of every team member.

Gobtanks
Two gobtanks will appear at the core and will travel down the north and south routes to the enemy base. They are considerably more powerful than regular mammets and can deal severe damage to towers and the core.

Gobcrates
Grant all of the effects of main ceruleum tanks, gobbiejuice, and gobtanks.
159,Goblin Mercenaries 
160,After a certain amount of time has passed, goblin mercenaries will randomly appear from the north and south mercenary bases. Initially, they will not side with either team, and will attack any player that approaches. However, it is possible to have them ally with your team.
161,■Allied Mercenaries
If the damage your team deals to a goblin mercenary surpasses that of the opposing team by a certain amount, it will join your side. If the mercenary's HP reaches zero before this condition has been fulfilled, it will form an alliance with whichever team dealt the most damage to it.

■Mercenary Deployment
Once you have formed an alliance with a mercenary, it will appear at your team's core and will attempt to destroy the enemy's towers and core, much like a mammet would. Forming an alliance with a mercenary that appeared from the north mercenary base will cause it to travel along the northern route, with the same being true of the south mercenary base and southern route.
Mercenaries are also governed by the Contractual Obligation status, and they will leave the field of battle once the status counts down to zero. After a certain amount of time passes, they will reappear from their respective base and will no longer be allied with either team.

179,In a company workshop, you may craft company projects and build airships and submersibles to embark on exploratory voyages.

Once gil has been paid for the construction of the company workshop, it can be accessed via the door inside the estate hall.


■Demolishing a Company Workshop
If a company workshop is no longer needed, it can be demolished. Please note that doing so will delete all records of the activities performed there, including progress made on exploratory voyages. In addition, the gil spent on purchasing the facility will not be refunded.

If you are dismissed from your free company, your private chambers will be demolished, and furnishings placed in your private chambers will be given into the care of the resident caretaker. Furnishings will be held by the resident caretaker for 35 days (Earth time), after which they will be permanently discarded. Only the former owner of the private chamber can claim these furnishings, not other members of the free company to whom the estate belongs.

Furthermore, you may evict tenants at any time by selecting their name, followed by “Evict”.

186,12. Relocation
187,It is possible to relocate your estate hall to a new plot. Private estates may be relocated by their owners at will, while free company estates require those with authority to purchase and relinquish land.

Upon relocation, placed furnishings will be put in the storeroom at the destination plot, save for the chocobo stables and the miniature aetheryte, which will be placed in the garden. In the event that there are too many furnishings to fit in the storeroom, the estate cannot be relocated until they have been removed.

Private chambers and company workshops will be moved in their entirety and retain their state.

Interior fixtures, meanwhile, will remain intact, unless the relocation results in an estate hall with fewer floors. In this case, the fixtures will be lost alongside the floor.

Estate halls which have not been entered by their owner for thirty days (Earth time) cannot be relocated. Furthermore, initiating a relocation has the same effect as the owner entering his or her estate hall, and resets the period until auto-demolition.


188,13. Storerooms
189,All types of housing come with a storeroom for keeping one's furnishings. The larger the residence, the bigger the storeroom. The maximum number of furnishings that can be stored is as follows:

　・Small: 200 indoor, 20 outdoor
　・Medium: 300 indoor, 30 outdoor

Any items equipped on a mannequin that are listed for sale still occupy slots in the retainer's list. For that reason, a mannequin cannot be equipped with items that would cause the retainer to exceed the 20 item limit.

■Selling as a Set
By checking “Sell Only as Set,” you can sell all items equipped to the mannequin together. While the items may be viewed on the market board, a player must access the mannequin directly if they wish to purchase the set.

When viewing items listed on the market board as part of a set, it is possible to send a tell to the seller to ascertain the location of their estate. 
※Please be aware that it is possible to view the name of a character selling a set through the market board.

■Displaying Gear
You may also display items on a mannequin without listing the gear for sale. It is also possible to select unsellable items for display.
※The mannequin cannot be used to display glamoured items.

However, gear that is displayed also occupies slots in the retainer's list of items for sale on the market, despite not being available for purchase.
