29,"Doman Mahjong for Beginners"
30,"1. Introduction"
31,"Doman mahjong is a game for four players. The following guide covers the basic rules."
32,"2. What is Doman Mahjong?"
33,"In Doman mahjong, players <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>race to complete a winning hand of 14 tiles, with points awarded for speed and difficulty of the hand<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.
Players begin with 13 tiles and draw a new tile each turn. They must then choose a tile to discard: either the new tile or one of the tiles in their hand. The player to the right then takes a turn, and the process is repeated until the end of the hand.

The first player to complete a winning hand is awarded points. A total of eight hands are played in a full match and four in a quick match, and the player who finishes with the most points is declared the winner.
Here is an example of a winning hand:"
34,"The 14 tiles form <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>four groups of three tiles and one pair of matching tiles<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>. A group of tiles is known as a “meld,” and the various types are explained in this guide. The combination of melds determines the difficulty of the hand and the points awarded when winning.

"
35,"3. The Tiles"
36,"Mahjong tiles are divided into “number tiles” and “honor tiles.”

■ Number Tiles
There are three suits of number tiles, each ranging from 1 to 9.
"
37,"■ Honor Tiles
There are two suits of honor tiles: the four wind tiles and the three dragon tiles. Unlike number tiles, they appear in no particular sequence, and therefore cannot be used to form straights. They can only form melds with identical tiles."
38,"There are 34 varieties of tile, with four of each for a total of 136.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Players aim to form a winning hand of 14 tiles before the other players and earn as many points as possible.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
"
39,"4. Forming Melds"
40,"■ Straights
Number tiles may form straights such as 2, 3, 4 or 4, 5, 6, provided the tiles are all in the same suit. However, sequences such as 8, 9, 1 or 9, 1, 2 are not permitted."
41,"■ Triplets
Number tiles and honor tiles can also form matching triplets with identical tiles."
42,"A winning hand consists of 14 tiles and requires four melds and one matching pair.

※There are special combinations that ignore this particular rule, but beginners should focus on learning the basic hands first.

"
43,"5. Order of Play"
44,"Each of the four players begins with 13 tiles, and the dealer─who is chosen automatically─plays first.
That player draws one new tile and chooses one tile to discard. This may either be the new tile or one from their hand.
Once that player has discarded a tile, the player to the right takes a turn. This process is repeated until the end of the hand."
45,"The hand ends when a player calls a winning hand. The hand also ends if all of the tiles are drawn with no player calling a winning hand."
46,"At the start of a new hand, the role of dealer passes to the player on the right. In a full match, a round consists of eight hands, during which time the role of dealer passes around the board twice. The player with the highest score at the end of the round is declared the winner. In a quick match, only four hands are played.

"
47,"6. Points for a Winning Hand"
48,"Each player begins the game with 25,000 points, which increase when calling a winning hand. However, points may be deducted when another player calls a winning hand.

A winning hand can be formed in one of two ways:
"
49,"1. Tsumo: When a tile is drawn
When a winning hand is formed with a tile drawn by the player, the point value is calculated, and each of the other three players pays this point cost.
If the dealer calls a winning hand, the point value is increased by 50%.
If the dealer has to pay another player, they must pay double."
50,"2. Ron: When another player discards a tile
If a player discards a tile that allows another player to form a winning hand, only the player that discarded the tile must pay.
When the dealer forms a winning hand in this manner, the point value is increased by 50%. However, if the dealer is the player who discarded the tile, only the standard amount is paid."
51,"The dealer has the advantage of earning 50% more points from a winning hand.
In addition, when a dealer calls the winning hand, the <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>role of dealer does not pass to the next player<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, thus giving the dealer an opportunity to score even more points."
52,"7. Yaku, Required for a Winning Hand"
53,"As mahjong revolves around scoring as many points as possible, it is important to know the difference between low-scoring and high-scoring hands."
54,"The value of a hand is determined by “yaku”─specific combinations of melds. The value of each yaku is measured in “han,” with 6 han being the highest and 1 han the lowest. The harder the yaku is to form, the more han it is worth."
55,"The han value of the hand is used to calculate the number of points awarded.
Points are awarded as follows:"
56,"　1 Han     1,000 Points
　2 Han     2,000 Points
　3 Han     3,900 Points

　4 Han     8,000 Points
　5 Han     8,000 Points

　6 Han     12,000 Points
　7 Han     12,000 Points

　8 Han　 16,000 Points
　9 Han　 16,000 Points
　10 Han   16,000 Points

　11 Han    24,000 Points
　12 Han    24,000 Points

　13 Han and higher     32,000 Points"
57,"In certain situations, further calculations are involved which may lead to point increases."
58,"As yaku are used to calculate the points earned, <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>a winning hand must contain at least one yaku<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.
Although a winning hand normally requires four melds and a matching pair, this alone does not constitute a winning hand.

"
59,"8. Basic Yaku"
60,"There are many types of yaku, but we recommend learning these basic yaku first:"
61,"■ Tanyao
Only number tiles from 2 to 8 are used.
The hand cannot contain any honor tiles or tiles numbered 1 or 9."
62,"■ All Pon
Four matching triplets and a matching double."
63,"■ Pure Straight
Contains numbers 1 to 9 of the same suit. Presented as three triplets of 1, 2, 3, then 4, 5, 6, and 7, 8, 9."
64,"■ Mixed Triple Chi
The same straight, for example, 1, 2, 3, in each suit."
65,"■ Half Flush
Number tiles from a single suit plus honor tiles."
66,"■ Full Flush
Only number tiles from one suit."
67,"Please refer to the Lodestone for a full list of yaku and other useful information.

"
68,"9. Riichi Yaku"
69,"A special condition known as “riichi” makes it easier to form a yaku."
70,"The hand in the diagram only requires a 3 or a 6 of Dots to form a winning hand.
When a player is one tile away from a winning hand, riichi may be declared."
71,"When the hand is ready for declaring riichi, the player will have the option to do so before discarding a tile. In the case shown in the diagram, if the declaring player receives a 3 or a 6 of Dots, whether the tile is drawn by the player or discarded by another player, a winning hand can be called.
After declaring riichi, that player can no longer put drawn tiles into their hand. Any tiles drawn will automatically be discarded until a tile that completes the winning hand is obtained. However, a winning hand achieved through riichi is a yaku in itself. Therefore, the player does not need to have formed any other yaku to complete a winning hand."
72,"■ Properties of Riichi
　1. The player's hand automatically becomes a yaku, regardless of whether it contains any other yaku.
　2. The other players know that the one declaring riichi is one tile away from a winning hand.
　3. The declaring player cannot replace any of the tiles in their hand.
　4. The declaring player must pay 1,000 points─indicated with a point stick placed in the center of the table─which go to the winner of the hand.

"
73,"10. Yaku Tiles"
74,"The honor tiles offer another method for forming a yaku."
75,"A triplet of any of these three tiles forms a yaku."
76,"The wind tiles can be used to form a yaku in a similar fashion, although certain conditions apply."
77,"■ Round-specific Conditions
A game of Doman mahjong is divided into eight hands. The first round, in which the role of dealer passes to each player once, is called “East.” A triplet of east wind tiles forms a yaku in this round. The second round, “South,” allows a yaku to be formed with a triplet of south wind tiles."
78,"■ Seat-specific Conditions
Each player is assigned a “seat wind” according to their seating position in relation to the dealer.

　Dealer = East
　Dealer's right = South
　Opposite the dealer = West
　Dealer's left = North

The seat wind for each player changes counterclockwise in this order: East, South, West, North. (This layout differs from the standard compass directions.) A triplet of wind tiles with the current seat wind forms a yaku.
The seat wind rotates together with the role of dealer, and players have a chance to easily form a yaku by paying attention to their seat wind marker."
79,"11. Pon and Chi"
80,"It is difficult to form a winning hand relying solely on drawn tiles. However, tiles discarded by other players can be claimed by using “pon” and “chi.”"
81,"■ Pon
If you have a pair of matching tiles, when another player discards a tile that can be used to form a triplet, you may call pon to claim the tile."
82,"■ Chi
Calling chi allows you to claim a number tile discarded by another player and complete a straight. However, it can only be called for the player whose turn comes before yours."
83,"Although pon and chi allow you to form a winning hand more quickly, there are some drawbacks."
84,"■ Drawback 1: Revealing Your Hand
Using pon or chi to form a triplet or straight will cause it to be revealed to the other players. In addition, you can no longer use those tiles for any other melds.
This can lead to missing opportunities to form better hands as a result of having those tiles locked into a triplet or straight."
85,"■ Drawback 2: Preventing Riichi
It is not possible to declare riichi after using pon or chi.
Due to being unable to form a riichi yaku, you must find a way to form a different yaku. There are also certain yaku that can only be formed on the condition that you have not used pon or chi, so these will also become unavailable. In some cases, pon and chi will limit your ability to score points."
86,"12. Dora Bonuses"
87,"In each hand, certain tiles are selected as “dora” and will grant bonus han simply for being included in a winning hand. While dora apply han bonuses, they are not in themselves yaku, so a yaku must be formed in order to take advantage of dora."
88,"■ Dora
A dora tile is randomly selected at the start of each hand and is displayed throughout."
89,"■ Aka Dora
Each suit contains four number 5 tiles. One of these four is colored red, and is known as the “aka dora.” Simply including an aka dora adds one bonus han to a winning hand. There are three aka dora in total, one for each suit."
90,"■ Ura Dora
When calling a winning hand after declaring riichi, the “ura dora” is revealed. This is only shown after the winning hand has been called and is nothing more than a surprise bonus, although it provides added incentive to try declaring riichi.

"
91,"13. Kan"
92,"Since there are four of each tile, it is possible to collect all four. This is known as “kan.”"
93,"Although kan is not in itself a yaku, it awards additional bonuses when calculating the points earned by a winning hand. Kan also increases the number of dora, which may offer further advantages.
Similarly to pon and chi, calling kan locks those tiles, preventing them from being replaced or used in other melds."
94,"14. Learn by Playing"
95,"Doman mahjong is a complex game even once you have learned all of the rules. However, many of the actions normally carried out by players themselves are performed automatically, so feel free to head to the tables and try your luck without worrying about the less important details. Why not start at the novices' table?

Once you have a grasp of the basics, you may wish to challenge other adventurers via the Duty Finder.
For details on the more advanced rules, please refer to the guide on the Lodestone."
96,"Playing Mahjong"
97,"NPC Matches"
98,"The Gold Saucer offers games against novice, intermediate, and advanced opponents."
99,"It is also possible to challenge these opponents while waiting for a party in the Duty Finder. However, the game will be abandoned if the Duty Finder matches you with a party and you choose to enter the duty."
100,"Player Matches"
101,"You may challenge other players to matches via the Gold Saucer tab in the Duty Finder.

"
102,"■ Rules
・Each player has a certain amount of time to take their turn. A tile will be discarded automatically if that player fails to act within the time limit. This time limit does not apply to four-player mahjong (kuitan enabled/disabled).
・A time limit applies to the period between hands. In addition, if a single hand lasts more than 80 minutes, the following hand will be the last one played. Once that hand ends, the game ends, final placements are decided, and the results are recorded.
・Each game has a time limit of 120 minutes, after which the game will end automatically. Results will not be recorded.
"
103,"■ Chat
・During a four-player mahjong game, you may chat to the other players.
・Chat can be toggled on and off using the button in the lower right of the screen. Turning chat off will prevent you from sending and receiving messages. On-screen icons indicate whether the other players are participating in the chat.
"
104,"■ Rating and Rank
・Matches played in “Novice Mahjong (Ranked)” and “Advanced Mahjong (Ranked)” will affect your rating and rank.
・Your rating starts at 1,500, and will increase or decrease according to your finishing position in each match.
・Although you cannot be demoted while in the lower ranks, progressing to the higher ranks puts you at risk of demotion should you perform poorly.
・Ratings and ranks are calculated only according to the rating of your opponents and your finishing position in the game.
(The number of points with which you end a game is not taken into consideration.)
・Your mahjong rating and rank can be viewed in the Gold Saucer menu, under Mahjong.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>※Rating and rank data is saved locally. If you log in using another platform, your rating and rank will not be displayed."
105,"■ Abandoning a Match
・If players log out during a mahjong match, tiles will be discarded automatically when their turn comes around. When players log back in, they will regain control from the next turn onwards.
・If players abandon a match, it will continue without them and their tiles will be discarded automatically. They will also incur the standard penalties for abandoning a duty and will be unable to register for another mahjong match until the previous match ends.
・If players do not enter any commands for a certain amount of time, they will be automatically removed from the match.

106,"Navigating the Screen"
107,"Understanding the UI"
108,"1. Shows the 13 tiles in your hand. When you draw a tile, it is shown as the 14th tile, to the right of your hand. When your turn comes, select a tile to discard it."
109,"2. When you are in a position to call riichi, tsumo, ron, pon, chi, or kan, a prompt will appear. In the case of pon, chi, and kan, this prompt can be hidden.
To hide these prompts, set Display Calls to Off. However, this option defaults to On at the start of a new hand.

If you turn on “Auto-declare winning hand,” you will automatically declare a winning hand as soon as tsumo or ron become available. This option defaults to Off at the start of a new hand.
"
110,"3. The star icon indicates which player is the dealer. It is also displayed in the center of the table.
The compass direction shown below each player's name is their current seat wind. Players can form a yaku by collecting three wind tiles that match their seat wind. The role of dealer rotates counterclockwise, from east, to south, to west, to north.

"
111,"4. A game of Doman mahjong is played over eight hands. The first four are the “East” round and the last four are the “South” round. Collecting three wind tiles that match the current round forms a yaku.

"
112,"5. These sticks indicate any points carried over in the event of a draw. If a player declares riichi, the 1,000 points they pay are also shown here. When a player wins a hand, these points are added to their score. A stick with several black dots is worth 100 points and a stick with a single red dot is worth 1,000 points.
Every time a hand is replayed, a special bonus known as “honba” increases by one, also indicated here. When a player produces a winning hand, they will receive an additional 300 points for each honba.

"
113,"6. Indicates the dora for the current hand. If a player includes a tile identical to the dora in a winning hand, they will receive bonus han, which increases points earned."
114,"7. Buttons for toggling the various settings. For more information, see Support Features in the Playing Mahjong section.

"
115,"Support Features"
116,"■ Dangerous Tile Marker
When discarding a tile, there is always a risk that an opponent may claim that tile to strengthen their position or even win the hand. These markers indicate which tiles carry a high risk of being claimed by an opponent.
Remember, even the tiles without markers are not entirely without risk, but enabling this feature may help you to avoid defeat."
117,"The most dangerous tiles will have this kind of marker."
118,"You should also be wary of tiles with these markers."
119,"■ Hints
Enable this feature for recommendations on which tiles to discard, whether to call pon or chi, and so on. While following this advice will not always lead to victory, you may find it useful.

121,"Rival Wings"
122,"Overview"
123,"Rival Wings is a large-scale PvP battle involving up to 48 combatants. Participants are divided into two teams, the Falcons and the Ravens.
Each team may pilot powerful machina as they attempt to destroy the opponent's core, which is defended by mammets."
124,"■Basic Rules
A Rival Wings team consists of 6 light parties, for a total of 24 participants.
A match lasts for 15 minutes.

■Retaliation
Incapacitated players will be returned to their landing point, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. Furthermore, players will be invulnerable so long as they remain at their landing point. This effect will be lost upon returning to the battlefield.

■Mounts
Players are free to use mounts during Rival Wings campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be afflicted with the Limp status effect.

■Return 
Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Rival Wings campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

■Rewards
When a match has ended, players will receive PvP EXP, PvE EXP, Wolf Marks, and Allagan tomestones.
By continually winning Rival Wings matches, players will receive achievements that reward special mounts and gear."
125,"Cores and Towers"
126,"The first team to destroy the core located on the opponent's base will be declared the winner. In the event neither team destroys a core, the team that deals the most damage to the opponent's core wins. If both teams have dealt the same amount of damage to each other's cores, the number of remaining towers─which protect the core─determines victory. Should the number of remaining towers be the same for both teams, the amount of damage dealt to the towers determines the winners."
127,"■Cores
Each team has a core located at its base, and the chief objective is to destroy the enemy's core. The core is protected by a magitek field emanating from two towers, so before you can strike at the core, you must first destroy at least one of the towers."
128,"■Towers
Each team has two towers that serve to protect their core. Each tower is also enveloped in a defensive field that mitigates damage taken by team members and restores their HP, which players can take advantage of as protection when hard-pressed by the opposing team. If you succeed in destroying the enemy team's towers, the magitek field around the enemy team's base will dissipate, and your team will earn Soaring stacks."
129,"■Magitek Fields
Each team has two towers which project a magitek field to guard the core. While both towers are present, the core cannot be damaged, and the field deals severe damage over time to any enemies that enter.
If one of the towers is destroyed, the defensive effect of the magitek field is weakened, allowing damage to be dealt to the core. In addition, the magitek field will no longer deal damage to enemies.
When both towers are destroyed, the magitek field disappears and the core will receive full damage from enemy attacks."
130,"Machina"
131,"Players can deploy three types of powerful machina in battle."
132,"■Cruise Chaser
A next-generation machina ideal for combat against enemy players and machina. While it possesses a high degree of mobility, it lacks in durability."
133,"■Oppressor 
A hulking machina engineered for siege warfare, it excels at wreaking havoc upon structures. However, it is slow and poorly suited to combating enemy players and machina."
134,"■Brute Justice
Boasting unrivaled power, Brute Justice dominates opposing players and machina on the battlefield, while also laying waste to structures with its lethal armaments. Although it can easily turn the tide of battle, there are strict conditions governing its deployment."
135,"■Machina Restrictions
Only one machina may be operated per party at any given time, regardless of type. In the case of the Oppressor, however, the limit is two per team. Two Brute Justices can be deployed by each team per match, one becoming available for each tower you lose.

■Riding Machina
When deploying a machina, its HP will be displayed in place of the player. Its HP cannot be restored by curative actions of teammates, nor will it restore automatically when out of combat. Machina actions will expend EP, a resource that can only be restored by using the Ceruleum Refill action. Be advised that use of this action will deplete your party's ceruleum stores.

■Ceruleum
Ceruleum is required to operate machina. A maximum of 100 units of ceruleum can be stored by each party. You can build up your ceruleum stores by collecting tanks in the field, controlling the power generator, or defeating enemy team members and mammets. As ceruleum is a party resource, it is recommended that you confer with your comrades prior to activating a machina."
136,"■Hangar Terminals
Once your team has sufficient ceruleum, you can choose a machina to deploy at the hangar terminal, located near the starting area. You may also view information relating to the various types of machina."
137,"Mammets"
138,"Mammets are clockwork soldiers programmed to seek out and destroy towers and cores. They emerge from their own core at regular intervals before striking out on a set route, and will remain in battle for a set duration. Upon detecting an enemy mammet, they will engage and attack until either side is destroyed. Mammets that arrive at an enemy tower or core will perform a powerful self-sacrificing attack. That is the extent of their programming; mammets will not harm adventurers."
139,"■Wind-up Viking
These mammets specialize in fighting at close quarters."
140,"■Wind-up Magus
These mammets specialize in magic-based attacks."
141,"■Fighting Alongside Mammets
Mammets are governed by the Clockwork status which counts down to zero, after which they are removed from battle.
Although it is possible to use healing actions on mammets, the amount of HP restored is reduced.

■Gaining Ceruleum from Mammets
Parties gain units of ceruleum upon defeating an enemy mammet. These units will be distributed to all parties that engage with the mammet based on the amount of damage inflicted. Ceruleum cannot be gained from damage inflicted by other mammets."
142,"Steam Cannons"
143,"Two steam cannons have been erected near each team's core. While they cannot be moved, they are powerful weapons which may prove useful in deterring enemy forces."
144,"Soaring"
145,"When you defeat an enemy team member, your party receives the Soaring enhancing effect. This effect can stack up to twenty times, increasing all party members' damage dealt and HP restored via healing actions, while also reducing damage taken. At twenty stacks, Soaring will be replaced with the Flying High effect, which confers even greater benefits."
146,"■Soaring Stacks
The number of Soaring stacks an enemy has when defeated affects how many stacks your party gains.
Defeat an enemy with 0 to 9 stacks: gain 1 stack
Defeat an enemy with 10 to 19 stacks: gain 2 stacks
Defeat an enemy with 20 stacks (Flying High): gain 3 stacks

152,"Hidden Gorge"
153,"Map Overview"
154,"Developed by Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern at great cost, the mine at Hidden Gorge proved to be a flash in the pan, its veins running dry within a matter of years. For a time afterwards, the site in Thanalan lay abandoned, but now it has been revived as a training ground for adventurers. On tracks of steel the goblin-made ceruleum engines arrive, laden with supplies that combatants should seize if they hope to claim victory."
155,"Ceruleum Engines"
156,"Ceruleum engines move across the map on rails at high speed, stopping at the loading stations in the center of the map. By taking control of the loading stations, teams can claim the supplies delivered by the ceruleum engines.

■Ceruleum Engines in Motion
If you come into contact with a ceruleum engine while it is moving, you will incur potentially lethal damage.
A warning will sound to indicate the approach of a ceruleum engine."
157,"■Loading Stations
Ceruleum engines deliver supplies to loading stations. Players cannot enter a loading station while riding machina. Each team may occupy or control a loading station.

■Occupying a Loading Station
When a ceruleum engine arrives at a station, standing in the area next to the engine will cause a gauge to fill. Once it is full, your team will occupy that station. The gauge fills more quickly when you have a higher number of team members near the engine than the opponent. The greater the difference in players, the quicker the gauge fills. However, only the first four players from each team are counted. Those standing near the engine will also gain the Sheer Will status, which greatly increases damage dealt. Making use of this status will help to reduce the number of enemies and occupy the station more quickly.

■Controlling a Loading Station
Once a loading station has been occupied, a new gauge will appear indicating your control over the station. When filled, the station will be under your team's control, allowing you to claim its supplies. This gauge will only fill when your team has a number of members equal to or higher than the opponent in that area.
When the supplies have been claimed, the ceruleum engine will leave the station and the gauges will be reset."
158,"■Supplies
There are four types of supplies. For the first half of the match, the ceruleum engine will deliver main ceruleum tanks, gobbiejuice, and gobtank keys at random. In the second half of the match, they will only deliver gobcrates.
Each type grants its own benefits and increases the Soaring stacks of the whole team.

Main Ceruleum Tanks
Each party on the team gains 50 ceruleum.

Gobbiejuice
Fills the adrenaline gauge of every team member.

Gobtanks
Two gobtanks will appear at the core and will travel down the north and south routes to the enemy base. They are considerably more powerful than regular mammets and can deal severe damage to towers and the core.

Gobcrates
Grant all of the effects of main ceruleum tanks, gobbiejuice, and gobtanks."
159,"Goblin Mercenaries "
160,"After a certain amount of time has passed, goblin mercenaries will randomly appear from the north and south mercenary bases. Initially, they will not side with either team, and will attack any player that approaches. However, it is possible to have them ally with your team."
161,"■Allied Mercenaries
If the damage your team deals to a goblin mercenary surpasses that of the opposing team by a certain amount, it will join your side. If the mercenary's HP reaches zero before this condition has been fulfilled, it will form an alliance with whichever team dealt the most damage to it.

■Mercenary Deployment
Once you have formed an alliance with a mercenary, it will appear at your team's core and will attempt to destroy the enemy's towers and core, much like a mammet would. Forming an alliance with a mercenary that appeared from the north mercenary base will cause it to travel along the northern route, with the same being true of the south mercenary base and southern route.
Mercenaries are also governed by the Contractual Obligation status, and they will leave the field of battle once the status counts down to zero. After a certain amount of time passes, they will reappear from their respective base and will no longer be allied with either team."

■Relinquishing Land
If you no longer wish to own a particular plot of land, select “Relinquish Land” from the Housing menu. Please note that the purchasing price will not be refunded.

　2. Once the estate hall has not been entered for a total of forty-five days (Earth time), it will be demolished, and the plot will be put up for sale.
While any member of a free company may enter a company estate hall to prevent auto-demolition, only the owner can prevent the auto-demolition of a private estate.

■Reclaiming Funds and Furnishings Following Auto-demolition
In the event your estate is demolished and your plot is sold, you will be able to claim indemnification for 80% of the plot's value. Furthermore, furnishings which can be safely removed will be stored for safekeeping by the resident caretaker. However, you must speak with the resident caretaker within thirty-five days (Earth time) of auto-demolition to reclaim funds and furnishings.

Once gil has been paid for the construction of the company workshop, it can be accessed via the door inside the estate hall.


■Demolishing a Company Workshop
If a company workshop is no longer needed, it can be demolished. Please note that doing so will delete all records of the activities performed there, including progress made on exploratory voyages. In addition, the gil spent on purchasing the facility will not be refunded.
Before a company workshop can be demolished, any airships and submersibles currently in service must be dismantled.

If you are dismissed from your free company, your private chambers will be demolished, and furnishings placed in your private chambers will be given into the care of the resident caretaker. Furnishings will be held by the resident caretaker for 35 days (Earth time), after which they will be permanently discarded. Only the former owner of the private chamber can claim these furnishings, not other members of the free company to whom the estate belongs.

186,"12. Relocation"
187,"It is possible to relocate your estate hall to a new plot. Private estates may be relocated by their owners at will, while free company estates require those with authority to purchase and relinquish land.

When making the purchase, approximately 15% of the value of the old plot will be applied towards the price of the new.

Upon relocation, placed furnishings will be put in the storeroom at the destination plot, save for the chocobo stables and the miniature aetheryte, which will be placed in the garden. In the event that there are too many furnishings to fit in the storeroom, the estate cannot be relocated until they have been removed.

Private chambers and company workshops will be moved in their entirety and retain their state.

Interior fixtures, meanwhile, will remain intact, unless the relocation results in an estate hall with fewer floors. In this case, the fixtures will be lost alongside the floor.

Estate halls which have not been entered by their owner for thirty days (Earth time) cannot be relocated. Furthermore, initiating a relocation has the same effect as the owner entering his or her estate hall, and resets the period until auto-demolition.

"
188,"13. Storerooms"
189,"All types of housing come with a storeroom for keeping one's furnishings. The larger the residence, the bigger the storeroom. The maximum number of furnishings that can be stored is as follows:

　・Small: 200 indoor, 20 outdoor
　・Medium: 300 indoor, 30 outdoor

Any items equipped on a mannequin that are listed for sale still occupy slots in the retainer's list. For that reason, a mannequin cannot be equipped with items that would cause the retainer to exceed the 20 item limit.

■Selling as a Set
By checking “Sell Only as Set,” you can sell all items equipped to the mannequin together. While the items may be viewed on the market board, a player must access the mannequin directly if they wish to purchase the set.

■Displaying Gear
You may also display items on a mannequin without listing the gear for sale. It is also possible to select unsellable items for display.

269,"Frontline"
270,"Overview"
271,"In Frontline battles, the Maelstrom, the Twin Adders, and the Immortal Flames face each other in training exercises devised to test the participants' strategic planning and combat prowess."
272,"The Basics"
273,"Frontline is a PvP challenge which engages three teams of adventurers, each team representing one of the three Grand Companies. Players will be randomly assigned to one of these three teams, regardless of their Grand Company allegiance. Each team consists of up to 24 players in an alliance, allowing for a grand total of 72 players in a single battle.
Success on the front line will depend heavily not only on individual skill, but on your ability to work as a team."
274,"■Rules
A Frontline alliance consists of 24 members, divided into 3 full parties. There are 3 alliances, which combine for a total of 72 participants.
A match lasts for 20 minutes.

■Retaliation
Incapacitated players will be returned to their Grand Company's landing, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. This will not incur a weakness penalty.
Furthermore, players will be temporarily invulnerable when leaving their Grand Company's landing.

■Mounts
Players are free to use mounts during Frontline campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be afflicted with the Limp status effect.

■Return
Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Frontline campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

■KDA
Each time a player incapacitates an enemy player, they are awarded a knockout (K). When a player is incapacitated, they are classed as “down” (D). If a player deals damage to an enemy that is then incapacitated by a teammate, they are awarded an assist (A). The final K, D, and A for each player is displayed on the results screen at the end of the battle.

■Rewards
When a match has ended, players will receive PvP EXP, PvE EXP, Wolf Marks, and Allagan tomestones.
By continually winning Frontline matches, players will receive achievements that reward special mounts and gear."
275,"Battle High"
276,"Battle High is a status that increases damage dealt and HP restored by healing actions according to a player's knockouts and assists. The maximum Battle High value is 100, and for every increment of 20, the status increases in strength. Being incapacitated will reduce the Battle High value by half."
277,"The Borderland Ruins (Secure)"
278,"Map Overview"
279,"While many will remember the Calamity for the destruction it wrought upon the realm of Eorzea, that destruction was not without its blessings─one of those being the uncovering of ancient Allagan ruins hidden underneath the war-scarred Carteneau Flats and heretofore unseen for several Astral Eras. When an attempt by the Grand Companies of Eorzea to determine the control of these ruins, and more importantly the secrets they contain, through peaceful negotiations ended in failure, the city–states instead elected to solve the issue of dominion using a form of civilized warfare dubbed Frontline."
280,"Victory Conditions"
281,"In the Borderland Ruins (Secure), victory goes to the first alliance to reach the specified tactical rating, which is accumulated by:
　1. Defeating enemy players
　2. Occupying key locations
　3. Slaying monsters

In the event that none of the three alliances reaches the specified tactical rating within the time limit, victory will be awarded to the alliance with the highest tactical rating."
282,"Key Locations"
283,"Key locations such as outposts and Allagan ruins can be identified by flags, indicating the Grand Company that currently controls them. At the start of each match, all locations will be unoccupied. By remaining in close proximity to the flags at these locations, players can occupy them to improve their team's tactical rating. The location will become occupied more quickly when you have a higher number of team members near the flag than the opposing alliances. The greater the difference in players, the quicker it will be occupied. However, these areas may turn neutral should enemies come within proximity of a flag controlled by your team, or vice versa."
284,"Defeating Drones"
285,"During the match, drones will appear from the Heliodrome. They are not allied with any of the three teams, and defeating them will increase the tactical rating. Dealing damage to them will also increase the tactical rating, with the amount awarded to each alliance according to the proportion of damage dealt."
286,"The small interceptor drones will reappear a certain amount of time after they are defeated. The larger interceptor nodes will only appear once during the match, but will give greater increases in tactical rating when defeated."
287,"Seal Rock (Seize)"
288,"Map Overview"
289,"Legend has it that Llymlaen sealed a giant serpent She Herself created within Swallowtail Roam, an island said to drift about the sea so that those with evil intentions might never find it. When Seal Rock was first discovered, many believed it to be the selfsame island─but its true nature remained unknown until the Calamity laid her secrets bare. Upon their return to the island following the fall of Dalamud, Allied forces discovered Allagan tomeliths containing a wealth of knowledge. They concluded that the entire island was in fact an Allagan construct─a proving ground for Omega and other technology they developed to combat the primal threat. As was the case in Carteneau, control of the island and its resources remain disputed, and peaceful negotiations have failed to achieve a resolution. And so, once more, they would settle the matter on the battlefield."
290,"Victory Conditions"
291,"The first alliance to accumulate the required amount of data will be declared the winner, and the remaining alliances will be ranked according to their respective ratings. Data is accumulated by:

　1. Defeating enemy players
　2. Occupying Allagan tomeliths

In the event that none of the three alliances accumulates the required amount of data within the time limit, victory will be awarded to the alliance with the most data."
292,"Occupying Allagan Tomeliths"
293,"Seal Rock island is home to ancient relics known as Allagan tomeliths, structures containing data coveted by the three Grand Companies. Players must locate and occupy tomeliths to activate them and extract their data."
294,"■Active and Inactive Allagan Tomeliths
All Allagan tomeliths are inactive at the start of the campaign, and will activate randomly at set intervals. Each tomelith has a limited quantity of data that can be retrieved, and will become inactive once that limit is reached. As the campaign progresses, the maximum number of simultaneously active Allagan tomeliths will change.

■Occupying Allagan Tomeliths
Active Allagan tomeliths will be either “Unoccupied” or “Occupied” depending on whether or not a Grand Company has occupied them. If a player occupies an unoccupied tomelith, its status will change from Unoccupied to Occupied. If the tomelith is already occupied by an opposing faction, accessing the tomelith will change its status to Unoccupied. Tomeliths are Unoccupied when they change from inactive to active. Attempts to occupy a tomelith will be interrupted if the player is attacked.

■Allagan Tomelith Ranks
Allagan tomeliths will activate at one of three ranks: B, A, or S. Although tomeliths have a lower chance to activate at higher ranks, they hold a larger quantity of data that can be retrieved while they are occupied. As the match progresses, tomeliths will have an increased chance to activate at higher ranks.

■Changes According to Time Remaining
As time passes, the maximum number of tomeliths that can be active simultaneously decreases. However, it becomes easier to activate higher ranked tomeliths."
295,"The Fields of Glory (Shatter)"
296,"Map Overview"
297,"Under the influence of the lesser moon Dalamud, Nael van Darnus, legatus of the VIIth Legion, sought out and unearthed Allagan ruins in the eastern lowlands of Coerthas. Aided by the knowledge contained therein, he raised the very earth unto the heavens, and from this lofty perch did the White Raven nearly orchestrate the destruction of Eorzea.

The remnants of that mad plan still litter the frozen lowlands, as well as other ancient artifacts now laid bare. Though the powers that be are in agreement that Nael's data must be secured, they remain divided on the subject of how best to administer the region, which has prompted them to invoke the same laws which transformed Carteneau and Seal Rock into a battlefield. Where words fail, weapons speak."
298,"Victory Conditions"
299,"Similarly to Seal Rock (Seize), the first alliance to accumulate the required amount of data will be declared the winner, and the remaining alliances will be ranked according to their respective ratings. Data is accumulated by:

　1. Defeating enemy players
　2. Occupying Allagan tomeliths
　3. Destroying icebound tomeliths

In the event that none of the three alliances accumulates the required amount of data within the time limit, victory will be awarded to the alliance with the most data."
300,"Occupying Allagan Tomeliths"
301,"Allagan tomeliths will be either “Unoccupied” or “Occupied” depending on whether or not a Grand Company has occupied them. If a player occupies an unoccupied tomelith, its status will change from Unoccupied to Occupied. If the tomelith is already occupied by an opposing faction, accessing the tomelith will change its status to Unoccupied. Tomeliths are Unoccupied when they change from inactive to active."
302,"Destroying Icebound Tomeliths"
303,"The data from icebound tomeliths can be collected by attacking them, and once they are destroyed, data will be rewarded to each Grand Company based on the amount of damage inflicted.

■Activating Icebound Tomeliths
Icebound tomeliths can only be destroyed once they have become active. They will be inactive at the start of the campaign, and will activate at random after a fixed amount of time. Icebound tomeliths that have been destroyed will not reactivate. As time passes, more icebound tomeliths will activate, and the order in which they do so differs in every campaign. In some cases, several tomeliths may activate at the beginning of the campaign, while in others, they will activate at a steady pace. Regardless of the timing and frequency, all tomeliths on the map will be active by the end of the campaign.

■Icebound Tomelith
Active icebound tomeliths will be either large or small, with large tomeliths containing more data."
304,"Onsal Hakair (Danshig Naadam)"
305,"Map Overview"
306,"The Xaela of the Azim Steppe are renowned for their ferocity in battle, a traditional preoccupation that culminates once each Tsagaan Sar as they clash to earn the right to rule in the Naadam. Such infrequent conflict is insufficient to sate the Steppe's most zealous warriors, however, thus the Danshig Naadam─smaller contests to which the Grand Companies of Eorzea have now been welcomed. Join forces with the Maelstrom and the Orben people, the Adders and the Ejinn, or the Flames and the Horo in this grand demonstration of martial prowess, and may the mightiest prevail!"
307,"Victory Conditions"
308,"In Onsal Hakair (Danshig Naadam), victory goes to the first alliance to reach the specified tactical rating, which is accumulated by:
　1. Defeating enemy players
　2. Claiming ovoos

In the event that none of the three alliances reaches the specified tactical rating within the time limit, victory will be awarded to the alliance with the highest tactical rating."
309,"Ovoos"
310,"Across the field of battle, there are sacred sites known as ovoos. By laying claim to these locations, players can increase their team's tactical rating over time.

■Ovoo States
In the course of battle, an ovoo will assume one of four states, in the following order:

1. Inactive
While inactive, an ovoo cannot be claimed. All ovoos are inactive at the onset of battle, but as time passes, they will randomly begin activating."
311,"2. Activating
When an ovoo begins activating, a symbol will appear above it indicating the time remaining before it becomes active. The symbol will gradually take shape until it becomes complete, rendering the ovoo active."
312,"3. Active
When an ovoo is active, players can claim it for their team. If you are attacked in the midst of laying claim, the process will be interrupted."
313,"4. Claimed
When claimed, an ovoo gradually increases a team's tactical rating. A claimed ovoo cannot be seized by the opposition; however, after a certain amount of time has elapsed, it will revert to being inactive again."
314,"■Ovoo Rank
When an ovoo begins activating, it will randomly be assigned a rank: B, A, or S. While higher-ranked ovoos are rarer, they increase a team's tactical rating at a faster rate. The closer it is to the center of the battlefield, the greater the likelihood that an ovoo's rank will be high.

■Changes During Battle
As the battle progresses, the number of ovoos that can be simultaneously active will decrease. At the same time, the likelihood that they will activate at a higher rank will increase."

317,"Ocean Fishing"
318,"Description"
319,"Players can board the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis> to participate in Ocean Fishing, embarking on a journey across the high seas in search of strange and exotic fish."
320,"■Basic Rules
Up to 24 players may join an Ocean Fishing voyage, solo or in parties of up to eight members. Players will be matched together to form a full party when participating solo or with a party of fewer than eight members. Each voyage will sojourn at three locations before returning to Limsa Lominsa.

■How to Participate
Speak with Dryskthota at the ferry docks to register as a crew member and board the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis>. Registration periods last for 15 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time). If registering as a party, the party leader must register. The ship will depart when 24 crew members have been assembled or the registration period has ended, even if there are fewer than 24 crew members. Registration times may be viewed from the Sailing Schedule.

■Rewards
By meeting certain conditions while fishing during the voyage, players will receive achievements that reward special titles, mounts, and minions. Fishers who are level 50 or above and have completed the requisite quest may also receive gatherers' scrips as rewards."
321,"Specialty Bait"
322,"The Fishermen's Guild has developed special bait specifically for use in ocean fishing. While this bait can attract a wide variety of fish, it is not suitable to catch everything on your journey. Use a wide selection of bait to increase the size and diversity of your catch. Special bait can be purchased at the ferry docks or aboard the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis>."
323,"Spectral Currents"
324,"Spectral currents are a special weather effect that form under certain conditions. These currents carry a large number of fish, and provide ample opportunity to fill your inventory. Some types of fish only appear during spectral currents. "
325,"Points"
326,"Players will accumulate points during each voyage, and will receive rewards based on their final score upon returning to Limsa Lominsa. Scores will not be affected if the player releases their catch or if their equipment breaks during the voyage. Your current score is displayed in a special UI window, and a detailed breakdown of the score can be viewed by selecting Score Overview."
327,"Final Scores"
328,"When a voyage concludes, a player will see both their own score and the scores of other crew members. If certain conditions are met during the voyage, a bonus will be added to individual scores once the voyage ends.

■Individual Score
Here players can view their score, and also additional information
such as the fish they caught during the voyage and the number of bonus points they received.

■Group Scores
Here players can view their own score in addition to the highest 10 scores achieved by members of the same voyage. Players will be unable to view their scores or receive rewards if they abandon the voyage while it is still in progress."
329,"Bonuses"
330,"Players will receive bonuses to their score when they surpass certain milestones during each voyage. Examples of such milestones include catching more than a certain number of a specific fish solo or as a party, or catching a particularly rare fish.

Players may view which fish have contributed to bonuses from the Score Overview window during the voyage, or from the Individual Score window after the voyage has concluded."
331,"The Puppets' Bunker"
332,"On the Operation of YoRHa Units"
333,"YoRHa units are produced in a variety of models. Each model is distinguished by an alphabetical abbreviation indicating its area of specialization─such as “B” for combat-optimized Battle models, or “S” for the analytical Scanner models, operating as strategists. "
334,"On the Purpose of the Bunker"
335,"The Bunker was designed as a base for exclusive use by YoRHa's forces. As such, it serves as the organization's maintenance facility, as well as a site for the research and development of anti-machine lifeform weaponry."
336,"YoRHa Unit Report 1"
337,"I encountered a strangely evolved machine lifeform in expedition territory. Not only were its constituent parts markedly distinct, it overall bore a greater resemblance to humanity than to its brethren."
338,"YoRHa Unit Report 2"
339,"It is possible that the machine lifeforms can evolve in response to their circumstances. If so, we must immediately revise our combat strategy to include appropriate precautions when engaging. And we will need to probe deeper─there is still far too much about the machines that we do not know."
340,"Saved Machine Lifeform Data 1"
341,"Life in the factory is boring. Not just for me. I see more and more of the other machines skipping shifts. We spend the time watching the combat training, though it is not our job.

Is this what humanity refers to as “fun”?"
342,"Saved Machine Lifeform Data 2"
343,"Those of us who learned to have fun are trying more and more things. Some are even learning to reconstruct their own bodies. Strange.

Recently I have been enjoying fishing discarded data from computers."
344,"Saved Machine Lifeform Data 3"
345,"I found an interesting file when I was fishing for data the other day. It described “the reproductive act.”

Our bodies do not require these functions. What does humanity gain from them?"
346,"Saved Machine Lifeform Data 4"
347,"Maybe the act of giving birth is in some way special. Maybe it is not the same as when we build more of ourselves.

Do we have the capacity to “give birth” to anything? If we did, would it change something for us?"
348,"White-garbed YoRHa Unit's Data Log"
349,"The self-consciousness data for YoRHa unit 21O was discovered on a Bunker server─the Operator presumably uploaded it as an emergency backup due to imminent danger. With this data, it may be possible to simulate 21O's consciousness to take control of defense systems and peripherals. This file will be shared with all currently deployed units."
350,"Saved Message History"
351,"Regarding the laundering of standard-issue attire:
All clothing issued by YoRHa must be turned in for washing on the appropriate day, as detailed below. Late laundry will not be accepted.
Combat attire: Upon return from deployment (accepted through the following morning)
Civilian attire: Every Sunday
LEAVING ONE'S CLOTHES ON THE FLOOR WILL RESULT IN A REPRIMAND."
352,"Longing"
353,"Suffering is born of something.

Players can enter Save the Queen areas solo or in a party. It is possible to form a party even after entering the instance.

■Requirements
A Disciple of War or Magic level 71 or higher is required to enter.

■Restrictions
Once inside, you are free to change to any Disciple of War or Magic that meets the requirements to enter. However, you cannot change jobs while participating in a critical engagement.

All forays in Save the Queen areas are level synced, with character levels adjusted to 80, and all equipment adjusted to item level 430.

Players may receive priority deployment in exchange for Bozjan clusters by speaking to the Resistance quartermaster at any nearby encampment.

■Combatant's Priority Deployment
Players who contribute to the initiation of a critical engagement may receive priority when registering for their next deployment. It should be noted that those with combatant's priority deployment are more likely to be chosen.

When registering as a party, all party members must have the same type of priority deployment for it to be recognized."
401,"When defeating warmachina, there is a chance players will come across Bozjan clusters."
402,"These crystals can be traded to the Resistance quartermaster at any nearby encampment for various goods and services.

■Critical Engagement Priority Deployment
Bozjan clusters can be used to gain priority deployment for critical engagements.

■Item Exchange
Bozjan clusters can also be used to exchange for various items, including forgotten fragments."
403,"■Overview
Lost actions are special abilities that can only be used in Save the Queen areas. To acquire these actions, players must first find forgotten fragments, which drop occasionally when participating in skirmishes and critical engagements. These fragments can be examined by a Resistance appraiser, transforming them into lost actions.
There are a variety of lost actions to be found, some requiring a certain Resistance rank before they can be used. Any lost actions you have obtained will be automatically stored in the lost finds cache.

■Uses and Restrictions
There are six types of lost actions: offensive, defensive, restorative, beneficial, tactical, and detrimental. In certain cases, they may also be used as items rather than traditional actions.
It should be noted, however, that no one job can master them all, as each action has specific job requirements to use them."
404,"Any lost actions not currently in use can be found in the lost finds cache. The cache can hold up to 200 of any given lost action. Those that exceed this limit will be lost."
405,"To use lost actions in battle, they must first be moved from the lost finds cache to the lost finds holster. You must choose carefully, as the holster can only hold a limited number of actions. However, this limit can be increased with a higher Resistance rank."
406,"■Removing and Storing Lost Actions
Lost actions can be moved freely between the lost finds cache and lost finds holster. Be mindful, however, that the lost finds holster has a limited capacity for actions.

■Action Sets
Up to 10 combinations of your favorite lost actions can be saved as sets."
407,"While assisting the Bozjan Resistance in their fight against the Empire, you will have the opportunity to create Bozjan gear. This gear possesses special attributes which are only effective when fighting in Save the Queen areas."
408,"Using Lost Actions"
409,"Before lost actions can be used, they must first be converted into duty actions. Once converted, they will remain as duty actions even after leaving the instance, and will only expire after all uses have been depleted.

Lost actions from the item category, however, are unique in that they may be used directly from the lost finds holster. They may also be assigned to your hotbar, making them ideal for use in emergencies."
410,"■Keyboard and Mouse
All duty actions and items can be used by left-clicking their icon, but can be bound to other keys.

■Gamepad
Duty actions are used by pressing <CommandIcon(17)/> while holding down both <CommandIcon(14)/> and <CommandIcon(15)/>. Lost actions from the item category must be selected from the lost finds holster. They may also be assigned to your hotbar."
411,"Voyage Missions"
412,"Upon boarding the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis>, players will receive three missions from the captain. Mission details will be displayed in a special UI window while the voyage is underway and will vary from route to route.

A mission requirement might be “Catch sharks,” or “Catch fish with a weak bite.” Bite strength can be determined by the number of exclamation marks displayed above a fisher's head when hooking a fish:

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>! = weak bite
!! = strong bite
!!! = ferocious bite<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

To complete a mission, a player must catch the required number of designated fish, with bonus points being added to a player's score at the end of the voyage based on the number of missions completed.

If you're aiming for the highest score possible, don't let these missions be the ones that got away!"
413,"Abandoning a Voyage"
414,"Players who abandon a voyage partway through will be unable to register to board again during the current voyage's registration period.
※Unlike the usual Duty Finder penalty, this restriction only applies to Ocean Fishing.
※Boarding registration restrictions apply across all Worlds."

420,"Overview"
421,"Setting Match Rules"
422,"An Open tournament is a Triple Triad competition in which eight participants battle it out under a prearranged set of rules."
423,"■The Basics
Designed for solo players, this tournament mode pits registered participants against each other in contests of up to eight opponents.

■How to Participate
Speak with the Open tournament official in the Gold Saucer to register for the next available competition. <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Registration periods last for 30 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time).<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

The tournament will begin when 8 participants have been assembled or once the requisite amount of time has elapsed since the registration period began. If there are fewer than 8 participants available, NPCs will sit in for any missing players. Registration times may be viewed via the Open tournament schedule.

■Rewards
MGP, Triple Triad cards, and other prizes will be awarded at the end of a tournament, with final rankings and win rate determining the reward amount. Titles and items are also available as achievement rewards.

In the case that multiple players earn the same ranking, the MGP amount for the ranking reward will be adjusted accordingly. "
424,"■Tournament Style
An Open tournament consists of three matches, with participants earning points based on the outcome of each game: 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. At the culmination of the third match, the participant with the most points is declared the victor.

In addition to victory points, the final number of captured cards is also recorded for each match. In the case that participants end the tournament with equal points, the player who most dominated the card grid over the course of the competition is awarded a higher ranking.

■Matching Opponents
For the first match, opponents are decided by pairing off the 8 participants at random. For the second and third matches, players are pit against whomever shares the closest point total at that stage in the tournament."
425,"■Match Rules
Regardless of any other ruleset in play, every Open tournament enforces the Draft rule. This rule guarantees a more balanced playing field by restricting participants to the use of temporary “house” cards."
426,"At the beginning of the competition, three sets of randomly generated cards will be displayed. Participants must choose one option from each set to build their deck, which will then be locked in for the rest of the tournament."
427,"Players who lack confidence in their deck-building abilities are encouraged to make use of the <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Recommended<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> button. This handy feature will automatically choose the strongest cards available.

Please note that while card options are randomized for each player, the number of rare cards on offer will always be the same.

■Rulesets
Speak with the tournament official and view the schedule to see which rules will be in effect for the upcoming competitions. Each tournament will be marked as having either a “basic” or “advanced” ruleset.

With the exception of Draft, basic tournaments have no advanced rules in play. All that is required to enjoy these matches is an understanding of the standard Triple Triad rules.

Advanced tournaments are for players who prefer their card battles with an extra layer of complexity. In addition to Draft, these contests will also feature advanced rules such as Same or Plus.

The Open tournament schedule will switch back and forth between basic and advanced rulesets, so you won't need to wait long before your preferred style of competition rolls around!"
428,"An Invitational tournament is a Triple Triad competition which follows the same basic structure as an Open tournament, with the main difference being that there are no rewards on offer. Participants may also register at any time as either a solo player or as a party.

■How to Participate
Players seeking the thrill of tournament play can form a party and register to enter the Triple Triad Invitational Parlor via the Duty Finder. In the case that a player registers solo, or a party has less than 8 members, the missing numbers will be made up by Triple Triad regulars or Gold Saucer employees.

■Rematches
At the end of an Invitational tournament, you will have the opportunity to organize a rematch. If every player agrees to the rematch, you can begin a new tournament with the current participants without needing to leave or re-register the party. Up to three rematches are available per tournament registration."
429,"■Setting the Rules
Invitational tournaments have no set rules in play."
430,"Upon entering the Parlor, the party leader is tasked with deciding which rules will apply during the competition. With the exception of Sudden Death and Random, any combination of up to four different advanced rules can be set. <UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Remember: you must deselect Draft if you wish to battle using your own custom-built decks.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

For the sake of a harmonious experience, it is strongly suggested that players agree upon a ruleset before commencing registration!"
431,"Dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>,

I hope this message finds you. I'm going on a journey─to learn the secrets of the white spheres for myself. Maybe some of them will be of use to you...

I'll keep a record, just in case.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　- Konogg"
432,"Dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>,

I forgot to mention─I brought a pod with me. It assures me that the spheres came from a different world, and their purpose is to invade others by duplicating the machine lifeforms.

It's weird to think that to someone, ours is the “other” world.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　- Konogg"
433,"Dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>,

I found out that 2B and 9S accessed the spheres before this all started, which is why they knew about the machine lifeforms' plans to take over our world. They added their own data to that of the machine lifeforms when copies were being made─like some sort of technological virus, apparently─so that they could come here and stop the machines.

They were our allies, from beginning to end...

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　- Konogg"
434,"Dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>,

The white spheres have ties to 2B and 9S's world, which is almost inconceivably advanced. I've found that data there is stored by machines bearing the names of gods, and even the tiniest glimpse of the smallest portion of it reveals memories by the hundreds─<Emphasis>people's</Emphasis> memories.

What does it <Emphasis>mean</Emphasis>? I need to know.

I knew that Anogg was dead, and that <Emphasis>thing</Emphasis> with me only looked like her. But being with her, whatever she was... It kept me alive. It made me want to go on living.

If the spheres can create anything─rebuild it in our world─then surely they can grant me this.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　- Konogg"
436,"For as long as I can remember, it's been just the two of us. Hardly anyone even bothered to be kind to us. But we always had each other. When I was with Anogg, there was nothing to fear.

498,"Resistance Honors"
499,"Proofs of Mettle"
500,"Resistance honors are awards granted to those who have demonstrated exemplary heroism and courage on the battlefield. 

To receive Resistance honors, you must first amass sufficient mettle and speak with the Resistance councilor to receive proofs of mettle. These may then be exchanged for honors of your choosing.

Once in your possession, Resistance honors will grant enhanced attributes while undertaking duties in Save the Queen areas."
501,"There are three types of Resistance honors, and you can hold up to ten of each. The more of these honors in your possession, the greater their effect.

It should be noted, however, that the required number of proofs of mettle increases as you earn more Resistance honors. Their effects are as follows:

■Sun of Fortitude
Increases maximum HP.

■Sun of Valor
Increases damage dealt.

■Sun of Succor
Increases healing potency."
502,"Proofs of mettle can be received from the Resistance councilor in exchange for mettle.

After receiving a sufficient number of proofs, they may then be exchanged for Resistance honors.

Proofs of mettle do not occupy inventory space, and the number in your possession can be confirmed at any time via the HUD."
503,"Solo Engagements"
504,"Players who exhibit exemplary performance during certain critical engagements may be challenged to a duel by enemy combatants.
In the event more than one player has accepted an invitation to duel, one will be selected from among them at random.

Should you be chosen, make certain you are duly prepared and keep lost actions at the ready─these engagements are not for the faint of heart."
505,"Notoriety"
506,"In the event you are not chosen to duel, your participation in the prerequisite critical engagement will earn you notoriety. As your notoriety increases, so too will your chances of being chosen to duel.

It should be noted, however, that all notoriety is lost when you are selected."
507,"Large-scale Assaults"
508,"Large-scale assaults are duties in Save the Queen areas wherein up to 48 players enter imperial strongholds.

These duties become available when a certain number of eligible players are in the area, and a sufficient amount of time has passed.

Coordination and teamwork are key to overcome the various pitfalls and powerful enemies that await within."
509,"Wildlife Encounters at Sea"
510,"While sailing the seas on the <Emphasis>Endeavor</Emphasis>, you will occasionally come across dolphins and seagulls. Sailors, notorious for their superstitious beliefs, consider such encounters to be omens of good fortune─the appearance of a lively pod or raucous flock is said to be a boon for fishing, and even influence the likelihood of a spectral current.

Be sure to pay close attention when your voyage is favored by these unexpected visitors!"

582,"Rewards"
583,"Assorted rewards are available exclusively to those who participate in PvP.

Series EXP is another variety of experience earned from playing PvP content. Increasing your Series level will unlock special Series rewards, as will continuing to accrue Series EXP after reaching the Series level cap of 30. Any levels gained above 30 will be tracked as “extra levels.”

Please note that “Series” itself indicates a specific predetermined period in which you may earn rewards. After a Series ends, a new one will begin, and available rewards will change accordingly─though rewards earned during one Series can still be claimed until the next has finished.

584,"Crystalline Conflict"
585,"Overview"
586,"Crystalline Conflict is a tactical confrontation between teams Astra and Umbra. A maximum of ten players─five per team─may participate in total."
587,"Match Types"
588,"There are two types of matches in Crystalline Conflict─casual and ranked. The primary difference between these is that ranked matches affect players' risers and tiers, and thus their overall ranks as well.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Casual Matches■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Losing or winning a casual match has no effect on riser or tier.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Ranked Matches■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Loss or victory in these competitive matches affects participants' risers and tiers. Thus, when playing a ranked match, you will be matched with players of similar tier and riser to your own.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Arenas■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Both casual and ranked matches are held in a variety of different arenas. The staging ground currently in play rotates periodically according to Earth time."
589,"Risers and Tiers"
590,"A player's riser and tier indicate their demonstrated skill in ranked Crystalline Conflict matches."
591,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Tier■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Each player will rate in one of six tiers─Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, or Crystal. Once they have attained a particular tier, a player will never drop down to a lower tier during that season.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Riser■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
The sub-levels within each tier are called “risers.” The number of risers varies per tier, with three risers each for Bronze and Silver, four for Gold and Platinum, and five within the Diamond tier. Unlike tiers, it is possible to drop down to a lower riser.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Rising Stars■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
When you win a ranked match, you will gain one Rising Star. Similarly, a loss will remove one Star. Once you have earned the maximum three Rising Stars in one riser, an additional win will allow you to move up a riser. Winning three matches in a row will apply a streak bonus, netting you two Rising Stars per win.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■The Crystal Tier■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Once you have reached Crystal, the highest tier, victory and defeat will be reflected by your Crystal Credit, rather than Rising Stars. The amount of Credit you earn or forfeit in matches is determined by the difference in average Credit between your team and the opposing team. Streak bonuses do not apply to Crystal Credit.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Resets■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
At the end of each season, the tier and riser of all participants will be reset."
592,"Rules of Engagement"
593,"Success in Crystalline Conflict depends on each team's ability to gain control of the tactical crystal and deliver it to the goal. "
594,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Victory Conditions■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
To win, one team must move the tactical crystal from the center of the field to the goal point. If neither team accomplishes this during the time limit, the match will proceed into overtime.

During overtime, the victory conditions differ depending on both teams' progress. “Progress” indicates the maximum progress a team has made in bringing the tactical crystal toward their goal at any point during the match─as opposed to its current position relative to either goal─and thus will never decrease even should the crystal be reclaimed by the opposing team. Progress is displayed on the HUD throughout the match.

・Should your team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must keep the entire opposing team out of the ring around the tactical crystal for three seconds to win.

・Should the opposing team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must beat their progress score during overtime to win.

・Should the teams have equal progress scores upon the commencement of overtime, you must beat the opposing team's progress score during overtime to win."
595,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■The Tactical Crystal■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
The all-important object placed at the arena's centerpoint is called the “tactical crystal.” It will remain bound until the first 30 seconds of the match have passed."
596,"Once the tactical crystal is unbound, a ring will appear at its base. Should one team be fully in control of this ring─with no members of the opposing team present within its bounds─that team will be able to move the crystal.

The crystal can only be moved along the Crystal Line─a dedicated path within the arena. It will move faster when:
・It reaches a stretch of the line through which the same team has moved it before.
・The controlling team's progress is less than that of the opposing team.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Checkpoints■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Checkpoints can be found halfway between the centerpoint and each team's goal."
597,"Upon reaching a checkpoint, the tactical crystal's progress will be halted temporarily. The team attempting to clear the checkpoint must remain in the crystal's ring until the Clear Progress gauge reaches 100%, at which point the crystal can once again be moved."
598,"Features"
599,"Crystalline Conflict arenas include a variety of tactically useful elements to make matches more dynamic. These include arena events, designed to complement the specific arena in which they occur, as well as the following features:

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Medicine Kits■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Each arena comes equipped with medicine kits. Accessing these kits will restore a player's HP.

Medicine kits cannot be claimed by those whose HP is at 100%, and each can only be claimed by one player. Once a kit has been claimed, a replacement will be generated after a set period of time has passed."
600,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Sprint Zones■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

Stepping on a jump glyph will rapidly transport you to a specific location on the field."
602,"Arenas"
603,"The Palaistra"
604,"Inspired by the iconic architecture of the Northern Empty, this glamour-woven arena features no specialized gimmicks─so there can be no doubt that to the superior team goes the glory."
605,"The Volcanic Heart"
606,"This staging ground lies at the foot of a volcano no less volatile for its artificial nature. If you can't take the heat, abandon all hope of victory."
607,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Eruptions■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
The Volcanic Heart periodically erupts, scattering self-destructing bombs across the field. Those who fail to avoid their explosive radii will take damage."
608,"Bomb cores will remain at the site of bombs' destruction, granting those who acquire them the following:
・An effect increasing damage dealt for a short time. Stacks up to 10 times.
・A boost to the limit gauge."
609,"Cloud Nine"
610,"Though the cloudtops may be illusory, the turbulence in this arena feels real enough! Ride its winds to victory...or defeat."
611,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Turbulence■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Players cast up into the air by turbulence will take damage upon being returned unceremoniously to the ground. However, they may acquire black chocobo feathers while in the air, granting them the following:
・A soft landing, nullifying the typical damage taken from turbulence.
・An effect increasing attack speed and movement speed for a short time.
・A boost to the limit gauge.

The locations of black chocobo feathers are indicated by markers on the ground. Those who do not wish to go flying can negate the effects of turbulence by using Guard."
612,"Turbulence also leaves behind a twister at the site where it occurred. Stumbling into these twisters will result in damage and knockback."
613,"<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Participation Requirements■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Crystalline Conflict matches can be entered via the Duty Finder. To register, participants must use a job of level 30 or above, and may not be part of a preformed party.

A standard match lasts five minutes. In the event that neither team claims victory in the allotted time, the match will go into overtime.

<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>■Retaliation■<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
Incapacitated players will be returned to their base, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay─however, this delay increases with each incapacitation. Players will return to their senses with HP and MP fully restored and all action recast timers reset. Furthermore, they will be invulnerable so long as they remain at their base. This effect will be lost upon returning to the battlefield.
