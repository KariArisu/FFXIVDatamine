Movamuq is searching for a strangeface to Earthenshire."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_SEQ_01","Movamuq has received an unusual request from her potsworn: to recruit a stranger to Earthenshire to fulfill some undisclosed task. She bids you speak with Anfroy, the artisan in question, to learn more of his plans.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_SEQ_02","For reasons yet to be made clear, Anfroy tasks you with learning all you can about the tastes of his Moblin caretaker. He suggests speaking with her fellow Moblins, hopeful they can shed light on what it is she holds dear."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_SEQ_03","You make your inquiries among the Earthenshire folk, and discover a few tidbits about Movamuq's personal preferences. Chief among these revelations is the fact that she likes Anfroy and his works, and dislikes anything that impedes either."
4,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_SEQ_04","You divulge all to Anfroy, who divulges his own truth in turn: that he means to make a gift for Movamuq, to thank her for her long years of loyal service. Among the findings from your fact-finding mission, he believes he has discovered some hint as to what kind of present might please her most. Unable to call upon Movamuq's help in its crafting, he must continue to rely on yours."

49,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_MOVAMUQ_000_001","The matter is this: Movamuq's crafthand is to retire after longyears. He lipslips that he intends to fancycraft one last masterpiece before he does so, but for this, he needs the handhelp of a strangeface to the village."
50,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_MOVAMUQ_000_002","Anfroy is his name. He is always very murkyworded with his requests, so Movamuq is not sure what handhelp he needs, but if you could exchange tongueflaps with him, she would be very, very happyfeels."

52,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_010","Yes, I'm Anfroy. Do I know─ ...Wait, aren't you the friend of the Third Promise? The adventurer from across the salt who was asking about the potpacts?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_011","Ah, I <Emphasis>see</Emphasis>! Movamuq sent you. I only said I needed the help of a stranger to Earthenshire─trust her to pick an honest-to-goodness hero!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_012","The task I have for you is but a trifling one, but it's very near and dear to my heart: I want you to find out all you can about Movamuq."
55,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_013","There's nothing untoward about it, I assure you. I'm interested in what <Emphasis>she's</Emphasis> interested in. Her hobbies, her likes and dislikes, what she holds dear, and so forth. But for certain reasons that I'll share with you later, she can't know this."
56,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_014","We've been working together for decades, but now, as my potpact is about to end, I find that I know next to nothing about her...but perhaps others who work closely with the Moblins might!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_015","Remember: don't tell anyone that I'm the one who's trying to learn more about Movamuq. I can't risk her finding out before...well, I'll tell you about that later."
58,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_DOLEDRIQ_000_030","Pfffkohhh...? Uplander wants to know what braintickles Movamuq? That's an easyask! Movamuq never lipflaps about anything other than her potsworn, Anfroy. She says he is just as good a tricksycrafter as he is a craftytricker─always playing crafty tricks!"
59,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_DOLEDRIQ_000_031","One day, Anfroy draws little arrows around the village, showing potsworn how to leave Earthenshire without helphands eyecatching them."
60,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_DOLEDRIQ_000_032","Many laughminded potfriends follow the arrows and leave for secret hideyplace in the woods! Mobbies are frightyfeels over disappearing potsworn!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_DOLEDRIQ_000_033","Potsworn come back all glitterteeth, but helphands are steamears. All except Movamuq. She goes around the village, saying guiltwords to everymobbie for Anfroy's sneakytrick. Deepheart, though, it is clear that she is nothing but happyfeels to have him back."
62,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_QOBLI_000_040","Movamuq and Anfroy? Yes, I know the pair well. She's famously very protective of him, sometimes even rejecting his patrons' orders outright."
63,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_QOBLI_000_041","It's not that she thinks him unequal to the tasks, you understand. Quite the opposite, in fact: she knows how exacting his standards are, and how discontented he would be if his work failed to meet them."
64,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_QOBLI_000_042","So any time a patron attempts to have him lower his standards, or design something differently to how he judges best, Movamuq will always leap to his defense."
65,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_QOBLI_000_043","As for what she enjoys, well...her delight in Anfroy's creations has not dulled at all in all the years they've worked together. I should think she likes nothing more."
66,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_TARNOTIK_000_050","What does Movamuq value most? Her potsworn, of course! Anymobbie who says otherwise is a fibspeaker!"
67,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_TARNOTIK_000_051","She keeps the treasure he gave her heartside at all times...or so she once lipslipped to Tarnotik."
68,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_TARNOTIK_000_052","He hasn't a flimsythought what this treasure might be, but whatever it is, it's sureproof of the friendbond between them!"
69,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_DOLEDRIQ_000_060","Movamuq is a model helphand. Even when everymobbie was angry with Anfroy for his craftytrick, she bore the guiltweight─and she bore it smileywise."
70,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_QOBLI_000_065","Yes, I can't think of anything that Movamuq holds more precious than Anfroy and his creations."

72,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_100","Ah, you're back. So, what did you find out?"
73,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_101","...Ha! She really thinks that much of me? They say that Moblin helphands love nothing more than helping their charges, and it seems it's true...though it wouldn't hurt for her to show it a little more often."
74,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_102","But that's not the only thing you learned, and I thank you for it. You've given me exactly what I need...so I suppose it's about time I told you what I need it for. The truth is─"
75,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_MOVAMUQ_000_103","Pfff... Pfffkohhh... Is <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> still hard at handhelping?"
76,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_104","Yes, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> is─so I'll thank you for not bothering us. You do remember that I <Emphasis>specifically</Emphasis> asked you to leave me be until my work was complete?"
77,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_MOVAMUQ_000_105","Always such angrywords... Movamuq means no bother. Just needs to do daily mobduty─sharpening tools until they sparkleshine."
78,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_106","And I'm telling you that I don't need you to. Not now, anyway. I'm almost retired. All my commissions are already dealt with."
79,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_MOVAMUQ_000_107","Until the endday of the potpact, Movamuq will uphold her pactpart! It is her duty as helphand!"
80,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_108","Why do you <Emphasis>always</Emphasis> have to be so..."
81,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_109","I'm sorry, Movamuq, but I'm going to have to put my foot down. I expressly forbid you from touching my tools until my work with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> is finished."
82,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_MOVAMUQ_000_110","Then Movamuq will do as Anfroy asks, though it makes her shamefaced. She will handturn to other duties. If Anfroy needs her, he has only to hailcall."
83,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_111","I wish I didn't have to do that, but I'll be needing every one of those tools if I'm to achieve my aim."
84,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_112","That aim being: to make a farewell present for Movamuq!"
85,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_113","In all the years I've been working here, she's been my guardian angel, answering my every prayer before it even makes it to my lips. Even in these recent times, when the helphands have grown too few for the number of potsworn, her service hasn't lapsed an ilm."
86,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_114","Now that my service is coming to an end, I wanted to do something just for her, to thank her for everything she's done for me. Yet despite her knowing me better than I do myself, I discovered that I didn't really know anything about her at all."
87,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_115","I tried to speak with her─to learn what really makes her tick─but she always brushed me off. Said that her only wish as a “humble helphand” was to see <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> wishes realized."
88,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_116","That got me thinking─perhaps she and the other Moblins might be more willing to open up to someone who <Emphasis>wasn't</Emphasis> bound by the potpact. Someone like you. And by all the gods, the plan worked!"
89,"TEXT_KINGZC301_05085_ANFROY_000_117","I have an idea for her present now. All that remains is to craft it...but without Movamuq's help, that might be a little more difficult than usual. If you'd be willing to play helphand a little longer, I'd make it worth your while!"
