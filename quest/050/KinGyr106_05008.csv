49,"TEXT_KINGYR106_05008_RHODINA_000_001","You needn't fuss yourself over the details─the arrangement is blissfully simple. You provide me with product, and I compensate you for said product with scrips. A <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> of your expertise must surely recognize such a lucrative offer when they hear one."
