49,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_CAPTAIN05022_000_002","Alas, exposed as it is to the elements, it requires a lot of upkeep, which is where we of the fife and drum corps come in. Speaking of which...what's taking him so long?"
50,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_CAPTAIN05022_000_003","Say, you strike me as the dependable sort. Might I trouble you to find our new recruit? He was tasked with handling today's inspection."
51,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_CAPTAIN05022_000_004","Given how long it's taking him, it's possible he ran into trouble, but I'm supposed to be supervising things here. Check behind the tower and you should find him."
52,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_CAPTAIN05022_000_005","My subordinate should be on the south side of the tower. Hopefully he hasn't run into any trouble."
53,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_JUNIOR05022_000_010","Er, can I help you? Wait─the <Emphasis>drum major</Emphasis> sent you!? Gods be good, I've wasted too much time!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_JUNIOR05022_000_011","I've already finished checking the drum and the tower, mind you. But I just had to go and drop my tools, and now I can't find them!"
55,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_JUNIOR05022_000_012","Will you help me look? I could really use a second pair of eyes right now!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_JUNIOR05022_000_013","Please, won't you help me look for my drum inspection kit? It must be around here somewhere!"

58,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_JUNIOR05022_000_030","Oh, I'm so glad you found them! You're a lifesaver, truly. If I dared to report back without them, the major would have grilled me to a fine char."
59,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_JUNIOR05022_000_031","With that settled, I really must return to my other duties. I'd be most grateful if you could inform the major on my behalf!"
60,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_CAPTAIN05022_000_040","There you are. I'm told you helped our recruit find the inspection kit after he dropped it. Your generosity means more to our community than you might realize."
61,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_CAPTAIN05022_000_041","This drum is essential for the protection and well-being of our people. It not only marks the time of day, but also honors the Landsguard returning home from duty. And in times of crisis, it can be used to warn the populace of danger."
62,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_CAPTAIN05022_000_042","That is why we must keep it in pristine condition at all times. But of course, our most common duty as the fife and drum corps is to perform as a musical ensemble!"
63,"TEXT_KINGZA006_05022_CAPTAIN05022_000_043","It takes tremendous upper arm strength to beat a drum of this scale, and as major, my job is to pound our greenest recruits into shape. Perhaps I've been slacking... Before I forget, take this. You've earned it."
