50,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_003","As if ending Valigarmanda's rampage wasn't impressive enough, you saved the city from those mechanical beggars, too. If there were ever any doubts about your abilities, they're well and truly answered. "
51,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_004","Which is why I'd like to ask your aid one last time. Will you join us in our most essential duty─seeking out and slaying those fiends most foul? Those that pose the gravest dangers to our people?"
52,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_005","You're a hero through and through. Hunting down marks like these is the very purpose the vipers were founded for."
53,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_006","And it's no easy task, I can tell you. There are horrors out there. True horrors. Tural vidraal like Valigarmanda. Creatures more akin to gods than beasts."
54,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_007","We vipers wander far and wide across the land that we might learn of these creatures, and one day, end them. You remember Ty'at Qat? She's been doing just that for decades now, and has come away with a long list of targets. If you're interested in finding out more about them, go and see her in Yak T'el."
55,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_008","Napikwe was doing the same when she went to Yyasulani...and yet there's nothing you could call a tural vidraal in her journal. Strange, I thought, when they've shown up nigh everywhere else. Makes me wonder if she mightn't've left them out on purpose."
56,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_009","Napikwe's a viper to the quick, you see. Nothing matters to her more than the people's safety. Separated from her fellow vipers as she was, perhaps she thought it best to leave such nightmares well alone."

58,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_011","Oh, and tell her one more thing, from me: that if she wants to come back, me and the rest of the vipers stand ready to welcome her with open arms."
59,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_012","Napikwe's been fighting for the people inside that dome for decades. The vipers are proud to call her our sister─and if she wants to come home, we'll give her the welcome of a lifetime."

70,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_RINURI_000_030","After you brought peace to Living Memory, our team secured what we could from the data banks. Found a fair few things that brought a glint to Lady Napikwe's eye, I can tell you."
71,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_NAPIKWE_000_031","<Emphasis>Tural vidraal</Emphasis>, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Bol Ogaw knew it. It doesn't do to draw too much attention to those fiends you haven't the strength to slay. From what Rinuri tells me of your achievements, though, I shouldn't wonder if you and yours could succeed where we could not."
72,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_NAPIKWE_000_032","Queen Sphene charged me with chronicling her kingdom's fauna, and I expect there are many discoveries still to be made in its darkest corners. If you want to learn more, just ask these two."

77,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_036","...I see. It's good to know she has friends. I couldn't bear to think of her all alone up there."
78,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_037","“A viper lives to hunt, that others might live to hunt another day,” or so the saying goes. Sounds like she's taken that message to heart. Taken it upon herself to train a new generation..."
79,"TEXT_KINGYR204_05012_BOLOGAW_000_038","And it looks like you're her latest pupil! May luck be with you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─and remember: whatever you do, don't get yourself killed."
