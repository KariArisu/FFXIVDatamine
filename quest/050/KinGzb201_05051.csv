Nopli is rubbing his hands together."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_SEQ_01","The enthusiastic merchant, Nopli, attempts to sell you what he believes to be rare and otherwise valuable corrupted crystals, only for you to inform him that they are, in fact, neither. He is both shocked by the revelation and dismayed at the untold sums of pel he squandered in their purchase. Though the peddler is naive, he is not one to be deterred, and so he begs your assistance in his pursuit to discover some modicum of worth in the crystals.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_SEQ_02","You agree to lend Nopli your aid, and he quickly tasks you with speaking with a mage of the Boonewa tribe in Wachunpelo, who are said to use crystals in their rituals."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_SEQ_03","You manage to locate the mage. Unfortunately, he has no interest in purchasing the crystals."
4,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_SEQ_04","You inform Nopli that, much as you expected, there is not a soul in Wachunpelo interested in purchasing corrupted crystals. Initially dismayed by the news, Nopli soon channels his sadness into anger towards the merchant who lied to him, vowing to stop the so-called pernicious peddler from swindling anyone else. To contend with such a cunning adversary, Nopli will undoubtedly need your continued assistance."

49,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_001","The name's Nopli, and I'll have you know I'm a merchant blessed by fortune─if I do say so myself."
50,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_002","Indeed, I believe our meeting today is no chance encounter, but the hands of fate guiding us for one singular purpose: the exchange of invaluable items at an unbelievable price! If I could direct your attention over here for just a moment..."
51,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_003","Feast your eyes on these! Crates of exceedingly rare and precious corrupted crystals!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_004","Beautiful, aren't they? They were extracted from remote regions of Eorzea, and shine a brilliant orange hue─quite unlike your run-of-the-mill crystals, no?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_005","For you, I'm willing to offer them for the low, low price of one pel...in the millions column! It's nigh highway robbery at this valuation, but anything for a friend of the Third Promise!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
55,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_A1_000_001","Sorry, I clearly misheard you. It almost sounded like you said “one million.”"
56,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_A1_000_002","They're not worth even a fraction of that price."
57,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_A1_000_003","Well for such a <Emphasis>low</Emphasis> price, I'd be a fool to refuse!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_006","What do you mean? Considering how much it set me back to purchase them, the price I'm offering should be perfectly reasonable. Strange. These are precious crystals, are they not?"
59,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_007","You say that, but I don't see you reaching for your coinpurse... Strange. Considering how much it set me back to purchase them, the price I'm offering should be perfectly reasonable..."
60,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_008","J-Just to be certain, these crystals <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> considered priceless treasures in Eorzea, right?"
61,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_009","Let me see if I'm getting this right: not only are corrupted crystals commonplace across the salt, but they're also highly volatile."
62,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_010","And in the past, you once used such crystals together with an “elemental converter” to do battle with powerful entities you call “primals.”"
63,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_011","What's more, you kept them in a warded container at all times to protect against their deleterious effects."
64,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_012","All of which is to say, no <Emphasis>practical</Emphasis> use for such crystals has been discovered, meaning no one with sense would ever bother to mine them..."
65,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_013","The peddler who sold the crystals to me never mentioned a word of this. He claimed they're extremely rare in Eorzea, which is why I decided to purchase them in the first place, even at the exorbitant price he offered."
66,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_014","Naturally, I believed him. Having never seen crystals of their like, could you blame me? But if they really have no use..."
67,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_015","Have I, Nopli the Lucky, been...swindled?"
68,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_016","W-Well, at the very least, I was able to learn about the crystals' true nature before selling them to some poor soul. Fortune hasn't abandoned me completely yet!"
69,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_017","At any rate, I'd like to verify whether these crystals truly hold no value."
70,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_018","Would you be willing to help me look into this, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? I need someone I can trust, and that you'd be willing to share the truth with me says a lot."
71,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_019","No need to answer right away─give it some thought. If you've no interest, you're free to be on your way. If you decide to assist me, however, I'll be here waiting!"
72,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_030","You're willing to help, then? Wonderful! You truly are a kind-hearted soul!"
73,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_031","Now, before I go and confront the merchant who sold me these crystals, I'd like to look into potential uses for them in Tural."
74,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_032","For instance, crystals are in high demand among Turali mages, who make extensive use of them in their rituals."
75,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_033","And I just so happen to know a spellcaster among the distillery's guard. I'd like you to speak with them about the corrupted crystals, and gauge their interest in purchasing them."
76,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_034","In the meantime, I will see about procuring a container to ward off the crystals' harmful effects. Per your explanation, preparing an elemental converter with my skills is likely impossible─but finding the requisite materials for a warding vessel should be well within my abilities."
77,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_035","The mage you're looking for is an individual of the Boonewa tribe. If you happen upon someone wielding a staff, chances are you've found them."
78,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_036","Remember, look for an individual of the Boonewa tribe holding a staff! I wish to know if the corrupted crystals garner their interest."
79,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_BOONEWAMAGE05051_000_040","Intriguing. I've never heard of these corrupted crystals. As a practitioner of the arcane arts, I'll not deny they pique my curiosity..."
80,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_BOONEWAMAGE05051_000_041","But I'm afraid I have no interest in purchasing them. If they're as volatile as you say, there is little to be done with crystals whose very nature can change on a whim."
81,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_HOOBIGOFIGHTER05051_000_042","Huh? I don't know the first thing about crystals. I'm not an artisan, nor a mage."
82,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_XBRAALFIGHTER05051_000_043","Unusual crystals? Not interested. I prefer to keep my distance from peculiarities. "
83,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_BOONEWAMAGE05051_000_044","I've no interest in purchasing the corrupted crystals. If they are so unstable they must be kept inside a special container, how could I possibly assure my own safety when using them?"
84,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_HOOBIGOFIGHTER05051_000_045","I don't know the first thing about crystals. Try asking a mage."
85,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_XBRAALFIGHTER05051_000_046","I told you, I'm not interested. Your time would be better spent asking someone who <Emphasis>is</Emphasis>."
86,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_050","<sigh> So even the mage was not interested... Nevertheless, I thank you for speaking with them on my behalf."
87,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_051","It seems you were right. These crystals really are worthless..."
88,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_052","I may be unable to make back what I've lost, but there's still one thing I can do!"
89,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_053","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I wish to stop that pernicious peddler from continuing his crooked ways. Will you help me?"
90,"TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_NOPLI_000_054","What a relief! Allow me to offer you a small token of my thanks. When you have a moment to spare, please come see me again. We must stop him before he has a chance to swindle anyone else!"
