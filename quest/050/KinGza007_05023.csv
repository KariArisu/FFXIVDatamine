51,"TEXT_KINGZA007_05023_PERUPERU05023_000_004","The first has deep blue and yellow walls, with feather decorations that hang from the eaves. The man who lives there is a very eloquent Hanuhanu."
52,"TEXT_KINGZA007_05023_PERUPERU05023_000_005","The second is home to a rather voracious Moblin. You're looking for sky blue walls with a yellow roof, a storehouse, and decorative vases out front."

54,"TEXT_KINGZA007_05023_HANUHANU05023_000_010","Dear me, you mean to say my package has arrived? I had some dried reeds imported from Ok'hanu, you see. Ordered them as soon as I heard the crops had recovered."
