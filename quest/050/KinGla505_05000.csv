1,"TEXT_KINGLA505_05000_SEQ_01","Having thoroughly digested his most recent fish, Pashenine sets out to challenge his rite of passage. He must face his trials alone, but he would like you and Donuhanu to join him at his final stop in Uyuyub' so he can show you the results in person."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA505_05000_SEQ_02","You and Donuhanu arrive ahead of Pashenine, but he soon appears bearing gargantuan corpses, all slain by the power of phantasmic fish. Donuhanu presumes celebrations are in order, but Pashenine reveals that his most difficult challenge still lies ahead. He must slay a carnivorous tree, more lethal than all three defeated marks combined. His budding confidence is shaken in the face of this formidable foe, but Donuhanu is not willing to let the Whalaqee's journey end just yet. For every enemy, there is a fish that might defeat it, and the Hanuhanu seems certain that the cenotes of the Ja Tiika Heartland are home to the deadly fish that Pashenine needs. Donuhanu dashes off to catch it himself, which is by any standards, a dangerous lapse in judgment. You hurry to Yak T'el to fish your feathered friend out of trouble."
3,"TEXT_KINGLA505_05000_SEQ_03","Perhaps predictably, Donuhanu has injured himself in his ill-advised fishing endeavor. It is up to you to fish out the shark that has been terrorizing the waters of Bitterbark Cenote, and deliver it to the wheezing fishmonger."
4,"TEXT_KINGLA505_05000_SEQ_04","In a display of peerless fishing prowess, you snag the cenote shark and haul it to dry land. Donuhanu praises your skill before realizing that the comfort of his own shop is preferable to the wild outdoors, so it's back to the Fancies you go."
5,"TEXT_KINGLA505_05000_SEQ_05","Happily settled back at the Fancies, Donuhanu explains the strengths of the cenote shark you so deftly reeled in. Pashenine, however, has something else on his mind. He asks the Hanuhanu fishmonger why he has risked wit and wing to help realize the dream of a fledgling mage. Feathers ruffling in embarrassment, Donuhanu explains that Pashenine's arrival caused him to rethink his attitude towards his favorite fish. By gaining a thorough understanding of their qualities, he might yet prevail upon others to see their value, and thus make Fish Fancies Donuhanu a place to honor all odd fish. While both your friends have dreams to work toward, the path is still long─and you will be with them the entire way, fishing pole at the ready..."
