48,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_000","Ah, the hero who brought low Valigarmanda. I would beg your aid in exterminating a new threat that has visited the Yok Huy."
49,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_001","One of our kin recently went missing, only to turn up just outside the ruins at the Shades of Grief...reduced to a desiccated corpse."
50,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_003","Judging from the wounds, the poor soul must have been fed upon by a particularly formidable bloodsucker. This fiend cannot be suffered to live!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_004","To lure it out, we have placed blood-soaked meat at strategic locations around the ruins. One of my comrades is there now, and he'd doubtless be grateful for your assistance."
52,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_005","You'll find the Shades of Grief down the road to the northwest. Would you meet with my comrade and check on the trap we've laid?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_FAKEYOKFUY05049_000_010","Gee hee hee... Ahem! Greetings, visitor!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_FAKEYOKFUY05049_000_011","You know the plan, yes? Well, there's a problem. Some <Emphasis>other</Emphasis> creatures have been drawn in by the smell of the meat, oh yes!"
55,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_FAKEYOKFUY05049_000_012","Yes, that despicable bloodsucker will never creep out from hiding so long as they're around! Yes, I'm afraid I must ask you to get rid of them!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_FAKEYOKFUY05049_000_013","Luckily, there is nothing our quarry loves better than fresh blood. The more of it, the better, oh yes!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_FAKEYOKFUY05049_000_014","I'll watch from a distance, yes? Once the creatures have been dealt with, come to the west side of the ruins. Hee hee...kee hee hee!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_FAKEYOKFUY05049_000_020","Gee hee hee! Finally. You must be so exhausted after all that dashing and slashing. As for me, I feel rather invigorated, oh yes!"
59,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_FAKEYOKFUY05049_000_021","Why, I was practically counting the seconds...until I could drain your life's blood!"
60,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_POPMESSAGE_000_025","The enemy reveals itself!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_030","The bloodsucker was disguised as my comrade all along!? Surely that cannot be!"
62,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_031","F-Forgive me, I know not what to say. If the fiend was possessed of such an alarming ability, I should think someone would have made mention of it before now!"
63,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_032","Years ago, the Head of Reason once speculated that the beasts we call bloodsuckers are in fact beings known as “voidsent,” come from another realm."
64,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_033","Others have even suggested they might be invaders from distant stars! I have heard many and more theories over the years, but perhaps I was unwise to shrug them off as I have."
65,"TEXT_KINGZB109_05049_DABARGAR_000_034","In any case, the threat is no more, and our village owes you a debt. Now, if you will excuse me, I must find my missing comrade! "
