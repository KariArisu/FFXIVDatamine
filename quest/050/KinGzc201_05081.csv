Lanuhanu needs help performing an honored tradition."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_SEQ_01","Lanuhanu, one of the Wind's Chosen, has picked you to participate in a customary gifting of feathers to the Landsguard. What this entails is uncertain, but the Hanuhanu asks you to search nearby roads for Nahanshe, a Landsguard soldier who seems to be running late to take part in this sacred custom.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_SEQ_02","After a quick search of the road, you find Nahanshe. The soldier is quite unenthusiastic about this duty, but resigns himself to visit Ok'hanu, where Lanuhanu awaits."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_SEQ_03","Enthused to greet this new visitor, Lanuhanu declares that before the feathers are to be passed on, he is obligated to give the Landsguard a tour of Ok'hanu. Follow him to the center of the village and take in all its beauty."
4,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_SEQ_04","As you gaze down on Ok'hanu, Lanuhanu explains that the gift of feathers is used to adorn the Landsguard equipment, and that your next task is to dye and oil the feathers. Nahanshe reluctantly agrees to this before leaving. Your Hanuhanu host stops you to explain the true intention behind this work: to temper the rough personalities of new recruits into shining beacons of courage. With this new knowledge in hand, you are to head to the southeastern gate to meet Nahanshe."
5,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_SEQ_05","As you arrive at the southeastern gate, Nahanshe greets you with characteristic lassitude. Although his attitude leaves much to be desired, with any luck you and Lanuhanu will polish him into a soldier worthy of the feathers he wears."

48,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_000","Ohokaliy, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Of course I know your name─who isn't familiar with Wuk Lamat's companions? Not to mention your friends can't seem to go a moment without mentioning you, hah!"
49,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_001","I'm Lanuhanu, and I have the honor of being the Wind's Chosen. It is my feathers which adorn the festive float!"
50,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_002","I feel the wind has guided you to me for a reason. As a visitor to our village who has fast become an honored friend, I would offer you a chance to strengthen our bonds."
51,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_003","Perhaps you're familiar with the Landsguard? It is customary among the Wind's Chosen to save their molted feathers and present them to these brave protectors as gifts every few years."
52,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_004","At this very moment one of their number is making their way to Ok'hanu to receive our offering. But there's much more to it than just a simple delivery, and I think you'd be interested in taking part."
53,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_005","It would deepen your understanding of our ways, and perhaps you and this member of the Landsguard will become fast friends!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_006","I would start with a small task, if you're willing. Nahanshe is the name of our guest, and he was due to arrive some time ago─I fear he may be lost. Could you search the road for him? I'll stay behind in case he arrives here after all."
55,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_010","Nahanshe was due to arrive a while ago, but he seems to be running late. I'll stay here in case he comes─could you search the road for him?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_030","You're looking for me? You're not a Hanuhanu. Unless you're molting something awful..."
57,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_031","Ah, so that's the way of it. Well, now that you've found me, I suppose I better get on with it."
58,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_032","Sorry for my...lack of enthusiasm. I joined the Landsguard hoping I could bust some skulls, slaughter some beasts─you know, use these muscles of mine."
59,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_033","But for my first assignment I'm lugging crates of supplies around... It's not exactly what I had in mind."
60,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_034","Eh, I suppose complaining won't get this done any faster. Let's go meet this Lanuhanu, then."
61,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_040","I thought I was just coming here to pick up some feathers. My superiors didn't say anything about helping someone."
62,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_060","You found him! Now we can begin. Before the gift of feathers is to be bestowed, there are proper steps that must be taken!"
63,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_061","Firstly, I bid the warmest of welcomes to Nahanshe! As the Wind's Chosen, it is my solemn duty to show you what sights our humble village has to offer!"
64,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_062","As one of the Landsguard, it behooves you to become familiar with all corners of the continent, yes? Then come with me to the center of Ok'hanu, where you can behold the entire village at once!"
65,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_070","What a load of..."
66,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_075","Perhaps you've seen this sight─perhaps not. Either way, feast your eyes upon Ok'hanu!"
67,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_100","Take it all in─this is Ok'hanu! As you can see, our homes are made from wood and reeds, both of which the forest blesses us with in abundance."
68,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_102","But nature's blessings are to be treated with care, for dry reeds can easily catch flame. And if they do, we risk setting our entire village alight."
69,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_106","Building waterways through Ok'hanu is a way to protect us from such incidents. But aquatic beasts can travel them as well, and when these beasts become too great in number, we beseech the Landsguard to cull them."
70,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_107","Do you, now? I always thought hunting duty was just a way to keep us sharp... While I'm here, I'll make sure nothing troubles your home."
71,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_108","All of Ok'hanu would thank you!"
72,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_109","And now for the reason you came─the feathers of the Wind's Chosen! They're used to adorn the equipment worn by the Landsguard."
73,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_110","The design evokes the image of Kixaihih, the great bird revered by all Hanuhanu. The feathers give it a touch of authenticity that make the soldiers appear all the fiercer!"
74,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_111","Every soldier's outfit is designed according to their profession, and each feather must undergo an elaborate process of dyeing and oiling to meet the Landsguard's varied needs."
75,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_112","So without further ado, let us begin! I first ask that you come meet me at the gate to the southeast."
76,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_113","Hmph. Fine. I should warn you─I'm not known for my delicate hands."
77,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_114","That went about as well as expected. Could you stay behind for a moment, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? I would like to hear your opinion of Nahanshe."
78,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_Q1_000_100","What will you say?"
79,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_A1_000_100","He's not the most motivated person."
80,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_A2_000_100","He really doesn't want to be here."
81,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_A3_000_100","..."
82,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_120","I have the same impression. Truth be told, his attitude is the same as every Landsguard troop who comes to receive this gift─and we're meant to fix it."
83,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_125","Is it too early to tell? I understand...he seems uninterested, but was eager to offer his services in culling beasts."
84,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_126","Nevertheless, his attitude could use improvement. Truth be told, every Landsguard troop who comes to receive our gift is the same way──and we're meant to fix it."
85,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_130","Consider this a rite of passage of sorts. The Landsguard sends us troops whose rough edges want for polish, and the tasks we set before them serve as a whetstone."
86,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_131","Over the course of our work, they gain a great insight into the history and meaning behind this exchange of gifts. Soldiers with a tangible bond to their charge will protect it all the more staunchly."
87,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_132","In recent days, however, even our treasure trove of knowledge hasn't been enough to rouse the spirits of some. But working alongside someone as capable as you, Nahanshe may find the extra motivation he needs!"
88,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_133","Now then, let us proceed to the southeastern gate. And while this goes without saying, keep this little conversation between us a secret!"
89,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_LANUHANU_000_150","The feathers we send the Landsguard are for decorative purposes, and since they can lay untouched for quite some time, they aren't fit for use on the float."
90,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_170","What did I do to deserve this? Now I know why my superiors were snickering behind my back as I departed."
91,"TEXT_KINGZC201_05081_NAHANSHE_000_171","The Hanuhanu might think this bird god is worth all this trouble, but I just want to get it over with."
