49,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_SWIPOSTIK_000_001","Wait, you! You're the adventurer who is hand-lending the Third Promise, are you not? You must hand-lend Swipostik, too!"
50,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_SWIPOSTIK_000_002","Many Fires is a busy peddleplace, and Swipostik her most trusted porterbroker, arranging transport between here and Earthenshire. Everything came to a quickstop when the bigwind struck, but now the road to Earthenshire is open again..."
51,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_SWIPOSTIK_000_003","...and Many Fires is rafterpacked with travelers and traders who need Swipostik's help! It is all too much for one Mobbie to handle! Please, adventurer, help Swipostik─by asking the traveltraders what handhelp they need!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_SWIPOSTIK_000_004","Swipostik cannot let down his tradefriends. He has a reputation to protect!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_PABLU_000_005","...Am I looking for passage to Earthenshire? Not me, friend. I'm heading for Ok'hanu."
54,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_PABLU_000_006","Just trying to figure out the best way to go about it─whether to wait for the Flight of We Wingless to be repaired, or to try to find another way around."
55,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_VEDOLLJA_000_007","...Earthenshire? Isn't that the Moblin village where they keep all the artisans? I hadn't thought about paying the place a visit, but now that you mention it..."
56,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_VEDOLLJA_000_008","To tell it true, I came here looking for mercenary work, guarding caravans and whatnot. Earthenshire might be just the place for me. With all the gold and jewels they handle, I warrant the Moblins'll pay through the mask for guards."
57,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_HUNMUQAT_000_009","...Yes, that's right. I'm Earthenshire-bound. And I can't leave soon enough─my fruit's already on the turn."
58,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_HUNMUQAT_000_010","It's bananas, mostly. Some apples. A few peaches. Basically, anything you can eat with one hand while you carry on working with the other. The artisans can't get enough of them."
59,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_REBLI_000_011","Do you know when the next wagon for Earthenshire leaves? I have monies for the artisans. Proceeds from selling their wares in the markets of Tuliyollal, minus a small commission, of course."
60,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_REBLI_000_012","I'm very keen to get there by the due date─not only in order to avoid any late delivery penalties, but because I simply cannot wait to see what new miracles those master craftsmen have created!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_PABLU_000_013","Like I said, I'm heading for Ok'hanu, not Earthenshire. Unless you'd have me climb down the cliffs, it's the wrong direction."
62,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_VEDOLLJA_000_014","There could be good money for mercenaries over in Earthenshire now that the stairs are down. Fewer wagons on the road will make the highwaymen turn their attentions elsewhere."
63,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_HUNMUQAT_000_015","I hope the artisans don't mind their snacks a bit mushy..."
64,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_REBLI_000_016","The artisans are usually too consumed by their art to care about money matters. The Moblins, though, are wont to take any delay in payment as a betrayal of their precious “potsworn,” and demand that amends be made..."
65,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_SWIPOSTIK_000_017","Pfffkohhh! Excellent work, my friend. Now Swipostik knows who needs wagonlending, all that remains is to decide who to wagonlend to first!"
66,"TEXT_KINGZC108_05078_SWIPOSTIK_000_018","Fresh fruit, he thinks. Earthenshire artisans need mindfuel after all. Then the trinketseller and the swordlender...and finally, the northgoer! Whether Earthenshire or no, Swipostik will suremake that everyone goes where they need to go!"
