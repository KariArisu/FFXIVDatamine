50,"TEXT_KINGYR104_05006_ELSEBEEIRONHEART_000_002","Well, if you've met Cousin Millith, I'm sure you can guess why I “crossed the salt,” as they say. This continent is positively brimming with sights unseen by Eorzean eyes, and I'm here to discover them all!"
51,"TEXT_KINGYR104_05006_ELSEBEEIRONHEART_000_003","My twin sister and I, that is. You see, I had more interest in Yok, while she was drawn to the vistas of Xak. So it was that we parted ways at the bridge, each of us touring half of Tural."

59,"TEXT_KINGYR104_05006_SYSTEM_000_011","Use your wits and the notes provided by Elsebee to identify these stunning sights and the proper way to appreciate them, and see Tural as only the greatest explorers have seen her!"
