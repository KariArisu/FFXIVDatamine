49,"TEXT_KINGYR103_05005_ENGINEERA05005_000_001","Ahahaha, I knew it! You, my heroic friend, are in luck, for I'm granting you permission to test your might against my indomitable dummies. Usually they're reserved for military research, but I'm willing to make an exception for one of <Emphasis>your</Emphasis> talents!"

53,"TEXT_KINGYR103_05005_ENGINEERA05005_100_010","I am a researcher for Oblivion, namely in the field of electrope engineering. During Zoraal Ja's reign, I survived within the ranks of his army by helping to research and develop protective materials."
54,"TEXT_KINGYR103_05005_ENGINEERA05005_000_011","One of my many projects was these indomitable dummies, and as their name implies, their durability is second to none. They were used to measure the offensive potential of an entire arsenal of weapons to great effect."
