Murfurlur is in the market for a new client."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_SEQ_01","Though he is heartened by the praise he received for his first commission, Murfurlur is not content to wait for new clients to seek him out. He wishes to take the initiative and travel to Wachunpelo to sell his services, but is still concerned that the villagers there might be frightened by his presence. Once more he seeks to rely on you, this time asking if you happen to know any Pelupelu merchants who might be willing to employ a bodyguard. Fortunately, you might know just the one: Nopli, the merchant who recently came into possession of a cache of corrupted crystals.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_SEQ_02","Talk of Murfurlur and how he protected a fisherman has spread like wildfire among the Pelupelu, and Nopli is eager to hire him. All that remains is to facilitate their meeting."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_SEQ_03","Nopli explains that he wants to pay a visit to the Chirwagur and broker a deal for their salt, but has been reluctant to do so owing to their reputation for intimidating buyers into paying outrageous prices. Murfurlur is willing to accompany him, though he is concerned that this may be more difficult than Nopli anticipates, as the Chirwagur truly believe that might makes right. It is clear that he would like you to accompany them in case negotiations go poorly."
4,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_SEQ_04","As Murfurlur feared, the Chirwagur bristle at the thought of trading with Nopli, demanding that he surrender his coin and leave empty-handed. However, with your encouragement, the former temple guardian names himself, causing the other giants to back down in respect and giving the merchant an opening to explain why trading salt for corrupted crystals would benefit both parties. Though curious, most of the Chirwagur remain distrustful, but Murfurlur stands firm and vouches for the Pelupelu. Ultimately, the Chirwagur leave, unwilling to believe Nopli's promises...save for a single giant, who agrees to trade salt─a giant whom you previously met along with Vorporlor, and whom Wuk Lamat saved once before. Her deeds─and yours─have earned you a measure of trust, and in time, perhaps the others will change their minds as well."
5,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_SEQ_05","Though the outcome fell rather short of his expectations, Nopli is nonetheless content with what little he managed to achieve during this visit. Not wanting to wear out his welcome, he states that you all should return to Worlar's Echo."
6,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_SEQ_06","Nopli is nothing if not optimistic about the possibility of peaceful trade relations with the Chirwagur, but he knows it will take considerable time and effort. Fortunately, he knows who to call upon for his next trip to the saltern. Indeed, it seems that this is only the beginning of a fruitful partnership between the Pelupelu merchant and Murfurlur, who thanks you again for your constant support, and states that he will always carry your memory in his heart."

49,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_MURFURLUR_000_001","Do you recall the fisher who said he would sing my praises to his people?"
50,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_MURFURLUR_000_002","Rather than wait for his words to bring new clients to me, I want to take the initiative and travel to Wachunpelo to sell my services. However, I am aware many Pelupelu are still intimidated by my kind."
51,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_MURFURLUR_000_003","You wouldn't happen to know any there who could use a bodyguard? One with whom you may have worked before?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_MURFURLUR_000_004","A merchant named Nopli, you say? Perhaps you could make the journey to Wachunpelo and speak to him on my behalf."
53,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_MURFURLUR_000_005","I do not mean to suggest you will be going alone. I shall descend the cliff and wait for you just outside the village, so as not to cause a disturbance."
54,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_010","Well, if it isn't <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Thanks again for helping me work things out with Gigimolu."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_011","As for those corrupted crystals, I've stored them in a warded pot to contain their chaotic energies. The good news is, I think I know just how to put them to use!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_012","Right─enough about me. Is there something I can do for you?"
57,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_013","...Murfurlur the Defender!? Of course I've heard of him! He's the Yok Huy who saved one of our fishermen, right? Everyone has been talking about it!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_014","I would love to make his acquaintance. In fact, I might even have a job for him! How soon can we meet?"

60,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_016","Wow, these Yok Huy are something else! In any case, if he's nearby, then now is as good a time as any!"

63,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_MURFURLUR_000_022","Nopli, I'm told you are a merchant by trade. If you should have need of a bodyguard, I would gladly offer my services."

65,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_024","This might just be a golden opportunity for us both. You see, I want to make a deal with the folks at Chirwagur Saltern."
66,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_025","Thing is, the Chirwagur are infamous for bullying the weak into buying their salt at outrageous prices. The word “no” tends to invite vicious neck throttlings, or so it is strongly intimated."
67,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_026","But hey, I like a good challenge! And as long as you have my back, I'm sure I needn't fear for my neck, right? So follow me!"
68,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_MURFURLUR_000_030","With your help, it seems I have already secured another commission. Yet I must confess a feeling of unease."
69,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_MURFURLUR_000_031","The Chirwagur cling to the “glory” of the old days, when the Yok Huy ruled over all. In their eyes, to wield violence and take that which they covet is right and true. Regardless, I shall do whatever it takes to keep Nopli safe."

73,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_MURFURLUR_000_035","By “divine blessing,” they refer to their salt. And Nopli is in no position to bargain. The best course may be to retreat..."

82,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_041","Of course, I wouldn't waste your time if I wasn't confident I could offer something worth your while. As we all know, the flames of Valigarmanda linger on in these parts, yes?"
83,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_042","Well, I have to imagine all that everlasting fire would have less-than-desirable effects on your crops and livestock. That's why you're forced to sell your salt at such high prices, right? You have to make a living somehow!"
84,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_043","But what if I told you could use these <Emphasis>corrupted crystals</Emphasis>, imported from distant Eorzea, to solve your woes!?"

86,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_045","By constructing a series of converters, you could turn those undying flames into nutrients for the soil and all sorts of other wonderful things! The possibilities are endless!"

88,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_047","Any merchant who wears this mask is sworn to uphold the peddlers' code of honor! We Pelupelu pride ourselves on spreading joy through trade!"

100,"TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_NOPLI_000_070","That, uh...didn't go as well as I'd hoped. I only managed to trade one measly crystal for a fistful of salt."
