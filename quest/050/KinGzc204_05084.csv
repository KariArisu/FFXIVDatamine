Nahanshe is visibly shaken."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_SEQ_01","Nahanshe is troubled by the accusations of Zulihali and the others, and resolves to learn the truth behind the Dawnservant's past actions. The obvious course of action is to return to Ok'hanu and ask Lanuhanu what he knows.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_SEQ_02","You arrive at Ok'hanu only to find the Wind's Chosen is nowhere in sight. With no other options, Nahanshe suggests asking some of the younger Hanuhanu to see if Zulihali's disdain of the Landsguard is shared."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_SEQ_03","From your conversations with the young Hanuhanu, you form an incomplete picture of the Dawnservant's controversial rescue of Ok'hanu. Perhaps Nahanshe has thoughts on what it all means."
4,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_SEQ_04","Your conversation with Nahanshe is interrupted by the arrival of a flustered Lanuhanu. He informs you that he was waylaid by Zulihali and the other young Hanu, who then stole the crate of feathers and are now holding them ransom until Nahanshe provides his answer. The unnerved Landsguard asks you and Lanuhanu to stall the group before rushing off to complete an unknown task. Lanuhanu then assures you that this is all part of the process, and bids you go to Zulihali to see the final results."
5,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_SEQ_05","Nahanshe comes slightly later than the appointed time, and gives a heartfelt appeal, confessing regret over his past conduct and expressing a new appreciation of his duty. Impressed by this, Zulihali and Lanuhanu reveal that this was all a ruse meant to guide him along this path. While the Landsguard is confused at first, he accepts the lesson learned, and wishes to offer a prayer to Kixaihih before his departure. Lanuhanu asks you to wait at Ok'hanu for him to deliver newly blessed feathers."
6,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_SEQ_06","As promised, Lanuhanu arrives with Nahanshe in tow. Both the Hanu and the Landsguard thank you for your role in this rite of passage, and Nahanshe looks forward to seeing the rest of Tural from a bright new perspective."

49,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_001","And why would Lanuhanu act so proud to have his feathers adorning our equipment? I'm no good with numbers, but even I can tell something doesn't add up here..."
50,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_Q1_000_100","What will you say?"
51,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_A1_000_100","We'll have to find the truth ourselves."
52,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_A2_000_100","We should learn more about their history."
53,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_A3_000_100","I thought something was off, too..."
54,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_005","You might be right. It was my ignorance that seemed to set her off, after all. Whatever happens, I'd like to leave here on the Hanu's good side. "
55,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_010","Ah, then it wasn't just me. Either way, I'd like to leave here on the Hanu's good side. "
56,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_015","Well, our best bet is probably to return to Ok'hanu. If anyone can tell us the truth about what happened with the Dawnservant, it would be Lanuhanu."
57,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_020","I don't see him...but the crate's not here, either. He might have left to Kozanuakiy already."
58,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_021","Wouldn't we have seen him on the road if he had, though? ...Eh, the forest is vast, I suppose. Anyways, maybe one of the younger Hanuhanu around here can tell us if Zulihali's scorn is shared. Let's ask around, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
59,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_OONUHALI_000_040","Of course, every Hanu knows the story of the Dawnservant's visit. But it might be more accurate to call it a “rescue”..."
60,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_OONUHALI_000_041","For at the time, our home was beset by beasts and fiends. When Gulool Ja Ja heard this terrible news, he personally came to drive out every last one!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_GONUHANU_000_050","Zulihali said all that? Well, I do remember hearing that when our ancestors beheld the ruined figure, some of them viewed it as a terrible insult, even though they were saved."
62,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_GONUHANU_000_051","Could that grudge have been inherited by their children and grandchildren? I can't speak on such matters, but perhaps Lanuhanu can. He is wise in our ways, and makes an effort to befriend everyone he can."
63,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_GINUHALI_000_060","The likeness of Kixaihih? My father actually worked to repair it! He told me that the Dawnservant's slaughter of the beasts was swift and brutal, but left many of our shrines and homes damaged in its wake."
64,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_GINUHALI_000_061","But what choice did he have? The fiends were at our doors! My father and his friends agreed that it was better to be alive─at least that way they could rebuild."
65,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_OONUHALI_000_070","If the Dawnservant hadn't come, Ok'hanu would now be nothing but a den of wild beasts!"
66,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_GONUHANU_000_075","Lanuhanu makes friends with everyone, and would know best if some of the other young Hanu still bear a grudge about the past."
67,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_GINUHALI_000_080","Gulool Ja Ja showed no restraint, but it was the only way to save us. My father and his friends all agree on that."
68,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_100","What's the word, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? From what I heard, the Dawnservant really did destroy that sacred figure..."
69,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_101","I see. I can't say I'm surprised that some Hanuhanu would bear a grudge... So, Zulihali was telling the truth."
70,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_102","Something still doesn't sit right with me, though. The Dawnservant wouldn't simply go on a rampage and leave the Hanu to clean things up. He'd have more compassion than that..."
71,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_LANUHANU_000_103","Nahanshe, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! You won't believe what happened!"
72,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_LANUHANU_000_104","I was surrounded by Zulihali and her cronies while on my way to the shrine! They stole the crate of feathers from out of my claws, saying no Landsguard could have it until Nahanshe gave his answer!"
73,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_LANUHANU_000_105","I assume you know what they're talking about? They said if you ignore their demand, they'll burn every last feather!"

75,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_107","Gods be good... I'm sorry, but can you go and stall them for a while? There's something I must look into first!"
76,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_LANUHANU_000_108","...I know what you're thinking, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. “Isn't this going a little too far?”"
77,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_LANUHANU_000_109","I would answer that the results shall speak for themselves. Now we simply wait and see what Nahanshe brings us."
78,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_LANUHANU_000_112","Zulihali and the others are waiting to the south of the shrine. Let us go there and “stall” them, as Nahanshe requested."

81,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_ZULIHALI_000_121","And while our methods may appear rather blunt to you, wait until Nahanshe speaks before you judge us. Wait quietly, and hear his answer..."
82,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_ZULIHALI_000_130","I don't know why you make us wait so long, Nahanshe, but I hope whatever you found was worth it."
83,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_131","I, uh...I spoke with the eldest Hanu in your village. He told me the story of the Dawnservant's visit and the destruction of the Kixaihih's likeness─the <Emphasis>whole</Emphasis> story."
84,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_132","It seems he─particularly the Head of Reason─was filled with anguish at the sight, and offered his deepest apologies. To make amends, he devised a way to assemble an even more robust figure from the remains of the previous one."
85,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_133","His work was done overnight, and the Head of Resolve called upon the whole village to celebrate their newfound peace. For the first time in a long while, Ihih'hana commenced, and the Dawnservant was chosen to ride the sacred float."
86,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_134","After the festivities, the Dawnservant said that when he finally established a unified nation in Tural, he wanted a motif representing Kixaihih to be among those used in his soldiers' uniforms. "
87,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_135","He declared that different tribes can forge friendships so long as they open their hearts to one another. That his nation would be one where peoples of all stripes could live in harmony. His soldiers would become a symbol of that promise."
88,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_ZULIHALI_000_136","So, you can learn for yourself after all. But you should have come here with that knowledge already seared into your memory."
89,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_137","I know... I have no excuse for my ignorance, and the petulance born from it. This experience has taught me so many things..."
90,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_138","And now, with full knowledge of this history, I'm filled with a much greater sense of purpose than before. I feel more keenly than ever that my duty as a Landsguard is to serve every corner of Tural!"
91,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_139","But to fulfill that duty, we must have our equipment. So please, I beg of you, entrust the feathers to me in good faith!"

97,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_145","So, my superiors weren't pulling one over on me...they were <Emphasis>worried</Emphasis> about me. I didn't realize my conduct was so concerning..."

99,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_ZULIHALI_000_147","But before you do that, aren't there more places to visit? More materials to collect? We Hanu aren't the only people who love teaching lessons."
100,"TEXT_KINGZC204_05084_NAHANSHE_000_148","Please, I don't want to think about that now! I was worried sick enough imagining what would happen if I couldn't get the feathers."
