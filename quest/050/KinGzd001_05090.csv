49,"TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_001","Since the storm raged through these parts, we've seen a marked increase in the number of ill-tempered mantises. If left unchecked, they could prove a threat to the forest's natural balance."
50,"TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_002","Normally, I'd send a group of our own to take care of them, but we're shorthanded at the moment. I reckon you could do the culling of a pair of hunters, though."
51,"TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_003","So, I'll ask you to rid us of two of these nuisances. You can find them to the south of our village─and good luck, though I doubt you need it."
52,"TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_005","Though you may be tempted to slaughter them all, two should be enough to keep their numbers in check."
53,"TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_010","You're back, and much quicker than I thought you'd be! You've made a difference today, even if you can't tell at a glance."
54,"TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_011","Those things are ravenous, and mindlessly engulf smaller prey to sate their bottomless hunger."
55,"TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_012","Normally larger animals would keep their numbers in check, but there are far fewer predators stalking the woods since the storm. This has given the mantises a chance to flourish, but at the expense of everything else."
56,"TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_013","Of course, the natural inclination of living things is to reproduce, but nature rests on a delicate balance. Maintaining that balance is only one of a hunter's duties."
57,"TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_014","Today you helped us restore a small bit of harmony to the forest, and I hope you gained a deeper understanding of our relationship to the land we call home. I'm honored to have worked with one of Wuk Lamat's own!"
