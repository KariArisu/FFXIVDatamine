Lanuhanu is eager to see his feathers blessed."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_SEQ_01","The feathers cannot be delivered to the Landsguard until they receive the wind's blessing, and luckily Lanuhanu volunteers to deliver the crate to the likeness of Kixaihih in Kozanuakiy. He bids you and Nahanshe to meet a friend of his who awaits you on the road for an unspecified task.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_SEQ_02","It seems your next job is a familiar one─you are to cull beasts near the shallow waters of Uyuypoga and then gather bark from the trees nearby. Kixaihih will accept no less if you are to receive the wind's blessing."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_SEQ_03","The creatures prove little trouble, leaving the area free from nasty threats. Gather bark from the nearby trees without fear of surprise attacks."
4,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_SEQ_04","The fragrant bark comes off easily enough, and you quickly gather the required quantity. While you know not how Nahanshe fared, you may as well bring the bark to the carefree Hanu."
5,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_SEQ_05","The Hanu is pleased with your work, and explains that according to legend, the bark was burned to drive away wicked beasts when the Hanuhanu first settled the forest. Now it is burned before battle for good luck, and as such it is only natural that this blessing should be bestowed upon the equipment of the Landsguard as well. The Hanu instructs you to bring your bounty to Kozanuakiy, and asks you to offer a prayer to the likeness of Kixaihih on the way."
6,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_SEQ_06","You arrive at Kozanuakiy with the bark and offer a prayer to Kixaihih, and Nahanshe wonders aloud why the Hanuhanu have such respect for the Landsguard. Just as this thought is uttered, a group of Hanu approach you and one introduces herself as Zulihali. She then harangues Nahanshe for his ignorance of history and for his attitude during this ordeal, refusing to give the feathers and expressing disdain for the Landsguard. When asked why, she reveals that the sacred figure of Kixaihih was once destroyed by the Dawnservant and impresses upon Nahanshe that he must answer for his own conduct, or else. The overblown anger of Zulihali and her cohorts clearly perturbs Nahanshe, and he asks you to allow him some time to think."

55,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_HANUHANU05083_000_050","Welcome, welcome! I understand you seek the blessing of the wind. The priestess requires a special type of bark to complete the ceremony, and your job is to gather it."
56,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_HANUHANU05083_000_051","But you must tread carefully, for the shores where the trees are found teem with hungry beasts. I suggest clearing the area first so one doesn't sneak up on you!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_NAHANSHE_000_052","I don't mind a bit of hunting, but these arms aren't meant for─ Ah, apologies. I suppose complaining is a habit I should aim to break..."

59,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_HANUHANU05083_000_060","Without the right bark, Kixaihih will not bestow the wind's blessing. But hungry beasts roam the shores, so I suggest clearing the area before you get to gathering."

61,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_HANUHANU05083_000_100","Well done, you two! You brought exactly what I asked, but I suppose you're still curious as to why the bark had to be from those specific trees."
62,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_HANUHANU05083_000_101","The answer lies within the legend of Kixaihih. You see, our ancestors hailed from a different land, and were guided here by the great bird. But upon their arrival, they found perilous woodlands, overrun by hungry fiends..."
63,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_HANUHANU05083_000_102","Many Hanu were lost to the gluttonous appetite of the wilds, and they had nearly succumbed to despair. But then Kixaihih let out a mighty screech. It echoed through the land, setting the trees aglow!"
64,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_HANUHANU05083_000_103","Taking this as divine guidance, our beleaguered ancestors took bark from the trunks and burnt it. The smoke wafted through the air, and the beasts found it so repugnant they were forced to flee, one and all!"
65,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_HANUHANU05083_000_104","Since that day, warriors would burn incense before battle in the hopes it would ward them from harm. Thus we bless the Landsguard's feathers in the same way, that they, too, might bask in Kixaihih's protection."
66,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_HANUHANU05083_000_105","Now, take the bark to Kozanuakiy, and on the way, I would be glad if you offered your sincerest prayers to the great bird."

70,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_NAHANSHE_000_150","...The Hanu take their traditions seriously, don't they? I knew they wished for good harvests and such, but never imagined we Landsguard were in their thoughts all this time."
71,"TEXT_KINGZC203_05083_NAHANSHE_000_151","This has been an eye-opening experience, to be sure. But I can't help but wonder why we're so important to them. Why allow us to use their revered god in the designs of our equipment?"
