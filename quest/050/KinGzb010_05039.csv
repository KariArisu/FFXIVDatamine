49,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_PANICEDPELUPELU05039_000_001","My caravan was attacked by beasts! I had a bodyguard─a young Mamool Ja mercenary, but he could barely fend for himself, let alone me!"
50,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_PANICEDPELUPELU05039_000_002","He somehow managed to throw me over his shoulder and carry me all the way here. But no sooner did my feet touch the ground than he ran back into the jaws of death. Damned if I can figure out why."
51,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_PANICEDPELUPELU05039_000_003","Injured as he was, I don't like his chances. Please, I beg of you─go to Chabayuqeq, and save him!"

54,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_MERCENARYMAMOOLJA05039_000_011","Ah, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Thank you for saving me. As a mercenary for hire, I'm ashamed such help was even necessary."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_MERCENARYMAMOOLJA05039_000_012","So the merchant sent you, did she? The attack on the caravan saw her wares scattered all over. I figured the least I could do was retrieve as much as I could."
56,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_MERCENARYMAMOOLJA05039_000_013","Thanks to your timely rescue, I can still do just that. No need for you to stay with me, friend. Go and let her know that I'm safe. I'll grab what I can and be along shortly."

59,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_PANICEDPELUPELU05039_000_021","The Mamool Ja take considerable pride in their trade as mercenaries, but that young man seems to have a particularly acute sense of responsibility."
60,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_PANICEDPELUPELU05039_000_023","I've heard tell that some Mamool Ja travel across the salt to make a name for themselves. As a preliminary step to that, it seems many young hopefuls gather experience here in Tural as mercenaries and bodyguards to sharpen their skills."
61,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_PANICEDPELUPELU05039_000_026","That said, earnest as he is, the young man failed to protect my caravan. We will have to discuss some form of compensation for my losses."
62,"TEXT_KINGZB010_05039_PANICEDPELUPELU05039_000_027","I'm not heartless, however. He saved my life and risked his own to reclaim my wares─there is much to consider. For now, however, treating his wounds must come first."
