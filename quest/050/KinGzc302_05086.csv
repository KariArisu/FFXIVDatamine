Anfroy is eager to learn more about Movamuq's secret treasure."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_SEQ_01","Anfroy's interest has been piqued by Tarnotik's mention of the “treasure” that Movamuq carries close to her heart─a gift given to her by Anfroy in his younger years. He asks that you interrogate Tarnotik again to learn more.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_SEQ_02","Tarnotik knows no more about Movamuq's treasure, but he knows how you might learn more about it. He entrusts you with a toolbox that Movamuq requested he procure for her, and bids you deliver it to her─volunteering to help her find the materials he was unable to procure at the same time."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_SEQ_03","You speak with Movamuq, who reveals that her treasure is a ruby that Anfroy entrusted to her safekeeping after he scratched it, that none might know of his once shoddy handiwork. She means to make the jewel the centerpiece of a farewell present to Anfroy, and asks for your help in securing the remaining materials. First, she sends you back to Anfroy, to ensure that he is so focused on his own work that he will not learn of Movamuq's maneuvers."
4,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_SEQ_04","You inform Anfroy of the identity of Movamuq's treasure, and that she has engaged your services in some secretive task. Inspired by the revelation, he bids you keep Movamuq occupied until his work is complete."
5,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_SEQ_05","With Anfroy absorbed in his work, you return to Movamuq that she might begin hers in earnest."

49,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_ANFROY_000_010","So, regarding ideas for my present for Movamuq, the particular item of information that caught my ear was that nugget of Tarnotik's."
50,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_ANFROY_000_011","He said that she treasures the, er...“treasure” that I once gave her, right? Then she would surely love something similar! "
51,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_ANFROY_000_012","Alas, I can't remember ever actually having given her a gift, as such. It must have been very early in my career..."
52,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_ANFROY_000_013","Could you speak with Tarnotik again? I know he said he had no idea what this treasure was, but any little details he might have gleaned─its size, or its shape, the occasion I gave it to her─might just be enough to jog my memory."

56,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_TARNOTIK_000_032","Why not ask Movamuq straightface? Tarnotik can give uplander perfect askchance. Recentwise, Movamuq asked Tarnotik to bring her some craftgoods for a sneakysecret crafttask."
57,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_TARNOTIK_000_033","He managed to obtain the toolbox she ordered, but the second craftgood eluded him. Tarnotik is shamefaced for his failure! He wants to mendmake for hopesmashing, so he sends a strongarm adventurer who can succeed where he failed!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZC302_05086_TARNOTIK_000_034","Go, go. Take the toolbox to Movamuq, and tell her Tarnotik sends you to handhelp with the crafttask! Hee hee! Lowlander handhelps not only crafthand, but helphand too!"
