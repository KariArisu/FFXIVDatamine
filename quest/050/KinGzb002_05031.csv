56,"TEXT_KINGZB002_05031_POVLI_000_022","Tell me, did you notice the little bits of red on their cuticles as you packed them into the sacks? It's nothing to be alarmed about, but those are in fact <Emphasis>parasites</Emphasis>."
57,"TEXT_KINGZB002_05031_POVLI_000_023","Once infested by the vilekin, the notocactuar gradually weaken. Eventually, they wander away from their prickly peers and settle in the southwestern hills, though it's not entirely clear if this migration is of their own volition."
58,"TEXT_KINGZB002_05031_POVLI_000_024","When we've found a notocactuar completely sapped of strength, we brush the parasites ailing it into a bag, dry them, and finally crush them to extract the carmine within."
