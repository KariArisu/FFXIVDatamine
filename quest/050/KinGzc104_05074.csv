49,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_VENDAVOQ_000_001","Vendavoq asks all around the village, and some say that he went to pay a visit to the Imperious─the giants' prayplace. But prayplace is a dangerplace! Full of friendmunching fiends!"
50,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_VENDAVOQ_000_002","You are a fighter, are you not? Will you swordlend for Vendavoq, and save her dear twinklecrafter from certain doom?"
51,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_VENDAVOQ_000_003","It is Vendavoq's duty to look after her twinklecrafter as best she can...but if she ventures into the Imperious to search for him, she will surely become fiendfood! Please, lowlander, you must hand-lend!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_004","...You're looking for a “twinklecrafter”? That's me, most likely─I'm one of the Moblins' contracted artisans, specializing in jewelrymaking. Vendavoq was concerned for my safety, you say?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_005","How kind of her to send me my own personal guard! I've ever been fascinated by the unique visual language of the Yok Huy, you see. I often visit this place to bask in its grand, imposing glory."
54,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_006","Yet I have never once taken a step beyond this point. The beasts that lurk within are far too dangerous to risk delving any further...but with you at my side, I can finally make a detailed study of the rest of the ruins!"
55,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_007","Such as what remains of them, of course. Five hundred years have come and gone since the giants returned to their ancestral lands, and they have not been kind to the creations they left behind. Yet some of the larger structures still remain─this impressive gate, for one."
56,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_008","They say the Yok Huy towered yalms above even the tallest Xbr'aal, but I wonder if their architecture might have played some part in exaggerating those tales─its sheer sense of scale serving to inflate the giants' own... But enough speculation, let us press on! We have much to discover!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_009","Pillars of stone overlooking the nave... Fascinating, isn't it? The simple combination of geometric shapes naturally draws one's eyes to the center, all the while maintaining a delicate balance."
58,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_010","As the sun traversed the sky, so too would the shadows of the towers above paint patterns on the ground below."
59,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_011","And not just any patterns, oh no. <Emphasis>Calculations</Emphasis>. Every stone cut and placed with mathematical precision, divining the movement of the stars and the changing of the seasons! A triumph of both form and function! True artistry!"
60,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_012","But wait─what's that over there, by the cliff's edge? Quickly, with me!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_013","Thank you...and forgive me for racing ahead like that. I was so absorbed in examining every ilm of this place, I clean forgot the reason I'd never done so before..."
62,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_014","But if anything is worth risking one's life for, it is surely this. Why, just look at this tower! It's a work of art!"
63,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_015","To the untrained eye, it might appear little more than a pile of stone, but look at how each brick is cut and positioned perfectly to align with its neighbors─and not a drop of mortar to hold them in place! The engravings, too, surely have some religious significance. They certainly inspire reverence in me!"
64,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_016","Yes, yes─“inspiring reverence.” That's the thing. Why else would the giants build their temple upon the clifftop, if not to make daily proof of their predominance over those who dwelled in the plains below? Those who were beneath them in every way."
65,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_017","One cannot help but admire them. That their creations should awe and exhilarate us even now, centuries since they've been gone."
66,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_ARTIST05074_000_018","Thank you, my friend! My passion for jewelrycraft had been cooling of late, but now I am positively burning with inspiration! If the Yok Huy's creations can echo through the ages, then so can mine! To Earthenshire, and eternity!"
67,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_VENDAVOQ_000_019","Bigthanks for bringing the twinklecrafter back to us!"
68,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_VENDAVOQ_000_020","Not only is he safe and well, but full of mindfruit, too. He says that he found it in the giants' prayplace."
69,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_VENDAVOQ_000_021","This need for mindfruit is common among the potsworn. Some try to find it in history, some in nature...some even in firewater! It is our side of the potpact to keep them well supplied with it─a duty that is a constant source of brainpain."
70,"TEXT_KINGZC104_05074_VENDAVOQ_000_022","But oh, the ideas they come up with when they have it! Such freshthinking! Vendavoq can't wait to see what our friendly twinklecrafter wanglecrafts next!"
