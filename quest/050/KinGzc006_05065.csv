I know you're a busy <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>, but might I have a moment of your time?"
49,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_RADOLLJA_000_001","I serve the Dawnservant, and am come here in an effort to catalog the traditional magicks of our continent. In particular, I'm interested in how the Hanuhanu weave the energies of wind. "
50,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_RADOLLJA_000_002","Competing to see who can float a feather the furthest seems to be a favored pastime of the Hanu, which demonstrates their mastery over wind. Yet I've no notion as to <Emphasis>how</Emphasis> they achieve this mastery."
51,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_RADOLLJA_000_003","My best theory is that they undergo intensive training from a young age, but as a recent arrival here, prying into such matters may come off as presumptuous. But you have their trust─might you ask in my stead?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_RADOLLJA_000_004","I fear I'd fast become an unwelcome guest if I were to ask the Hanuhanu about their sacred traditions. But you have won their trust─perhaps they'll be forthcoming about how their mastery of wind is won."
53,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_GINUHALI_000_005","Why does the wind heed us? Why, because we consume the blessing of reeds bestowed upon us by Kozama'uka!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_GINUHALI_000_006","The energy suffused in the earth flows into the reeds, and the reeds flow into our bellies. By that cycle we are gifted with the land's strength."
55,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_GINUHALI_000_007","In other words, the reeds are far more than mere sustenance─they are the very wellspring of our power!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_OONUHALI_000_008","I never considered <Emphasis>why</Emphasis> we are so attuned to the wind, but now that you ask...it must be thanks to our daily meditations and rigorous training!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_OONUHALI_000_009","By listening carefully to the wind's whispers, one can discern the path of its flow, and in so doing achieve total harmony with one's surroundings."
58,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_OONUHALI_000_010","This understanding allows us to summon gales mighty enough to chase clouds from the sky!"
59,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_TONAHANU_000_011","I'm heartened that you would show such interest in our ways. Many know that the Hanuhanu have a deep connection to the wind, but few care to ask how that connection is made."
60,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_TONAHANU_000_012","That being said, it's a question without a single answer. However, I would say that our feathers are the most important tool we have for comprehending the wind's movements."
61,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_TONAHANU_000_013","They're more than just for show─they allow us to sense even the smallest shift in the wind's temperament, and that awareness allows us to direct it as we see fit."
62,"TEXT_KINGZC006_05065_GINUHALI_000_014","The reeds put us in tune with the land's energy, and its strength becomes our own. Strength enough to direct the winds!"
