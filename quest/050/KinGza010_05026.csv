50,"TEXT_KINGZA010_05026_MAID05026_000_003","The riddle inside that envelope was penned by the Second Promise himself. It's the first part of a treasure hunt he devised for his sister."

67,"TEXT_KINGZA010_05026_MAID05026_000_041","Aha, this brings back memories. Many moons ago, the Second Promise had me accompany him to Bayside Bevy─the thought of shopping alone seemed to unnerve him... Anyway, this is what he bought that day."
68,"TEXT_KINGZA010_05026_MAID05026_000_042","He was incredibly fond of his sister. When she begged him to come up with this treasure hunt, he was more than happy to oblige."
