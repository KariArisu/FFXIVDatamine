1,"TEXT_KINGYX102_05014_SEQ_01","Nostalgia hastily informs you of a potential new threat to Solution Nine─what she describes as a “curious anomaly” in Living Memory─and begs your aid in addressing it. Though she admits little else on the matter, you volunteer your services to the cause, and pledge to meet her at the Gate of Remembrance."
2,"TEXT_KINGYX102_05014_SEQ_02","At the Gate of Remembrance, you rendezvous with a remote-controlled sentry operated by Nostalgia herself. She reveals more details on the rift she discovered in Living Memory, and urges you to meet with Constancy, the guide who first led her there, by the esperance wheels."
3,"TEXT_KINGYX102_05014_SEQ_03","Constancy is pleased to see you returned to Living Memory and unveils more details on the area beyond the rift. The Strayborough Deadwalk, he explains, is one of the city's lost districts, and has reconnected with Living Memory for reasons unknown. The cheery fairground is now a haunted shadow of its former self, and you must put to rest the countless dangers that lurk within.

※The Strayborough Deadwalk can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
4,"TEXT_KINGYX102_05014_SEQ_04","The ghoulish aberrations are no more, and Strayborough's streets now lie silent. Nostalgia is eager to learn more of the nightmarish environs, and awaits you with Constancy in Yesterland."
5,"TEXT_KINGYX102_05014_SEQ_05","Constancy listens attentively to your report, and raises a theory as to the fates of the Dreamborough's lost residents─one that suggests their lingering memories warped it into the Strayborough Deadwalk you traversed. With Träumerei's defeat, however, the memories shall be granted eternal rest, and Constancy's final task as a guide is complete. Before you and Nostalgia return to the Neon Stein, Constancy expresses his thanks as he bids the two of you one last farewell."
6,"TEXT_KINGYX102_05014_SEQ_06","Upon your arrival to Solution Nine, Nostalgia greets you as her true self. Your efforts have allowed Oblivion to continue their investigation of Living Memory and delve deeper into its secrets, though its future remains uncertain..."
