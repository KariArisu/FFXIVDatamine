49,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_001","Curiosity got the better of me, and so I brought some back here to brew. The taste was simply <Emphasis>exquisite</Emphasis>. I'd like to acquire more, but therein lies the problem."
50,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_002","I found the beans in Chabameki─an area south of here known to be the territory of mountain bears. They'd tear me to shreds, but something tells me you could manage the trip. Here─take these smoke bombs to drive back the bears, and bring back whatever coffee beans you can."
51,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_006","Have no fear, my friend! With that smoke bomb repellent, you'll be safe as can be! Probably, anyway..."

57,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_SYSTEM_000_016","The soil is warm to the touch, and surprisingly moist. Nevertheless, you plunge your hands inside, and retrieve a dripping clump of coffee beans."
58,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_SYSTEM_000_017","The stench emanating from this mound of soil is a veritable assault on the nostrils. But you persevere in the name of delicious coffee, and stick your hands inside to claim one last clump of coffee beans."
59,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_020","Wonderful, you're returned! I'm glad to see you still have all your appendages! Ah, but tell me, were you able to find more of those wondrous coffee beans?"
60,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_021","Marvelous, thank you! Ah, but they seem to be covered in...is that soil?"
61,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_022","Hmm. Well, this appears to be dung. That would explain... <gasp> Aha!"
62,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_023","As omnivores, mountain bears feed upon flora and fauna alike. Unbeknownst to us, however, it seems they've developed a liking for our coffee plants, and have been snacking on them in secret."
63,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_024","But because the beans are difficult to digest, they remain whole in the bears' leavings."
64,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_025","I suspect that while inside their stomachs, the flavors and fragrance of the plants and fruits the bears normally eat permeate the beans, diminishing their bitterness and resulting in coffee beans with a fruity, sweet flavor."
65,"TEXT_KINGZB008_05037_TSABLI_000_026","A most intriguing discovery─one I couldn't have made without your help. Thank you! I daresay we have a new premium blend of coffee on our hands!"
