You would recognize the rustle of this corn anywhere."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_SEQ_01","Once again you cross paths with the Cornservant. As fortune would have it, they stopped in Wachunpelo upon hearing the rumbling of a stomach in need. Ever wont to see the people of Tural well-fed, they bid you help them offer aid to a peckish young Pelupelu.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_SEQ_02","The peckish Pelupelu has been out of sorts of late. Sleep does little to remedy his fatigue, and despite the protests of his stomach, he cannot eat. The Cornservant suspects the boy suffers from malnourishment as a result of eating corn and only corn. While the cuisines your corny companion can offer are limited, they manage to concoct a nutrient-packed corn soup to help the ailing Pelupelu."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_SEQ_03","Once again the power of corn has made the world a little brighter. Even so, there are yet more souls that cry out for satiation. Thus does the Cornservant set out in search of more hungry bellies."

49,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_CORNSERVANT_000_002","Glad to hear it. I was just passing through when a faint rumbling caught my attention, the unmistakable sound of a belly in need. How fortuitous that fate would also guide you here. Might I impose upon you to help me once more?"
50,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_CORNSERVANT_000_003","If you would lend an ear to the poor boy's troubles, I can determine how best to lend an ear of my own."
51,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_CORNSERVANT_000_005","Here he is. He seems awfully distraught, a husk of his usually chipper self, I'm sure."

54,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_CORNSERVANT_000_012","<rustle> I recognize a lover of corn when I see one. The problem, I believe, is that he eats <Emphasis>only</Emphasis> corn. He is exhibiting clear signs of malnourishment for lack of a well-balanced diet."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_CORNSERVANT_000_013","Though my dominion is only over that which is corn and kerneled, there may yet be a way we can help him. Prepared with limewater, my corn can be enriched with additional nutrients. Behold─a rich and creamy corn soup! Surely, this will help remedy what ails him."
56,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_HUNGRYPELUPELU05040_000_014","Hm? That soup will help me feel better?"
57,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_HUNGRYPELUPELU05040_000_015","Oho! A <Emphasis>corn</Emphasis> soup! It really is the best of foods─I can't get enough of it. I never thought eating only corn could be bad for me, but there's no denying how terrible I've been feeling lately."
58,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_HUNGRYPELUPELU05040_000_016","I suppose I'll need to be more creative with my corn cooking. Thanks for this. You've given me much to think about."
59,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_CORNSERVANT_000_020","Nothing like a nice, warm corn soup to warm the belly and the heart."
60,"TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_CORNSERVANT_000_021","Let this be a reminder, my friend─it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Even corn!"
