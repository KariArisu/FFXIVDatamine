49,"TEXT_KINGZA001_05017_TURALWARRIOR05017_000_002","It's time for patrol, and my partner is nowhere to be seen! I'd handle it myself, but I could miss his arrival were I to leave my post."
50,"TEXT_KINGZA001_05017_TURALWARRIOR05017_000_003","Knowing him, he's lost in conversation somewhere in Brightploom Post. Just look for the Boonewa with the big eyes and dark blue scales. When you find him, tell him his partner is waiting for him."
51,"TEXT_KINGZA001_05017_TURALWARRIOR05017_000_004","He must've forgotten it's time for our patrol. Remember, he's the Boonewa with big eyes and dark blue scales─you can't miss him!"

55,"TEXT_KINGZA001_05017_MAMOOLJAWARRIORB05017_000_013","Ah, no, I am a Hoobigo. Boonewa don't have long combs like ours, you see. They're most commonly identified by the hue of their scales."

57,"TEXT_KINGZA001_05017_MAMOOLJAWARRIORC05017_000_015","Then again, patience has never been his strong suit... In any case, thank you for letting me know. I suppose I'll head over early, just to be nice."
