49,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_POORMERCHANT05035_000_001","The Pelupelu boy I hired as a guide to show me around these parts gave me one look before suddenly heading north, muttering something as he left."
50,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_POORMERCHANT05035_000_002","He was speaking too quickly for me to catch what was said, but I fear the mere sight of me upset him somehow."
51,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_POORMERCHANT05035_000_003","If it wouldn't be too much trouble, would you go and offer him an apology on my behalf? He ran off toward the tea field north of here, but if there's no sign of him, I'm sure someone nearby would have seen where he went."
52,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_POORMERCHANT05035_000_005","I'm quite certain he was heading toward the tea field north of here, but don't hesitate to ask around if there's no sign of him. Someone has to have seen him."
53,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_GORPLI_000_010","Did I see anyone pass by this way recently? Why yes, actually─the local guide."
54,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_GORPLI_000_011","He was gathering fresh tea leaves here just moments ago, until a rather rambunctious alpaca did something to agitate him."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_GORPLI_000_012","I couldn't hold back a chortle as he chased after it. I fear he may've heard... Ahem. At any rate, he was headed towards the hill northwest of here."
56,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_GORPLI_000_015","You'll most likely find him, and perhaps that overly playful alpaca, on the hill northwest of here."
57,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_IMPATIENTPELUPELU05035_000_020","Hmm? Who are you and what do you want? If you haven't noticed, I'm rather busy at present!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_IMPATIENTPELUPELU05035_000_021","Upset? Me? Why would he...? Ah, I was speaking too fast again. An unfortunate misunderstanding."
59,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_IMPATIENTPELUPELU05035_000_022","That merchant has a clear case of altitude sickness. It's not uncommon in those traveling to Urqopacha for the first time."
60,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_IMPATIENTPELUPELU05035_000_023","The best cure for it─and most things─is mate tea, which is why I was collecting tea leaves earlier. But just as I'd finished packing them into my bag, this wild alpaca came and snatched it! Now that I have it back, it's time to get brewing!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_IMPATIENTPELUPELU05035_000_027","Yes, drink it up!"
62,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_POORMERCHANT05035_000_030","There you are! He told me everything, and it seems I mistakenly sent you on a wild alpaca chase. Forgive me. Thanks to his tea, I'm feeling much better."
63,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_IMPATIENTPELUPELU05035_000_032","Mate tea is a vital source of nutrients in these highlands! I'm sure you can promote it as a nourishing potable back in the markets of Tuliyollal. Why not buy some in bulk now?"
64,"TEXT_KINGZB006_05035_POORMERCHANT05035_000_034","Ha, you're not only a talented guide but a convincing salesman! Very well, I'll give your offer some thought. But first, might we continue our tour?"
