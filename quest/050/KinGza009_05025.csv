49,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_002","Ah, that reminds me. You'll have to forgive the impertinence, but there just so happens to be a matter I could use your help with... I'm researching Turali ecosystems, and I'm currently on the hunt for one creature in particular."
50,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_003","In truth, I'd barely set foot on land before I made my discovery. Alas, as I was trying to secure the specimen for study, it got away from me..."
51,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_004","It has a somewhat...peculiar cry, to say the least. The creature itself is covered in tawny brown fur and is rather small in stature. The strangest thing is, I asked some of the locals whether they had heard of such an animal, and they seemed quite baffled!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_005","You don't happen to know of the creature I speak of, do you?"

56,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_A1_000_003","I'm just as baffled as the locals. Never heard of such a creature."

58,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_006","You've laid eyes on the creature!? And a valiant hero such as yourself is in awe of its ferocity? Why, I must get my hands on it at all costs!"

60,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_008","It's surprising that one so well traveled would not have come across the creature. Which suggests that it is indeed a rare specimen of the highest order─and thus science demands it be captured and studied!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_009","Aha! You mean to discern the animal's habitat and mannerisms by imitating its cry? Quite remarkable. It seems I'm in the presence of a budding naturalist! Well, I shan't be outshone in my own field! The creature must be captured!"
62,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_010","I shall conduct an extensive search of the port, which is where I first saw the creature. Might I ask you to search the high ground─the residential district known as the Resplendent Quarter?"
63,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_011","I shall continue my search in the vicinity. Now that I think of it, the creature itself may have come here from foreign shores..."

85,"TEXT_KINGZA009_05025_SCHOLAR05025_000_043","This is just what I need! If I can work this discovery into a paper, it will do wonders for my standing within the faculty─and put me one step closer to that tenured position!"
