Movamuq fears for the safety of her missing potsworn."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SEQ_01","Anfroy is missing, but Movamuq knows a means by which he might be found─following the graven arrows he once scratched into the walls of Earthenshire to escape the village unnoticed. It falls to you to seek out these arrows, and by them, Anfroy.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SEQ_02","You find an arrow on the outer wall of the village. It points towards the northwest, where the next in the sequence is presumably placed."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SEQ_03","You find a second arrow, which directs you out of the village to the west, into the Glostfired Bank. You head out to try to pick up Anfroy's trail."
4,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SEQ_04","You find Anfroy surrounded by hungry beasts, and cut them down moments before their jaws close around the terrified trinketmaker. Hopefully he remains none the worse for wear."
5,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SEQ_05","Anfroy thanks you for saving his life. He reveals that he was making his way to the Cracked Cistern in order to craft Movamuq's present when the fiends waylaid him, and asks that you meet him there."
6,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SEQ_06","In the Cracked Cistern, Anfroy gets to work crafting his farewell gift to Movamuq, though he fears how well she will receive it now that she knows of his unauthorized abscondment. He asks that you return to Earthenshire ahead of him, to put his helphand's concerns to bed."
7,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SEQ_07","Back in Earthenshire, Anfroy and Movamuq exchange their gifts, together with words of both gratitude and vitriol. Though their potpact is approaching its end, they will continue to bear the respect they share for each other in their hearts, and pass these feelings on to those who follow in their footsteps."

50,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_A1_000_100","Perhaps he just needed some space to think."

54,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_MOVAMUQ_000_002","Once, Anfroy played a craftytrick on everymobbie. He carved little arrows around Earthenshire that showed the potsworn how to sneakyslip away to his secret hideyplace without helphands eyecatching them."
55,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_MOVAMUQ_000_003","If Anfroy has sneakyslipped to that same hideyplace, you just have to eyecatch the arrows! Please, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, search for tinysize arrows around Earthenshire and find Anfroy!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_MOVAMUQ_000_010","There are lots of hungryguts monsters outside the potwalls. If anything happens to Anfroy, Movamuq will be forever shamefaced. Please, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, find arrows, and find Anfroy!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SYSTEM_000_030","You strain your eyes at a scratch on the wall and discover that it is in fact three scratches, clustered in a small yet distinct arrow shape. It appears to be directing you along the wall, toward the northwest."

59,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SYSTEM_000_040","You find what looks like some old graffiti. The symbols are too weathered to read, but as best as you can make out, none of them were ever an arrow."
60,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SYSTEM_000_050","You find an arrow pointing out of the village toward the west. This must be the direction in which Anfroy left Earthenshire."
61,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_SYSTEM_000_055","You find some old graffiti that reads “MovaMUCK's a miser!” Perhaps it was written by Anfroy in his younger years?"

63,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_ANFROY_000_070","Thank you so much! It would have been a cruel twist of fate to be murdered by monsters just a few days before my retirement."
64,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_ANFROY_000_071","I took this path to avoid being spotted by the Moblins, only to get spotted by something far, far worse. It's a roundabout route to the Cracked Cistern─a community of artisans, mostly those who used to work in Earthenshire before they ended their contracts. "
65,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_ANFROY_000_072","Seemed like the perfect place to make Movamuq's present without her finding out. Come with me, and I'll thank you properly once we're safe behind its gates."

68,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_ROSTAND_000_101","Don't listen to a word he says. If I ever had any real talent, it withered long ago. That's the reason you find me here rather than in Earthenshire."
69,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_ROSTAND_000_102","Crafting's best left to the true masters of the art, I say. That's why I'm letting Anfroy here use my workshop to make his gift for Movamuq."
70,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_ANFROY_000_103","I don't know if it's a good idea anymore, though... I was hoping she'd never find out that I left the village, but now that she has, she's going to be furious. "
71,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_ANFROY_000_104","Movamuq's done so much for me over the years, but all I've ever given her is headaches... Will this gift be enough to make up for all of that?"

78,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_ANFROY_000_120","Well, even if she is angry with me, it wouldn't be the first time. All our years working together, that's been our way─she nags me, I fob her off with my work. Fitting that it should end the same."
79,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_ANFROY_000_121","I'll be done with the present soon enough. Would you mind heading back to Earthenshire before me? Let Movamuq know that I'm safe and well, and I'll be home soon."

83,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_MOVAMUQ_000_151","But no time for puzzlethinking─she needs to finish craftymaking her byegift! When Anfroy backwalks to Earthenshire, we will have plentytime for giftgiving and grumblywords!"
84,"TEXT_KINGZC304_05088_MOVAMUQ_000_200","...How many times must we trade lipflaps on this, Anfroy? You must not leave the potwall alone! Wildplace is dangerplace!"
