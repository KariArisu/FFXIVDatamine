Movamuq is ready to roadsmash."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_SEQ_01","Movamuq informs you that the crafting material she requires to complete Anfroy's leaving gift can be found near Many Fires, to the east of Earthenshire, before running as fast as her legs will carry her to that very place.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_SEQ_02","You meet with Movamuq by the aetheryte of Many Fires. She had ordered a length of leather cord from her usual supplier in Tuliyollal, but its delivery was delayed by the storm, leaving her with little option but to craft it herself. To this end, she asks you to slay one of the tegus that make their home in the Dewspun Bank, and bring her back its hide."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_SEQ_03","You slay a tegu and flay its skin. Satisfied with your work, you return to Movamuq who eagerly awaits your return."
4,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_SEQ_04","Movamuq studies your tegu hide and declares it perfectly suited for her needs. The gathertask done, you return to Earthenshire to begin the craftytask."
5,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_SEQ_05","On returning to Earthenshire, you find Movamuq in a blind panic. Anfroy is missing, and she knows not whither or wherefore he has gone."

49,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_MOVAMUQ_000_010","Ready, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Then let the gathertask begin! Our aimplace is Many Fires, over the river to the east. Let us meet there, and Movamuq will mindshare more."
50,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_MOVAMUQ_000_020","Hail, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Let us be fastacting. The craftstuff Movamuq asked Tarnotik to collect was steelstrong hidestring. Movamuq ordered it specialwise from stuffsender in Tuliyollal."
51,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_MOVAMUQ_000_021","Littleluck, stuffsender's wheelywagon was upheld by the storm. Only way to get hidestring now is to make it mobbieself─but for that, Movamuq will need goodhide."

55,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_MOVAMUQ_000_060","Oh, yes! This is goodhide! Very good goodhide! Even Movamuq can make good hidestring from this."
56,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_MOVAMUQ_000_061","Movamuq is not a mastermaker like Anfroy, but she has some small craftyskill herself. She will pour her airyself into it, to show her thankyfeels for all his years of craftymaking!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_MOVAMUQ_000_062","It is very rare for crafthands to end their potpacts due to longyears, you know. Every year, we bid byewords to a few crafthands─those who want a scenechange, or who no longer need mobbiehelp, or who suffer from homesadness."
58,"TEXT_KINGZC303_05087_MOVAMUQ_000_063","Not Anfroy, though. He withstuck us to the end, hardly ever lipslipping a moanword. It has been Movamuq's longhonor to be his helphand."
