You happen upon a curious cob of corn that almost seems alive."
1,"TEXT_KINGZA004_05020_SEQ_01","You speak with the curious cob of corn, which you discover is an ancient spirit that refers to itself as the Cornservant. Forgotten and lost to time, the Cornservant feared it would fade away completely. Your presence, however, has given the jubilant cob renewed hope. It longs to nourish the hearts and bellies of Tuliyollal, and with your help, they believe their purpose can be fulfilled.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZA004_05020_SEQ_02","The Cornservant asks that you accompany them about the city. Should you find any hungry citizens in need of both physical and spiritual nourishment, the Cornservant will provide food taken from their own cob to feed them."
3,"TEXT_KINGZA004_05020_SEQ_03","You find three hungry citizens on your walk about Tuliyollal, and to each one the Cornservant offers a perfectly grilled corn on the cob. With these acts of kindness complete, the Cornservant appears satisfied with a job well done."
4,"TEXT_KINGZA004_05020_SEQ_04","The Cornservant can hear no more bellies in need of filling, its kernels swelling with joy. They wish to offer you a proper thanks, and so invites you over to the Arch of the Dawn."
5,"TEXT_KINGZA004_05020_SEQ_05","Though the bellies of Tuliyollal are filled, there are other hungry souls in the world that cry out for sustenance. The Cornservant would answer their calls, but not before offering you a small token of appreciation─corn fresh from their own cob."
