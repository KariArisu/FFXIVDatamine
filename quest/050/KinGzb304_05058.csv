Murfurlur has finally drummed up the courage to start his new career."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB304_05058_SEQ_01","The time has come for Murfurlur to seek out a client, and he would like you to bear witness to his efforts. As Pelupelu fishermen sometimes pass through Worlar's Echo on their way to Karvarhur the First, the Yok Huy believes that one might be willing to hire on a bodyguard. You can only hope that his assumption proves correct.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB304_05058_SEQ_02","As luck would have it, there is indeed a fisher who is glad of the opportunity to employ a Yok Huy protector. Worried that he may fall short in his duties, Murfurlur asks that you join him as he stands watch over his new client on the shore of Karvarhur the First."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB304_05058_SEQ_03","Upon your arrival, you see that Murfurlur has already had to deal with an unusually aggressive creature. For extra reassurance, he would have you trail him and the fisher, keeping watch for potential threats from behind."
4,"TEXT_KINGZB304_05058_SEQ_04","The morbol seedling which catches your eye bodes ill enough on its own, but the bloodcurdling scream you hear a moment later is far more concerning. Given that it sounded like the Pelupelu fisherman and came from Karvarhur the First, it stands to reason that Murfurlur and his client are in trouble..."
5,"TEXT_KINGZB304_05058_SEQ_05","For a mercy, you arrive in time to dispatch a morbol before it can harm the fisher. With the immediate danger having passed, you turn your attention to the injured Murfurlur."
6,"TEXT_KINGZB304_05058_SEQ_06","Despite Murfurlur's thoughts to the contrary, the Pelupelu praises him for a job well done. With peace restored─albeit temporarily─the fisher declares it time to settle in and fill his bucket before the opportunity is lost."
7,"TEXT_KINGZB304_05058_SEQ_07","Satisfied with his haul, the Pelupelu fisherman heads back to Worlar's Echo. With no reason to stay, you and Murfurlur follow his lead."
8,"TEXT_KINGZB304_05058_SEQ_08","For as great an honor as it was to guard Karryorzar the Gracious, deep down Murfurlur yearned to protect not a place, but the people. Having completed his first bodyguard commission, Murfurlur reaffirms this passion, naming himself Murfurlur the Defender─a friend to the weak and vulnerable who will do everything in his power to build a stronger relationship with the Pelupelu."
