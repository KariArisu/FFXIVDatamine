Movamuq is ready to move on."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_SEQ_01","Following Anfroy's retirement, Movamuq finds herself temporarily without an artisan to assist, and so turns her attentions to the fielding of commissions for new pieces. It emerges that the patron patiently awaiting her presence at Many Fires is none other than your friend Nahanshe, so you go together to greet him.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_SEQ_02","Nahanshe explains that he has gathered all the materials needed to revitalize the Landsguard's uniforms, but their chief armorer has succumbed to an untimely injury. Thus has he been tasked with seeking the services of the artisan who originally designed and constructed the uniforms. Movamuq believes that said artisan now resides in the Cracked Cistern, and suggests you all go there to convince him to return from retirement."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_SEQ_03","At the Cracked Cistern, Anfroy reveals that you have already met the artisan in question: it is his old friend Rostand, the man who previously lent Anfroy his workshop. Movamuq fears he will refuse if she asks, but perhaps the famed artisan can be persuaded by you and Anfroy."
4,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_SEQ_04","Though Rostand is reluctant to make the long journey to Tuliyollal, you convince him to make the shorter one to Ok'hanu, where you are sure your friends among the Hanuhanu will facilitate both the delivery of materials from the capital, and a suitable environment in which to work. You return to Nahanshe to seek his acceptance of this compromise."
5,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_SEQ_05","Nahanshe gladly accepts the proposal, and urges you go to Ok'hanu to seek Lanuhanu's approval. So sure is he that it will be granted, Nahanshe makes for Tuliyollal, to arrange the transport of all the necessary materials."
6,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_SEQ_06","With a little help from an adventurer's expert eye, Rostand rediscovers his confidence in his craft, and reconstructs the Landsguard's armor down to the minutest detail. In the fires of Rostand's forge are the bonds of friendship forged─between the artisan himself, the Landsguard, the Moblins, and the Hanuhanu. Anfroy stands ready to offer you his congratulations for the role you played in this."
7,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_SEQ_07","Anfroy thanks you for your role in bridging the gap between Tuliyollal and the Cracked Cistern, Ok'hanu and Earthenshire. It is to the latter that he must return, to finish packing for his own journey across the many-faceted jewel that is Tural. A jewel that is ever being polished to a more glorious sheen by the efforts of selfless souls such as yourself."

55,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_NAHANSHE_000_051","Since last we met, the Landsguard sent me the length and breadth of Tural, seeking out a hundred different materials that go into making our uniforms."

60,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ANFROY_000_060","I was just about to set off on my travels when Movamuq barrels back into town and demands I help her with one last task. Do you know what this is all about?"
61,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_NAHANSHE_000_065","I read about this place. It's a community for retired artisans. Oh, don't tell me the one I'm looking for has already laid down his tools?"
62,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_MOVAMUQ_000_080","Anfroy tells Movamuq that the crafthand who thinkybuilt the Landsguard's uniforms is a man named Rostand."
63,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_MOVAMUQ_000_081","Rostand is an armormaker from across the wetplain─one with such craftyskill that the Dawnservant gave him the asktask selfwise!"
64,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_MOVAMUQ_000_082","But some years ago, he said that his craftyskill had started to offdrop, so he ended his potpact and moved out here."

69,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_NAHANSHE_000_100","The Landsguard were inaugurated soon after Tuliyollal's founding, but that was decades ago. If this Rostand character designed our armor way back when, he must be ancient now."
70,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_120","Anfroy told me what you're after. I'm sorry to have to disappoint, but these old hands of mine don't work like they used to. A lifetime of working metal takes its toll."
71,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_121","I'm too tired and too frail to be journeying all the way to Tuliyollal. I doubt I'd even make it there in one piece."
72,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ANFROY_000_122","It is a long journey, and a hard one. We could ask the Landsguard to haul all the materials here instead, but that wouldn't make it any easier for them."
73,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ANFROY_000_123","They'd have to organize boats, and punutiys, and porters...and it would likely take more than a single trip. Any ideas how we could ease the burden on both sides? Some way we could...meet in the middle?"

77,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ANFROY_000_125","That could work. Ok'hanu's not far, and it has a boat landing. No need for Rostand to risk the rapids, nor for the Landsguard to haul all those heavy crates to the top of the falls and beyond. If we can convince the Hanuhanu to let us set up a workshop there, it could be the answer...but can we?"
78,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_126","Your friend here seems confident enough. Well, if the Hanuhanu and the Landsguard are both willing to make that concession..."
79,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_127","...it'd be churlish of me to refuse it. I can't promise you my best work, but I'll give you what I can."

83,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_MOVAMUQ_000_140","Movamuq will handhelp however she can, if armorcrafter will say happywords!"
84,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_NAHANSHE_000_150","...That sounds like a perfect compromise! I doubt my colleagues in the Landsguard would balk at the arrangement, but I should probably check before making any promises I can't keep."
85,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_NAHANSHE_000_151","Meanwhile, I expect Movamuq will need to set up the workshop. It looks like talking to Lanuhanu about it is a job for you!"
86,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_LANUHANU_000_180","To think that a master craftsman should seek to establish his workshop here in Ok'hanu. We are as surprised as we are gratified!"

93,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_202","The Landsguard uniforms come in a few different flavors, so I was thinking I'd first make a sample of each. Starting with yours, Nahanshe: the peacekeeper's uniform."
94,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_203","Hmmm... It's <Emphasis>close</Emphasis> to what I remember designing back in the day, but is it really the same? What do you think?"

98,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_212","Y-You really think so? Well, if a fighter like you thinks it'll serve, I'll trust your judgment over mine."
99,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_213","A suit of armor can be pretty as a picture, but so long as it doesn't protect its wearer's life, it's little more than a painted funeral shroud.

100,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_214","The first few models, all he left was ash. It hurt my heart to see my creations so thoroughly laid to waste, but I soon learned... Anyway, onto the next pattern."

107,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_227","It warms my heart to hear you say it. You're right─each uniform embodies a different aspect of Kixaihih, so it's natural each should present a different face."
108,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_228","Kixaihih isn't represented in one uniform alone, nor even in them all combined. Only a fool would think he could capture every aspect of the divine. The best you can hope for is to find a way to imitate it, through trial and error."
109,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_229","And thanks to your support, I'm starting to feel as if I've done just that. To remember how it felt to happen upon these designs so many years ago. Let's see if I can repeat the trick one more time..."
110,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_230","You're right. Of course, you're right. I was a fool to think I could recapture the past. I'm a shadow of the artisan I once was..."
111,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_240","And that's the last of the lot. I gave it my all, but was it enough?"

113,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_A1_000_401","I want a set for myself!"
114,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_A2_000_402","I think the Landsguard will need more than one set of each."
115,"TEXT_KINGZC401_05089_ROSTAND_000_245","You honor me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. These uniforms are for the Landsguard, but the crafting method is no great secret. I'm sure they wouldn't begrudge you wearing one in solidarity."
