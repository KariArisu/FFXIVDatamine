49,"TEXT_KINGZD003_05092_XBRAALGIRL05092_000_001","You see, one of my friends said he was going fishing in a cenote, but hasn't come back for some time. While the right cenote can be quite bountiful, they naturally attract all sorts of hungry beasts. I'm worried something terrible has happened..."

There are also stories of desperate people diving in to avoid capture by the enemy. In both cases, the monstrous fish in Iq Rrax Tsoly feasted, and its waters would be stained red..."
