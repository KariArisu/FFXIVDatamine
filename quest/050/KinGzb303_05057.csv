Murfurlur has been thinking long and hard about how he might best serve others."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_SEQ_01","With your encouragement, Murfurlur has decided to look for work as a bodyguard. He suspects that one of the many traveling Pelupelu merchants would likely have need of protection, but lacks the confidence to approach them in this capacity. And so, to better prepare himself, he asks that you help by training him first. Once you rendezvous with him south of the Shades of Grief, you may proceed with his education.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_SEQ_02","Murfurlur requests that you act as his bodyguard so that he might learn from your example. To that end, you must keep your eyes peeled and protect him from any perceived threats until you reach the ruins at the Shades of Grief.

※You must be accompanied by Murfurlur to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_SEQ_03","You manage to fend off all threats on the way to the Shades of Grief. Murfurlur will only require your escort until you reach the peak."
4,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_SEQ_04","As before, no ferocious beast is a match for your might. Having reached the zenith of the Shades of Grief, Murfurlur basks in the breathtaking scenery. His gaze, you note, is drawn to the Pelupelu village down below..."
5,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_SEQ_05","Reflecting on the history between his people and the Pelupelu, Murfurlur expresses guilt and trepidation at the thought of how he might live on in the memories of his neighbors. Though he aspires to be a gentle guardian, he is aware that the Pelupelu elders will not soon forget the dark deeds of the Yok Huy─nor should they. Your training session complete, he heads back to Worlar's Echo and invites you to follow."
6,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_SEQ_06","Murfurlur believes that, through his new ambition, he has the power to show the Pelupelu that the Yok Huy of the present are not the same as their ancestors. He hopes that he can continue to rely on you for support as he searches for a new client."

49,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_001","It seems I have no choice but to beg the boon of your wisdom once more. Have you any ideas?"

51,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_A1_000_001","Try asking around at another village."
52,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_A1_000_002","Perhaps you could look for work as a bodyguard."

54,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_002","Our closest neighbors are the Pelupelu of Wachunpelo. Hmm...yes, perhaps the little ones would have need of a protector."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_003","Ah, yes, that would suit my strengths. As for who might have need of protection..."
56,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_100_003","I take it you would have me solve this conundrum on my own. Well then, as a former guardian of Karryorzar the Gracious, perhaps I could serve as someone's protector... Someone small and weak..."
57,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_004","Come to think of it, there are no few traveling Pelupelu merchants who employ bodyguards to defend them from beasts and bandits."
58,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_005","However, I am unaccustomed to dealing with their kind and lack the confidence to approach them─especially given my unfamiliarity with this profession."
59,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_006","Therefore, while it pains me to impose upon your goodwill once more...would you be willing to train me in the ways of the bodyguard?"
60,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_007","If so, I ask that you join me just outside the village, on the path to the Shades of Grief."
61,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_010","I thank you for joining me. Now, while I am no stranger to battle, I have only ever guarded a sanctum, not an individual."
62,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_011","Therefore, I propose that you act as my bodyguard that I may learn from your example. We will together travel this road to the Shades of Grief."

65,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_SYSTEM_000_014","Escort Murfurlur to the Shades of Grief. Should you fail to defend him, or move too far away, he will return to the starting position, where you may rendezvous with him before trying again."
66,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_BALLOON_000_015","I am sure to learn much from this."

72,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_SYSTEM_000_035","You survey the area, but there are no imminent threats as far as you can see."
73,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_040","There are a great many elements to consider. Maintaining awareness of my client and our surroundings─particularly potential avenues of attack─all while keeping a brisk pace. In contrast, standing watch over a frozen vidraal was far less complicated."
74,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_041","Perhaps you wonder why I chose this place for our destination. Look below─the Pelupelu village is within sight."
75,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_042","Our homes were once connected by a mountain road. When we were their oppressors."
76,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_043","Until Gulool Ja Ja put an end to the practice, we demanded yearly tribute, and in exchange granted them our “protection.”"

81,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_051","As a Yok Huy warrior, I have the power to show the Pelupelu that we are not our ancestors─that we can offer them peace and protection as equals, not conquerors. I only hope they will prove amenable."
82,"TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_MURFURLUR_000_052","That said, I cannot begin to pursue this goal until such time as I find a client. That search begins now!"
