Nopli appears to be in deep thought."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_SEQ_01","To teach Gigimolu the error of his ways, Nopli would give the Ul'dahn merchant a taste of their own deception. To see the deed done, he asks that you speak with people in Wachunpelo, and determine what specialties might garner Gigimolu's interest.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_SEQ_02","After speaking with a number of individuals in the settlement, you narrow down your options to either an uolon bristle hairbrush or a traditional Pelupelu doll. Nopli is certain to be interested in your selections."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_SEQ_03","Nopli believes the uolon bristle hairbrush will best serve as bait for his plan. If all goes as it should, Gigimolu will at last come to understand the importance of a fair trade."

57,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_013","It's a bit of a conundrum, isn't it? But from my perspective, such a conclusion would be troubling. After all, we'd lose one of the few merchants willing to voyage across the seas to do business with us. "
58,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_014","If he is to remain a potential trading partner in the years to come, he needs to be made to see the error of his ways."
59,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_015","I suspect a few words of warning will do little, however. He needs to be taught a proper lesson, to feel the sting of being swindled for himself. And we shall make sure that he does─the Pelupelu way."
60,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_016","First, we'll need an alluring piece of merchandise to serve as bait. Hailing from across the salt yourself, I can think of none better suited to finding something that might garner his interest."
61,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_017","Have a look about and see what local specialties we have to offer. I should like to know if anything catches your eye. "
62,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_018","I'm sure there's something here that's certain to entice Gigimolu. It's simply a matter of finding it."
63,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_VAPLI_000_020","Hmm, if you're looking for something out of the ordinary, I'd have to recommend an uolon bristle hairbrush."
64,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_VAPLI_000_021","They're good to keep the alpacas free of fleas, and they help prevent skin conditions, among other things. And while you'd expect them to turn and spit on anyone tugging on their hair, the alpacas seem to enjoy the grooming. It's a simple way to help keep them healthy and happy."
65,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_VAPLI_000_022","People can use the brushes too, obviously. The uolon bristles help distribute natural scalp oils, and strip the hair of leftover dead strands to promote a healthy scalp. It's surprisingly gentle on the skin, too, so it's little wonder they've grown so popular."
66,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_PELUPELUPOPOTO05053_000_023","A local specialty that's on the rarer side? How about the popotoes being sold at the distillery? It's one of the few vegetables that can be cultivated at these altitudes!"
67,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_PELUPELUPOPOTO05053_000_024","Oh, you already have popotoes aplenty in Eorzea? Hah, well I'll be! If they're popular across the salt as well, I couldn't be prouder! "
68,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_QOBLI_000_025","Something rare? I can think of nothing better than coffee plants. They'd surely fetch a handsome price, seeing as you most likely can't find them where you're from."
69,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_QOBLI_000_026","Oh, so you <Emphasis>can</Emphasis> find them there! Well in that case, I'd like to try your coffee for myself!"
70,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_PELUPELUDOLL05053_000_027","If it's for a merchant, they might be interested in our traditional dolls. They're believed to be good luck for business. I carry one around myself, as it so happens."
71,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_PELUPELUDOLL05053_000_028","Whether or not someone unaware of its origins and significance will truly appreciate it is another question entirely..."
72,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_SYSTEM_000_029","Popotoes and coffee plants do not seem like bait enticing enough to draw Gigimolu's interest. The doll and hairbrush, on the other hand, may just be tantalizing enough. Report back to Nopli and inform him of your findings."
73,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_VAPLI_000_030","I'd have to recommend an uolon bristle hairbrush. In recent days, the brushes have gained some popularity among folk who are fussy about their hair."
74,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_PELUPELUPOPOTO05053_000_031","To think popotoes have become so commonplace beyond Tural! I wonder how people across the salt cook 'em..."
75,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_QOBLI_000_032","Oh, what I would give for even a sip of coffee from across the salt!"
76,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_PELUPELUDOLL05053_000_033","These dolls are of great importance and value both to we Pelupelu. Perhaps the merchant will be interested in purchasing one for himself."
77,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_040","You are returned! I take it you found an item or two of interest?"
78,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_041","I see... An uolon bristle hairbrush, and one of our traditional dolls. I must admit, whether such a doll would truly be desirable to an outsider is a bit dubious."
79,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_042","I think it'd be safest to go with the hairbrush. My thanks for finding a suitable bait."
80,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_043","Normally, they go for one pel in the ten thousands column, but to teach our pernicious peddler a lesson, I'll offer him one for one pel in the <Emphasis>hundred thousands</Emphasis> column!"
81,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_044","Lest you worry, I won't actually sell it to him. I'm just giving him a taste of his own medicine, so he can come to understand why a fair and honest deal is so important to we Pelupelu."
82,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_100_044","More importantly... I wish to convey something to him, merchant to merchant. So, what do you say? Will you lend me your aid?"

84,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_045","Thank you! Let's give Gigimolu an offer he can't refuse!"
85,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_100_045","I understand. Even if it's for a just cause, you don't want to deceive anyone. But I don't see any other way to make Gigimolu understand the shortsightedness of his actions. If you change your mind, I'll be here, waiting for you."
86,"TEXT_KINGZB203_05053_NOPLI_000_046","Gigimolu needs to understand what he's doing is wrong. Please say you'll help me."
