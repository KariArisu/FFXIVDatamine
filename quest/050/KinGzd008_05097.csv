52,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_XAXILYIK_000_021","You're here in that merchant's stead? Well, it's all the same to me, so go ahead and take this equipment, modeled after that used by the Landsguard. I reckon it'll suffice for his “samples.”"
53,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_XAXILYIK_000_022","And you tell him something for me. Tell him that he's ordering too much."
54,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_XAXILYIK_000_023","This place wasn't intended to make more than is needed by Iq Br'aax. That being said, I'm confident that what I'm giving him is of the highest quality."
55,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_XAXILYIK_000_024","Well, go on then. And don't you forget to deliver my message."
56,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_XAXILYIK_000_025","You have what you need, and now I'm sure you're eager to get paid."

58,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_BOLINEN_000_032","Also, be sure to pass on my apologies that I could not meet the uh...vast quantity he requested. We are a self-sufficient people, you see, and do not produce goods with a mind to sell them en masse."
59,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_BOLINEN_000_034","Still, I hope what I've provided meets with his satisfaction. Be well."

61,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_MOTIONSICKNESS05097_000_041","Oh, there you are. I'm feeling much better, in case you were wondering. So, did you bring the samples? I'll have you know, I intend to count every last one of them."
62,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_MOTIONSICKNESS05097_000_042","Ah, beautiful! Thank you for helping this deal go smoothly. As for the quantities...well, it's unfortunate, but I'll take what I can. And I do still intend to count them, you can be sure."
63,"TEXT_KINGZD008_05097_MOTIONSICKNESS05097_000_044","Goods from Iq Br'aax are usually acquired through negotiations with the Xbr'aal. We can only purchase small amounts, and they're usually brought all the way from the village."
