Murfurlur regards you with a mixture of reverence and uncertainty."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_SEQ_01","While Murfurlur has heard of your victory over the Skyruin, he struggles to comprehend how one so small could have triumphed over the legendary vidraal, and so he asks that you favor him with a demonstration of your skill. There have been reports of large monsters threatening all who travel along the road leading to the Shades of Grief, which should prove a suitable challenge. Murfurlur bids you meet him there when you are ready to begin.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_SEQ_02","Prior to your arrival, Murfurlur was attacked by one of the foul beasts, which he defeated easily. There was another, however, which escaped to the southwest, and he tasks you with tracking it down."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_SEQ_03","The huallepen was no match for your might. Hopefully Murfurlur found your display of force educational."
4,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_SEQ_04","Murfurlur could not be more pleased with your performance, which has helped him to understand how you could accomplish such magnificent feats of strength. Now that the threat is no more, you can return to Worlar's Echo and see if he requires anything more of you."
5,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_SEQ_05","It transpires that Murfurlur was a guardian of Karryorzar the Gracious who, following your triumph over Valigarmanda, found himself without purpose, as there was no need for him to stand watch over the temple any longer. He is unsure what new passion he should pursue next, though he is intrigued to learn that you developed your skills over the course of your adventures. You can but hope he will be closer to finding his answer when next you speak."

49,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_001","You protected our land, and for that I, Murfurlur, express my deepest gratitude. I wish only that I could have seen the battle with my own eyes."
50,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_002","As a warrior of the Yok Huy, I cannot fathom how one of your...diminutive stature laid low the fearsome Skyruin. Thus do I ask if you would demonstrate your martial prowess."
51,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_003","I thank you for this honor. Of late, hulking monsters have been sighted south of the Shades of Grief, endangering all who travel along the road."
52,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_004","I bid you snuff out this threat, that I might see for myself how you subdue your foes. I shall go there now─join me when you are prepared."
53,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_010","Glad am I to see you did not lose your way. As for this one, it made the mistake of picking a fight with me."
54,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_011","There was another, but unlike its comrade, it had the good sense to flee. Not far, however. It stalks us from the shadows, yet thirsting for blood."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_012","These beasts are formidable indeed, possessed of strength equal to their keen senses. I would have you hunt down the one that remains."
56,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_013","Follow its tracks to the southwest. Doubtless it will reveal itself to what it will see as a smaller, less challenging foe."
57,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_020","The beast fled to the southwest, but hunger will compel it to strike again. Show me how you overcome the disadvantage of your size."
58,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_021","Impressive, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Not once did you falter before the towering huallepen. Quick to react and adapt you were indeed."
59,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_022","Yes, I have seen all that I needed to see. Now that the threat is no more, let us return to Worlar's Echo."
60,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_030","This has been an enlightening experience for me. Not often am I granted the chance to witness a warrior whose skill far surpasses my own."
61,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_031","For years I served as guardian of Karryorzar the Gracious, watching over the seal placed upon Valigarmanda."
62,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_032","I would have aided in the Feat of Ice, too, had the Skyruin not rendered our plans meaningless."
63,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_033","You see, it is the duty of the temple guardians to drive off the dangerous creatures drawn to Valigarmanda's energies."
64,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_034","At times, it was all we could do to shield the frozen vidraal from swarms upon swarms of beasts."
65,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_035","But now that Valigarmanda has been laid low, we guardians have nothing left to guard..."
66,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_036","Of course, this is cause for celebration. Urqopacha─nay, all of Tural─need no longer fear the Skyruin's destruction."
67,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_037","And yet...a part of me felt otherwise. Deprived of purpose, I relinquished my position."
68,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
69,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_A1_000_001","Because we killed Valigarmanda?"

71,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_A1_000_003","Personally, I wouldn't mind if someone made my job unnecessary..."
72,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_038","Oh, I did not mean to suggest I blame you for my woes. Were it not for you, I would surely not be standing here to bemoan my plight!"
73,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_039","No one else is to blame for my feelings of inadequacy. It is something I must work to overcome."
74,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_040","I gather those around you are not inclined to let your talents go to waste. I understand the desire to rest from time to time, though."
75,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_041","At any rate, I thought seeing you in action might move me to seek my next passion, or at the very least, provide inspiration for a new combat technique."

77,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_043","I would also be remiss not to praise your economy of movement. Always thinking ahead, looking for the shortest route to victory."
78,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_044","What calling has led you to develop such commendable skills?"
79,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_045","Ah, so you are an adventurer. Does that mean your life's purpose is the pursuit of adventure? How intriguing."
80,"TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_MURFURLUR_000_046","Alas, much as I would love to hear your many tales, I will not keep you. When next you have a moment, however, it would be my honor to speak with you at length."
