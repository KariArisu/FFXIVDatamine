You could swear the Cornservant was beaming at the sight of you."
1,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_SEQ_01","The Cornservant is both delighted and relieved to see you. A hungry Xbr'aal drew them to this village, and still unable to convey their message of corn and cheer, the Cornservant asks that you accompany them to see the villager is fed.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_SEQ_02","The Xbr'aal youth aspires to become strong much like you. His path to growth has been impeded, however, by his inability to stomach the meat his family insists he try to eat. The Cornservant quickly surmises the situation calls for a filling food suitable to a weaker constitution, and so they conjure a delightful corn porridge. The youth is grateful for the dish, realizing now that there are other dietary means to reach his goal."
3,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_SEQ_03","Thanks to your timely assistance, yet another kind soul has been set on a corn-paved path to betterment. Meaning the time has come for the Cornservant to walk down another in search of more bellies in need of nourishment."

49,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_CORNSERVANT_000_002","Unfortunately, there is at least one Xbr'aal here who is not well, and so I am come to offer them succor and sustenance. Alas, my words yet lack the strength to reach them."
50,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_CORNSERVANT_000_003","Might I prevail upon you to help them in my stead? They're right this way."
51,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_CORNSERVANT_000_005","There is something peculiar about the growl of his stomach that troubles me."
52,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_HUNGRYXBRAAL05099_000_010","Say, you're the companion of the Third Promise, aren't you? I've heard tell of your great strength and valor."
53,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_HUNGRYXBRAAL05099_000_011","Though I aspire to do great things much like you, I fear I've not the stomach for it. Quite literally, in fact. My family is constantly telling me I must eat meat if I'm to build my strength, but my stomach protests every attempt. I simply cannot digest it."
54,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_CORNSERVANT_000_012","A sensitive stomach, is it? <rustle> What he requires is something filling and nutritious, yet suitable for a delicate constitution. I need but take a generous helping of my corn, raise it to a gentle boil, and...there! This corn porridge should do nicely."
55,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_HUNGRYXBRAAL05099_000_013","A porridge made from corn?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_HUNGRYXBRAAL05099_000_014","Even my stomach should be able to handle such a dish, and it looks quite delicious. Thank you."
57,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_HUNGRYXBRAAL05099_000_015","Everyone was so insistent that I find a way to consume meat, I never gave thought to alternatives to build up my strength. You've given me much to think about."
58,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_CORNSERVANT_000_020","<rustle> It is well that his stomach is amenable to my corn-based cuisine."
59,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_CORNSERVANT_000_021","How vexing it must be, struggling to eat food knowing full well it disagrees with you, and ultimately having little to show for your efforts."
60,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_CORNSERVANT_000_022","But by adjusting his diet, he may yet find his own path. That it should be potentially paved with corn makes it all the sweeter, I say."
61,"TEXT_KINGZD010_05099_CORNSERVANT_000_023","<rustle> Speaking of paths, I must follow mine elsewhere, for the clarion call of hungry bellies beckons once more. Stay well, and stay fed."
