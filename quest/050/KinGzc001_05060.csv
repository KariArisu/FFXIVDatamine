The last step is to coat the floors and foundations with resin that protects from water, but there's simply too much work for one pair of claws..."
49,"TEXT_KINGZC001_05060_KANUHANU_000_002","You will help, then? Splendid! We should start by gathering the resin from the trees to the north of Ok'hanu."
50,"TEXT_KINGZC001_05060_KANUHANU_000_003","Then all we have to do is use it to coat the structures in Ok'bek'be to fortify them against the elements."
51,"TEXT_KINGZC001_05060_KANUHANU_000_004","I'll apply resin to the floors after I've made my final repairs, and I ask that you handle the supporting pillars. Afterward, they should withstand the worst the heavens can throw at them."
52,"TEXT_KINGZC001_05060_KANUHANU_000_005","We use the resin from the trees to the north of Ok'hanu to protect our homes. Go there and gather some, then apply a coating to the supporting pillars in Ok'bek'be. "
53,"TEXT_KINGZC001_05060_SYSTEM_000_006","The thick, viscous resin pours slowly into the bottle. Go to Ok'bek'be and coat its supporting pillars with the substance."
54,"TEXT_KINGZC001_05060_KANUHANU_000_007","That was swift work, and well done. The pillars that support our feet are every bit as vital as the reeds which guard our heads. If they are damaged, the very foundation of our lives becomes unsteady."
55,"TEXT_KINGZC001_05060_KANUHANU_000_008","You may have never seen such houses as these, but they're built this way for a reason. In these humid climes, our elevated wooden floors are cooled by the air flowing upward and help keep flood waters from wetting our feet."
56,"TEXT_KINGZC001_05060_KANUHANU_000_009","The white disks on the pillars aren't merely decorative, either─they keep away mice and other small animals. But for all its benefits, wood rots easily, so we must reinforce it or else be stuck in a cycle of constant rebuilding."
57,"TEXT_KINGZC001_05060_KANUHANU_000_010","Thanks to your help, these structures will hopefully still be here for years to come. Take this─a small token of appreciation for your efforts!"
