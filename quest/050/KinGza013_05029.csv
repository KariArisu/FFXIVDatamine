48,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_001","You are one of Vow Wuk Lamat's entourage, yes? How fortuitous. I happen to have a small request for you."
49,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_002","I understand that in Eorzea, you have an organization called the “Adventurers' Guild.” For some time now, the Wing of Reflection has been deliberating on whether to introduce a similar organization here."
50,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_003","The issue is all the more pressing in light of recent events. If the city were to come under attack again, the Landsguard alone may be unable to cope. But before we proceed, we wish to canvass the people of Tuliyollal."
51,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_004","I hear that guilds are often based in locales where residents gather─taverns and eateries and such. I believe Xbalyav Ty'e is a close approximation."
52,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_005","I would ask that you visit Xbalyav Ty'e to discuss the matter with Br'uk Evu and seek his permission to conduct a survey among the patrons."
53,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_006","Pray speak with Br'uk Evu at Xbalyav Ty'e. Once you have his permission, you may begin to canvass some of the patrons."
54,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_BRUKEVU_000_010","...And you say this “Adventurers' Guild” would look to assemble here at Xbalyav Ty'e? Well, we have been getting more foreign patrons of late, and they <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> seem to struggle when it comes to finding guides and swords for hire."
55,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_BRUKEVU_000_011","I suppose this place would be ideal for putting travelers in touch with mercenaries and what have you. Still, you might have a hard time convincing the patrons that they'd benefit from this “guild” you speak of..."
56,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_BRUKEVU_000_012","Anyway, feel free to mingle─just don't make it sound like the palace have already committed to the idea, okay?"
57,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_XAXTEI_000_020","So adventurers would set up shop here at Xbalyav Ty'e? Well, if it means us regular folk can find people willing to solve our problems, I'd be all for it."
58,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_XAXTEI_000_021","Zoraal Ja never seemed to care much about our plight. You could plead all you liked, but the Landsguard would rarely get involved..."
59,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_XAXTEI_000_022","Then again, we've already got the Wing of Protection and Wing of Reflection... We'd likely be better served getting the institutions we <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> have to play their part before we try anything else."
60,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_BEQOLLJA_000_023","I'd be more than happy dealing with adventurers if they were all like you, but if the place was suddenly flooded with boorish sellswords, that's another thing entirely. I'm not looking to tar you all with the same brush, but you know how some of their ilk behave..."
61,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_BEQOLLJA_000_024","Gazing out at the beach, sipping on a glass of something sweet and refreshing─that's what Xbalyav Ty'e is all about! May it never change! "
62,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_TONAKWE_000_025","What need do we have for an organization like that? Vow Wuk Lamat has our interests close at heart. Why, she's often in here, listening to our troubles."
63,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_TONAKWE_000_026","Besides, Br'uk Evu already works hard to make Xbalyav Ty'e a welcoming place for all─foreign visitors included."
64,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_XAXTEI_100_020","I've nothing against the idea, but we already have institutions there to serve us when it comes to such matters..."
65,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_BEQOLLJA_100_021","I can't bear the thought of a bunch of brutish mercenaries ruining the atmosphere here with their bad manners and loutish ways..."
66,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_TONAKWE_100_022","It's a fine idea, but with Vow Wuk Lamat on our side, we commonfolk have no need for this “guild” you speak of."
67,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_030","You spoke with the patrons, yes? Thank you. What did the people of Tuliyollal have to say about the notion of an adventurers' guild?"
68,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_031","I see, I see. You say some patrons would welcome the influx of people willing to aid them, but others were wary of welcoming unsavory characters to Xbalyav Ty'e... A rather more lukewarm response than I'd hoped for."
69,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_032","It seems that first and foremost, there is room for improvement with our current institutions. Besides, the patrons sound rather attached to the Xbalyav Ty'e they know and love."
70,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_033","I have no doubt that an adventurers' guild would flourish here in Tural if only the concept were more familiar. Nevertheless, I fear the time is not yet ripe for such discussions."
71,"TEXT_KINGZA013_05029_CULLAALJA_000_034","Introducing the guild without the necessary groundwork would likely prove counterproductive. For the time being, my colleagues and I will continue our deliberations. Thank you for your assistance, adventurer."
