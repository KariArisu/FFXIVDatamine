49,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_TAPIPYA_000_002","How about runnin' a quick errand for me? By way of thanks, I'll share some of the know-how we local farmers have cultivated over the years."
50,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_TAPIPYA_000_003","Right, it all starts with compost! And that's where you come in. I need your help gettin' a hold o' the makin's that go into the mulch─and you can't go wrong with alpaca manure!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_TAPIPYA_000_004","...No need to look so worried! I'll get the dung delivered from the alpaca stables later. What I want <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> to do is go 'round and collect vegetable scraps for me. I've got an arrangement with some o' the eateries here in Tuliyollal, you see."

54,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_SHOPSTAFF05024_000_010","Did Tapipya send you? I made sure to set aside all the scraps and peelings you need─they're yours for the taking."
55,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_SHOPSTAFF05024_000_011","'Course, there's plenty of traders selling vegetables at Bayside Bevy, but being able to source our produce straight from Seafoam Fields is a real boon for us. Doesn't come much fresher than that, I tell you."
56,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_TIISOLJA_000_012","Tapipya's after his vegetable scraps, is he? Say no more!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_TIISOLJA_000_013","To make a decent taco, you can't cut corners when it comes to meat and spices, but vegetables are just as vital! Mine are packed full of the best produce you can get─and all of it grown by Tapipya himself! We business owners have to look out for one another, after all."
58,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_SHOPSTAFF05024_015","Like I said, there's plenty of folk selling vegetables at Bayside Bevy, but you simply can't beat fresh, locally grown produce."

61,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_TAPIPYA_000_021","Much obliged! Now, with a little heat and time, these odds n' ends'll make a fine compost, but that's not all they're good for. Spread 'em straight onto the soil and they make for a decent fertilizer in a pinch."
62,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_TAPIPYA_000_022","That's what folks used to do in the olden days, anyhow. But then the Head of Reason and his companions got to puttin' their knowledge o' plants and whatnot to use, sowing the seeds of the compostin' techniques we use today."
63,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_TAPIPYA_000_023","I named this farm Seafoam Fields for good reason─that salty ocean air brings with it plenty o' minerals which help the plants thrive. All it takes beyond that is a bit o' compost to bring out the best in the soil."
64,"TEXT_KINGZA008_05024_TAPIPYA_000_024","With all these scraps, I should be set for a good while. Appreciate the help, traveler. For what it's worth, I hope you learned a thing or two from all my prattlin' on!"
