49,"TEXT_KINGZD006_05095_ELDERLY05095_000_002","Their trainin' is due to start in Xmun Hojaw, to the south. If you're ready and willin' to show off your skills to a few eager hunters, we'll be awaitin' you there."
50,"TEXT_KINGZD006_05095_ELDERLY05095_000_010","Welcome, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! It's good you came─I was beginnin' to worry my vawtsaral br'aax would become bored, and bored prey makes for boring sport."
51,"TEXT_KINGZD006_05095_ELDERLY05095_000_011","Is that surprise I sense? What else did you expect? Some in the Brethren of Br'aax train the beasts of our namesake to fight alongside them─me, for one."
52,"TEXT_KINGZD006_05095_ELDERLY05095_000_012","Now go on, show these kittens what a real fighter is made of! I don't expect any quarter from you!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZD006_05095_ELDERLY05095_000_020","Well, they lasted longer than I expected, at least. Nothin's a better teacher than bitter defeat, eh? I'll mend their hurts later─don't worry, the only lastin' wounds'll be to their ego."
54,"TEXT_KINGZD006_05095_ELDERLY05095_000_022","Now, you probably have better things to do than humor an old man and his pets. Let's get back to Iq Br'aax and we'll see about gettin' you paid for your efforts."

56,"TEXT_KINGZD006_05095_ELDERLY05095_000_031","The techniques we use to tame the forest's beasts have been passed down through generations among the Xbr'aal. You can imagine they were of great use to us durin' our war with the Mamool Ja."
57,"TEXT_KINGZD006_05095_ELDERLY05095_000_032","Even during these peaceful times, having a few animals at our beck and call makes our daily huntin' all the easier. Of course, we don't need as many as before, so many of our companions were released back into the wilds."
58,"TEXT_KINGZD006_05095_ELDERLY05095_000_033","Even so, I can't let the knowledge of my forebears die with me. In quiet times as well, I must sharpen their fangs."
