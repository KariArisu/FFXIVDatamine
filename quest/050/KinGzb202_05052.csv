Nopli is eager to put a stop to the pernicious peddler's malevolent schemes."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_SEQ_01","To prevent anyone else from falling victim to the peddler's deception, Nopli asks that you search for them at Icuvlo's Inn, the man in question described as a Lalafell by the name of Gigimolu.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_SEQ_02","You find Gigimolu, but are alarmed to discover that he is in fact the selfsame Dunesfolk merchant you spoke with on your voyage to Tural. You barely exchange a few words before he rushes off to Panaqpelu Retreat. Keeping your assigned task well in mind, you decide to follow him."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_SEQ_03","Once more you speak with Gigimolu, who you find bathing in the hot springs of the retreat. Unfortunately, it is not long before he grows suspicious of your sudden interest. Lest he see through the ruse, you decide to speak with his hired help, Cavli, instead."
4,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_SEQ_04","Cavli is shocked to learn of Gigimolu's duplicitous actions, which call to mind the treatment of his fellow Pelupelu. He promises to keep a watchful eye on the Lalafellin merchant, and asks that you return to Nopli."
5,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_SEQ_05","While he was unable to discover any other victims of Gigimolu's schemes in Wachunpelo, Nopli is certain the merchant is planning to strike again soon. Before that happens, Nopli hopes to enact a plan of his own, and he needs your help to see it through."

49,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_NOPLI_000_001","I'll ask around in Wachunpelo if anyone else has had similar run-ins with disreputable merchants."
50,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_NOPLI_000_002","In the meantime, I'd like you to find the scoundrel, and keep him in your sights by whatever means necessary. We can't have him leaving before we've had the chance to settle this matter, after all."
51,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_NOPLI_000_003","I expect he's still in Urqopacha, visiting the markets to use his ill-gotten pel to stock up for his return to Eorzea."
52,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_NOPLI_000_004","Like as not, he's inspecting the stalls at Icuvlo's Inn. Ask after a Lalafell by the name of Gigimolu, but be discreet! Once you've found him, try to keep him occupied for as long as you can."
53,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_GIGIMOLU_000_010","Ah, well this is a pleasant surprise. To think we would meet again here of all places. You do recognize me, don't you? The merchant you spoke with on the ship to Tuliyollal?"
54,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_GIGIMOLU_000_011","I neglected to impart my name to you at the time, but I shall happily rectify that now. Gigimolu, at your service. Since my arrival on the continent, I must say business has been booming."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_GIGIMOLU_000_012","I'll spare you the details of my most recent transaction, but suffice it to say, I earned quite a handsome sum from a most generous young merchant. Heh, truly makes the lengthy voyage here feel well worth the trouble."
56,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_GIGIMOLU_000_013","All that remains before I return to Eorzea is to purchase some commodities. Alas, ever since I've felt the soothing waters of Panaqpelu Retreat on my skin, I can think of little else."
57,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_GIGIMOLU_000_014","The mere mention of it has stirred my yearning to avail myself of those hot springs once more... Ahem. It was a pleasure to meet you again my friend, but I must be going. Farewell!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_020","He never tires of this place..."
59,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_GIGIMOLU_000_025","Oh, it's you again... Did you follow me here? <hic> Or perhaps you too have succumbed to the allure of these hot springs?"
60,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_GIGIMOLU_000_026","<hic> The water is the perfect temperature, and the view, <Emphasis>ravishing</Emphasis>. All my worries seem to just melt away... Though I suppose I've also Cavli to thank for that. He's been the perfect attendant, taking care of my every need."

62,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_SYSTEM_000_028","Gigimolu is growing suspicious of you. Perhaps it would be best to speak with Cavli instead."

64,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_031","Gigimolu truly did such an awful thing!? I had no idea..."
65,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_032","He only recently began to visit these springs, and hired me to take care of odds and ends for him during his sojourns. I took him to be quite the affluent individual, the way he carries himself."
66,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_033","My heart goes out to poor Nopli, but as a Pelupelu, I am quite intrigued by Gigimolu's trading practices."
67,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_034","Allow me to explain. Many years ago, we Pelupelu were looked down upon by the other peoples of Tural─both figuratively and literally─due to our diminutive stature."
68,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_035","Chagrined, it is said that our ancestors decided to start wearing masks made in the image of the most powerful tural vidraal, Valigarmanda, in order to strike fear into the hearts of all who looked upon them."
69,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_036","Today, however, the meaning of the masks has changed. After becoming peddlers at the Dawnservant's suggestion, the masks have come to symbolize fair transactions─indeed, they are now proof of our reputability."
70,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_037","Instead of focusing solely on our own profit, we endeavor to make every trade mutually satisfactory. Countless years of doing so has earned us the respect of those around us, and we now very rarely experience any belittlement."
71,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_038","Yet it seems Gigimolu wishes only to fill his own coffers, even at the expense of those with whom he does business."
72,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_039","It's a shame. After what he's done, no Turali will wish to barter with him again─no matter what quality of import he has at hand."
73,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_040","I will keep a close watch on him from now on. I don't want to see anyone else swindled out of their hard-earned pel. "
74,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_041","...Though given his present euphoria, I doubt he'll be doing anything of the sort any time soon."
75,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_042","That said, I'm sure Nopli must be anxious to hear from you. I have matters here well in hand─why don't you return to him?"
76,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_GIGIMOLU_000_045","<hic> Here I am, enjoying myself, while everyone else is working so hard... How <Emphasis>selfish</Emphasis> of me. Heh heh heh..."
77,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_CAVLI_000_046","Don't worry, I won't let him out of my sight."
78,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_NOPLI_000_050","<Emphasis>What</Emphasis>!? You met Gigimolu during your voyage to Tural!? What a small world..."
79,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_NOPLI_000_051","In any case, thank you for lending your assistance once again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It's reassuring to know Cavli will be keeping careful watch of him."
80,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_NOPLI_000_052","As for my investigation here, it seems I'm presently Gigimolu's only victim."
81,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_NOPLI_000_053","But I fear I won't be the last. There's no telling what underhanded tricks he'll use to procure those wares you spoke of, and I refuse to let him besmirch all that it means to be a merchant."
82,"TEXT_KINGZB202_05052_NOPLI_000_054","I have a plan, but I'm going to need your help."
