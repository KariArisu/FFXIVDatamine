49,"TEXT_KINGZC010_05069_LONUHALI_000_001","Although I want nothing more than to eat until my belly bursts, I've saved a batch for those who are planning the reconstruction of the great stairs. I'm much too full to make such a journey, however─might you deliver them in my stead?"

55,"TEXT_KINGZC010_05069_GANUHALI_000_007","When the reeds sprouted big and tall, we had cause to celebrate often, and it was a common scent in Ok'hanu. To have these delivered by one who helped those days to return is a great honor indeed!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZC010_05069_ZONUHANU_000_008","This project will cause my feathers to fall out one by one, mark my words... Where do we even begin?"

62,"TEXT_KINGZC010_05069_GANUHALI_000_014","It's been too long since there were enough extra reeds to make dumplings. Thank you for reminding me that better times are upon us!"

64,"TEXT_KINGZC010_05069_TONUHANU_000_016","While this area can be reached by water routes, the stairs are a much less strenuous journey for all involved. With hunger no longer a distraction, I hope I can finally solve the problem of their reconstruction."
