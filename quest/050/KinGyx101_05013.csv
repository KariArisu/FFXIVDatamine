1,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_SEQ_01","It seems that Zeycihan, a professor of archaeology at the Studium, has recently discovered ancient ruins in Shaaloani. Unfortunately for him and his hired team of mercenaries, however, the fiends en route proved too great an obstacle to overcome, and thus the desperate scholar has come to plead─or rather, demand─your help in exploring the ruins instead. Being the charitable soul that you are, you agree to aid his cause, and make ready to meet him in the Pyariyoanaan Plain."
2,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_SEQ_02","What Zeycihan neglected to mention is that in order to reach the ruins, one must first brave a valley teeming with prickly sabotenders. He goes on to explain that, while he believes the ruins to be Yok Huy in origin, he discovered archaeological motifs unrecognizable even to him. All of which is to say, you must be prepared to face anything─including a thousand thousand needles pointed in your direction.

※Tender Valley can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
3,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_SEQ_03","The ruins lying in the valley's deepest depths have been explored, and the once dormant serpentine creature within has been defeated. Zeycihan will wish to hear of your findings."
4,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_SEQ_04","Zeycihan listens intently as you relay to him your discoveries within the ancient ruins, and is most excited to hear that you found architecture belonging to a different civilization than the Yok Huy within. He is inspired to impart to you his theory regarding the similarities between civilizations of the Source and the reflections, and as one who has traversed across the rift between worlds, he wishes to borrow your expertise for one last inquiry in Worlar's Echo, where he intends to speak with a chronicler of the Yok Huy."
5,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_SEQ_05","As the champion who brought Valigarmanda low, the temple chronicler is happy to share with you a story of the great serpent. Thus does he invite you to view the murals in the Indelible Path."
6,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_SEQ_06","Both you and Zeycihan listen carefully as the temple chronicler weaves for you a tale regarding the ancient Yok Huy who once forged north to Xak Tural, where they discovered the ancient ruins and the great serpent dormant within. Alas, they were struck by a great plague which spread like wildfire among their people, and despite their supplications to the slumbering serpent, the vast majority were ultimately forced to withdraw from the area to survive. Believed by the Yok Huy to govern the boundary between worlds, Zeycihan theorizes that it is no coincidence the great serpent awoke when you, an individual capable of crossing the rift, arrived. For now, the archaeologist intends to use the day's discoveries to further establish his life's work, <Emphasis>A Theory: The Eerie Resemblance of the Reflections' Civilizations</Emphasis>. As for whether you were truly blessed by the great serpent which dwelled within the ruins─only time will tell..."

49,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_002","Ah, but introductions are in order. I am Zeycihan, professor of archaeology at the Studium. At the behest of the former Head of Reason, I was invited to oversee various archaeological expeditions throughout Tural."
50,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_003","I heard from a little bird in Vollok Shoonsa that you, a most renowned adventurer, had made your way to the continent, and could think of no better individual to aid me in uncovering its history."
51,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_004","As a matter of fact, I have already made a most fascinating discovery in the wilds of Xak Tural!"
52,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_005","I chartered a balloon to examine a point of interest in Shaaloani, you see, and soon discovered ruins which have been unseen for nigh a millennium! “Surely, Lady Luck is on my side,” I thought. But alas, things soon took a turn for the worse..."
53,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_006","In the spirit of inquiry, I hired a group of mercenaries for protection and made my first foray into the area, but we were no more than halfway through before a host of fierce fiends barred our approach. Truth be told, 'tis a miracle we even made it out alive."
54,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_007","Yet for a seasoned explorer like you, I daresay delving into the deepest recesses of such ruins unharmed would be child's play. What do you say? Would you aid my investigation, and embark on this new adventure?"
55,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_008","I knew you wouldn't disappoint! The ruins lie beyond the river north of Lake Toari in Shaaloani. Let us continue our conversation there!"

58,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_012","Doubtless the ruins have remained untouched for all these years due to its barbed environs. After all, none would wish to become the victim of their thousand thousand needles!"
59,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_013","Though I believed the ruins nested deep within the valley to be Yok Huy in origin, a closer inspection revealed motifs even I could not recognize. There's a new discovery waiting to be found within, I'm sure of it!"
60,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_014","Alas, the defense mechanisms protecting it were far too much for the mercenaries I hired. You would be wise not to underestimate them yourself."

67,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_033","This is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, a significant discovery regarding Xak Tural's history. Tell me, what thoughts have you concerning the valley's depths?"

73,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_035","Yes, just as I predicted! Compared to other Yok Huy ruins, the magicked mechanisms you mention are quite astonishing... I am all but certain they based the technology on that of an earlier civilization."
74,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_036","Bwah!? Truly? Such a claim is invaluable testimony!"
75,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_037","Clearly the sheer grandeur of seeing these ancient ruins has left you in a daze. To put you in such a state bespeaks its occult nature... I'm more and more convinced this is a groundbreaking discovery!"
76,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_038","You know of the legendary inscriptions said to be writ by an illustrious Yok Huy of eld!? I am most impressed. I've yet to fully decipher them, but my, if the creature described in chapter fifty-six, verse three is in fact the great serpent, this is a most intriguing discovery indeed!"
77,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_039","Based on your descriptions, it is likely that the ancient Yok Huy simultaneously feared <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> revered this serpent of unfathomable power, and after encountering it, constructed the temple to conceal it from the world."

80,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_042","Their findings indicate that the sundering diminished mankind's intelligence to that of beasts. The flourishing civilization of the ancients was forgotten, and the peoples of each reflection set out on separate paths, forging disparate civilizations of their own..."
81,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_00_043","Yet can we say that these civilizations worlds apart are truly so different? If we all came from one shared, ancient heritage, would it not be natural that the development of each society and culture bear similarities to one another?"
82,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_044","What I am trying to say, is that it is entirely possible a society which predates the Yok Huy and bears similarities to ancient Ronka once existed in the Source!"
83,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_045","Naturally, it is necessary to conduct further research regarding <Emphasis>how</Emphasis> twin civilizations born in two separate worlds developed under entirely different environments. Nevertheless, your discovery today has provided further proof of the plausibility of my theory!"
84,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_046","On that subject, I would ask you to join me on another adventure─one markedly less fraught with danger. As one who has traversed beyond the rift to the First, your knowledge and insight concerning ancient Ronka are invaluable."
85,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_047","I would journey to Worlar's Echo and speak with a chronicler of the Yok Huy, that I may learn of their legends─who knows, we may just discover some striking parallels to the culture of ancient Ronka!"
86,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_049","Master Zeycihan has told me of his request. I hope that I am able to be of some help."

88,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_051","Ahem. A subject for another time, perhaps. The personage before us is the selfsame individual who informed me that Yok Huy ruins may exist in Shaaloani."

90,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_052","Tell me, my friend. Based on what I've shared with you, were you able to find any commonalities between the legends of your people and the ruins we discovered in Xak Tural?"
91,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_053","Excluding those concerning disease, precious few stories of our ancestors who traversed north have been passed down."
92,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_054","But, for the valiant warrior who brought the Skyruin low, I would share with you a story regarding the great serpent─one we normally would not disclose to outsiders. Please, follow me to the Indelible Passage. The murals shall explain all."
93,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_060","So these are the murals which depict the legends of the Yok Huy! When I was previously here for research, I was not allowed in this far!"
94,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_100_061","A legend concerning the great serpent is hidden within this mural. Pray gaze upon it carefully, as I weave for you an ancient tale..."
95,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_061","Long, long ago, a sect of our ancestors forged north. There, deep within a valley, they discovered the remains of an ancient temple."
96,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_062","Its inhabitants had long perished, and the purpose for which the structure existed was itself an enigma. Yet when our forebears finally delved into its furthest recesses, they discovered a great serpent deep in slumber."
97,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_063","It should be noted, our people revere serpents as divine creatures who govern the boundary between worlds. To behold one of such immense power, dormant there within the ruins, they believed it best to build a temple around its chambers, and offer prayers for its divine protection."
98,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_064","Yet in the ensuing years, our people were plagued by disease. Time and again our ancestors offered supplications for divine assistance, but no matter how fervent their prayers, the great serpent never deigned to answer them."
99,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_065","In the end, a great many of our forebears withdrew from the northern lands. Only the most devout worshipers of the great serpent remained, but they too would eventually withdraw in a somber procession, having buried too many brothers and sisters."
100,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_066","The sect who remained prayed for the great serpent's awakening─they prayed for a salvation that would never come..."
101,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_067","Yet why should it awaken now? And what incited its aggression? Was it simply by chance that it roused in so foul a mood, or is there perhaps some underlying reason we've yet to uncover?"
102,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_068","The devout who held vigil of the temple held this belief: “When the great serpent doth awaken, its coil shall envelop the world.” In other words, the creature's discovery was itself a pretext to legitimize their territorial expansion north."
103,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_069","Yet their prayers fell on deaf ears. Only now, before our benefactor, has the great serpent finally awoken. A peculiar, but altogether fascinating turn of events."
104,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_TELLER05013_000_080","If the being you encountered truly was divine, mayhap it is you who shall receive its blessings."
105,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_070","If we consider that our friend here, a traveler capable of crossing the rift 'twixt worlds, was blessed by a being who governs that boundary, would that not fit the interpretation held by the sect who remained?"
106,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_071","At any rate, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s testimony and the legends of the Yok Huy shall go a long way in verifying my theory."

108,"TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_ZEYCIHAN_000_074","Does the inception of civilization and its infancy bear similarities in each reflection? Was there some localized connection between them, such as a planar fissure? Or perhaps there was some all-powerful “Keeper of Whispers” peering through the veil."
