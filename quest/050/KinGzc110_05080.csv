48,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_000","Ah! You there, adventurer. I have a proposition─one that will likely prove profitable for the both of us."
49,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_001","You remember the recent storm? I was nearly at Many Fires when it struck, so I urged my alpaca onwards through the whipping winds rather than seeking immediate shelter. Alas, when the storm settled, I discovered that those same winds had carried off half my stock."
50,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_002","I should very much like to recover it, but I hear it told that the roads are plagued by brigands of late─another reason why I was keen to press on to the safety of Many Fires. And so I find myself torn over the wisest course of action: to write off my loss, or to speculate to re-accumulate?"
51,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_003","But now a third option presents itself: to invest in one to whom the risk of a return journey would be much reduced, on account of <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> utter derision of danger. The items I lost are likely lying along the riverbank between here and Earthenshire─if you would take up the offer?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_004","The route I took followed the river from Earthenshire, and so my missing belongings are likely lying along its banks even now...if they haven't already been washed downstream or pilfered by ne'er-do-wells."
53,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_005","Ah, you're back─and still in one piece, I see. That's good news, at least. Do you...have any more for me?"
54,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_006","Oh, thank you, thank you! The containers may be a little waterlogged, but the merchandise inside seems none the worse for wear."
55,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_007","Crafting tools, if you're interested. My stock in trade. I was especially loath to leave them behind after learning of the collapse of the great ascent. Demand will be through the roof! "
56,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_008","Thank the gods you appeared when you did. Nature may have blessed us Pelupelu with an enterprising spirit and an unquenchable wanderlust, but She also made us slight of stature and meager of thew.

If I had been the one to go back in search of them, I'd likely have lost my head to a bandit's axe or else washed over the falls to my doom!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_009","It's the reason my people often employ sellswords to guard our caravans...but their rates will have surely doubled or more since the storm wreaked so much chaos on the roads... Never fear, though─for you have taught me that when in want of a sellsword, an adventurer will suffice!"
