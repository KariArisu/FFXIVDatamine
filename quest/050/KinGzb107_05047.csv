49,"TEXT_KINGZB107_05047_GARHORLUR_000_001","You see, the illuminations here in Worlar's Echo make use of glowstones, a rare and precious mineral found only through mining. On occasion, we offer up prayers in the hopes that their light remains strong and bright."
50,"TEXT_KINGZB107_05047_GARHORLUR_000_002","First, I would ask you raise a hand to the saltwater jar and pray for light everlasting."
51,"TEXT_KINGZB107_05047_GARHORLUR_000_003","Strange though it may seem, I assure you it is a necessary step in our ritual. Now, great warrior, slayer of Valigarmanda, open your heart and focus!"

54,"TEXT_KINGZB107_05047_GARHORLUR_000_013","Now that the saltwater has received of your prayers, you need merely sprinkle it upon the glowstones scattered around the village and the ritual will be complete."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB107_05047_GARHORLUR_000_015","Take the saltwater imbued with your energies and sprinkle it upon the glowstones scattered around the village. With that, the ritual will be complete."
56,"TEXT_KINGZB107_05047_GARHORLUR_000_020","I see you have successfully completed the ritual, and for that, you have my thanks. Likewise, my fellow Yok Huy will be glad to know that an outsider has shared in our culture."
57,"TEXT_KINGZB107_05047_GARHORLUR_000_022","When mining the peak for glowstones, we occasionally discover shellfish fossils. Some have wondered if perhaps this tall mountain was once submerged beneath the waves many long lifetimes ago."
58,"TEXT_KINGZB107_05047_GARHORLUR_000_023","The stones' radiance is a reflection of their joy, shining all the brighter when offered water that smells of the sea...or so the story goes. Thus was our little tradition born."
59,"TEXT_KINGZB107_05047_GARHORLUR_000_024","Knowing that it is the will of a great warrior that now illuminates our humble village, our spirits are sure to lighten as well."
