Lanuhanu is ready to start cleaning feathers."
1,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_SEQ_01","While you know not how many steps are required to process feathers before their delivery, your first task is to collect dyes and oils from Ok'bek'be. These two items are essential for making feathers worthy of such a long held tradition.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_SEQ_02","As instructed, the dyes and oils are in a crate at the Ok'bek'be storeroom. The foreman stresses that they must not be dropped before he leaves you to your task."
3,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_SEQ_03","You have picked up the crates of dyes and oils. Deliver it to Lanuhanu within the allotted time limit."
4,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_SEQ_04","You complete your somewhat stressful journey to Ok'hanu, and see that Nahanshe has arrived before you, although the ordeal seems to have taken everything out of him. Put down your burden and speak with the enthusiastic Lanuhanu."
5,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_SEQ_05","With all the supplies at hand, Lanuhanu is ready to begin dyeing and oiling the feathers─one by one. Nahanshe balks at the enormity of this task, but Lanuhanu stresses that everything must be done with the proper care and caution. Finally realizing how much thought goes into the equipment he wears, Nahanshe apologizes for his previous attitude and dives into the work with a newfound vigor. The task goes by surprisingly quickly, and Nahanshe appears eager to bring the finished product back to his superiors."
6,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_SEQ_06","It appears that your work is not done yet, as Lanuhanu informs you proper rituals must be observed before Nahanshe can complete his delivery. You know not what is to come, but it is clear Kixaihih is involved somehow."

50,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_001","The first items we require are dyes and oils. The former is used to match the feathers with various uniforms worn by the troops. The latter serves a different purpose..."
51,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_002","As you can see by observing yours truly, Hanuhanu boast feathers full and colorful. This is thanks to the oils our body secretes, which keep our coat from becoming drab and brittle."
52,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_003","But the feathers we gift to the Landsguard were molted long ago, and have since lost their natural luster. So, we must apply oil to make them as vibrant as those of a Hanu in their prime!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_004","The task of gathering said oils and dyes falls to <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Go to Ok'bek'be, where a crate has already been prepared. In the meantime, Nahanshe here will get the feathers!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_010","Interesting. Of course, we maintain our equipment regularly, and oiling the feathers is part of that. But I never considered how the Hanuhanu might keep theirs pristine..."
55,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_015","We trade for the oils and dyes with Pelupelu merchants who pass through Ok'bek'be, so they're generally stored there for the sake of convenience."
56,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_HANUHANUFOREMAN05082_000_030","You're here about the supplies? Good, good─everything's in that crate over there. It's heavy, so be careful not to drop it on those dainty toes of yours."
57,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_HANUHANUFOREMAN05082_000_031","Worse still, you might break a bottle of dye. The Landsguard artisan who designed their uniforms was very particular about their coloring, so not a single one can go to waste."
58,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_HANUHANUFOREMAN05082_000_032","There's nothing a soldier loves more than their equipment, so every detail has to be just right. Tread as carefully as you can back to Lanuhanu."

65,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_065","Welcome back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! You arrived just in time─Nahanshe has brought the feathers, as you can see."
66,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_080","You both did excellent work today. Nahanshe, it appears you might need some rest after your ordeal, hmm?"
67,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_081","Ungh... How many feathers did you pack into that crate? Are you sure you didn't send <Emphasis>me</Emphasis> to get the dyes and oils?"
68,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_082","Be glad I didn't, Nahanshe, for <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s crate is much heavier! <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> also carried it from a much greater distance."

70,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_084","...But that won't happen again. I've had enough rest, so let's get on with it!"
71,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_085","If you insist, Nahanshe! Let us proceed to the heart of the matter. First, we must dye each feather one by one─but be careful, for each color is needed in differing quantities."
72,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_086","Equipment used to attack is adorned with black feathers, while equipment used for defense is adorned with feathers in their original green. For those, we must carefully─"
73,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_087","Hold on just a damned moment! We're dyeing <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> of these? One by one!? I'll be an old man by then!"
74,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_088","There has to be a better way. Say...throw a few dozen of them in a big bowl of dye."
75,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_089","Ah, but that will make the coloring uneven, Nahanshe. As I was saying, we must carefully apply oil to the feathers to bring out their original color, or they'll quickly become brittle."
76,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_090","I...I see."
77,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_091","This will be a test of patience, but with the three of us, it shall be over before the moon turns─probably. Worry not, for I'm here to teach you how best to see the job done."
78,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_092","...I suppose I'm thankful for that. Truth be told, I never knew so much hard work went into our uniforms."
79,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_093","For our brothers and sisters in the Landsguard, no effort is too great! The Hanuhanu are honored that you wear our feathers."
80,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_094","You are surprised? As the Wind's Chosen, seeing my feathers become a symbol of the great Kixaihih fills me with a joy unequaled in this world!"
81,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_095","And to have them adorn the Landsguard's armor makes my joy all the sweeter. Few in Tural can claim such an honor, so there can be no mistakes!"

83,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_097","I, eh...would like to apologize for how I've been acting. I see now that things are done a certain way for a reason."
84,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_098","So, while I may grow old and grey in the doing, I'll see that every feather is dyed or oiled properly. At least we're in this together, eh, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
85,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_110","Your work was swift and capable, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! The hardest part is behind us now..."
86,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_NAHANSHE_000_130","I reckon I'll be cleaning dye from under my nails for some days yet, but I won't complain about honest work. Now I have to think about how to get these back to Tuliyollal."
87,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_132","Don't get ahead of yourself, young Nahanshe! Yes, the hard part is behind us, but there is more I would ask of you."
88,"TEXT_KINGZC202_05082_LANUHANU_000_133","As I've said before, Kixaihih is revered by the Hanuhanu, and we must pay due respect for use of its likeness. As such, there are time-honored rituals that must be followed before we give this offering to the Landsguard."
