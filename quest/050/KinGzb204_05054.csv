Nopli is of a mind to swindle a swindler."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_SEQ_01","Suspecting that Gigimolu would not give him the time of day, Nopli asks that you speak with the merchant on his behalf and inform him of a trader that deals in rare goods to draw his interest. With this task in mind, you set off for Panaqpelu Retreat once more.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_SEQ_02","Gigimolu is quite easily hooked by the enticing bait you and Nopli have prepared, and asks that you wait for him on the lower level of the retreat while he makes himself presentable."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_SEQ_03","You do not wait long before Nopli and a clothed Gigimolu arrive. Initially suspicious of Nopli's intent, and doubtful of his eye for quality, Gigimolu's guard is gradually lowered through your periodic interventions during the negotiation, paving the way for Nopli to introduce the uolon bristle hairbrush. Taking a liking to the product, the Ul'dahn merchant eventually agrees to pay one hundred thousand pel per brush Nopli can offer."
4,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_SEQ_04","Nopli is thrilled that his plan went exactly as he hoped. Now it is time to return to Wachunpelo, where the true negotiation will take place. "
5,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_SEQ_05","Gigimolu is forced to face his own naivety when Nopli reveals the true market value of the hairbrushes, and realizes how shortsighted it was of him to dupe others for profit. Nopli's graciousness seems to have rubbed off on the Dunesfolk merchant, who apologizes for his actions, and pledges to make amends for his wrongdoings. Though they may have started off on the wrong foot, the pair appear to be at the beginning of what you hope will be a long, and mutually beneficial relationship."

52,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_012","I expect he's still soaking in the springs, so try searching for him first at Panaqpelu Retreat. I will join you after procuring a suitable store of hairbrushes."

54,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_021","I see... And you wished to introduce me to this merchant of exotic wares? How thoughtful of you. I'm honestly surprised you remembered that I've yet to find suitable goods to take back to Eorzea."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_022","Very well. I shall meet this merchant, but I can hardly sit at the negotiating table in little more than a bathing towel. Pray wait for me below while I make myself presentable."
56,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_023","It would not do for me to show any openings before the other party, if you take my meaning. Pray wait for me below, in the rest area."

62,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_031","N-Nopli!? I see... So you two were in cahoots. If you've come to return the corrupted crystals, I'm afraid I do not accept refunds."
63,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_032","Didn't <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> tell you? I'm here to make you an offer."

69,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_035","This is not only for your benefit, but that of new customers you're certain to meet in future commercial endeavors. Upon my mask, I swear it!"
70,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_036","I did no such thing. I told him the crystals are rare in Tural─which they are. As a fellow merchant, he bears full responsibility for making an uninformed purchase."
71,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_037","You can swear upon whatever you like─I still won't believe you. The only thing I trust less than your word is your meager eye for quality. Any product selected by your hand is one unworthy of my stalls."

75,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_038","No, I will not. The rash fool bought my entire stock of corrupted crystals without a second thought. How could I put any faith in such utter lack of discernment?"
76,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_039","<Emphasis>You</Emphasis> selected it? Well now, that changes things. Considering your wealth of experience in both Eorzea and Tural, yours are eyes I can trust."
77,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_040","I see we have your attention! Then without further ado, allow me to present to you my premium selection of high-quality alpaca hairbrushes! "
78,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_041","The bristles are firm yet supple, gentle on the skin, and exceedingly pleasant to the touch! Even the most sensitive alpacas can't get enough of it! Indeed, I daresay these brushes are of unparalleled quality."
79,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_042","We already have brushes for livestock in Eorzea. Furthermore, the market for such a commodity would be limited to farmers, all but squandering any chance to profit. I will not purchase a product merely because it is of good quality."
80,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_Q4_000_000","What will you say?"

83,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_043","<sigh> Let us say, hypothetically, that some day alpaca farming were to become widespread throughout Eorzea. Am I to keep a stockpile of these brushes in storage until that day arrives? Gods, I grow weary of this inane discussion."
84,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_044","I must admit, as a merchant, it is important to always make oneself as personable as possible. Yet I am confused as to why you would ask..."
85,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_045","Ah! So people can use the brush as well. Then may I try it for myself? If it is a quality product for men and women of good taste, then the potential market would expand considerably!"
86,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_046","Oh my... This is quite lovely! The way the bristles gently caress my scalp, each stroke gliding through my hair like a gentle breeze, and somehow every strand falls perfectly into place. My hair has never felt so soft and smooth!"
87,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_047","Yes, consider me interested. I daresay the brushes will sell themselves to those with a like-minded taste for elegance."
88,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_048","Now, let us discuss payment. By my estimation, a single brush would be worth roughly ten thousand pel, give or take."
89,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_049","Ah, speaking of worth, I forgot to mention one terribly important detail. The brushes are made with the hair of a creature indigenous to Tural─the uolon!"
90,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_050","Specimens are painstakingly chosen for each brush by a master craftsman, paying close attention to the beasts' age as well as the texture, thickness, and strength of their hair. I'd say a single brush is worth no less than two pel in the hundred thousands column!"
91,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_051","I beg your pardon? Two <Emphasis>hundred thousand</Emphasis> pel for a brush? You must be out of your mind. I shall take my business elsewhere."
92,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_052","Wait! After purchasing the corrupted crystals from you, I'm in urgent need of funds. If you agree not to disclose this to anyone else, I'm willing to sell the brushes to you for half that price!"
93,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_053","Hmm... You'd go so far as to offer them at half their market price. And it certainly comes as no surprise that you lack capital. I may not find a more opportune bargain..."
94,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_054","Very well, you have yourself a deal. I shall use all the pel I have on hand to purchase as many brushes as you can offer!"
95,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_060","To think the man I swindled would offer me such a bargain. The Pelupelu may make for better customers than they do merchants."
96,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_CAVLI_000_061","Nopli did well to convince Gigimolu the brushes have such value. Though he could not have done so without you."
97,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_062","Now then, let us return to my storehouse in Wachunpelo to finalize our transaction. I trust that is fine with you, Gigimolu? "
98,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_063","Indeed. I shall make a short detour to Icuvlo's Inn to gather my things before joining you. Pray excuse me."
99,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_064","Whew, the negotiations went rather well, if I do say so myself! I cannot thank you enough for your assistance!"
100,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_065","But now the negotiations can truly begin. We should hurry back to Wachunpelo as well."
101,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_066","All that remains is the final exchange. Dear Nopli truly is a generous soul..."
102,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_070","There you are, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Now that we're all assembled, let's continue our discussion."
103,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_071","What is there to discuss? The deal is already agreed upon. All that remains is the exchange of goods."
104,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_072","Are you sure? Even if I told you that the actual value of a brush is a single pel in the ten thousands column?"
105,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_073","Wh-What!? You deceived me!?"
106,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_074","Oh, no, nothing of the sort. I merely followed your example. "
107,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_075","I do personally believe that a single brush is worth two pel in the hundred thousands column. I also urgently need funds after purchasing those crystals. But more importantly, the brushes <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> of unparalleled quality."
108,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_076","To think I would be outfoxed by the man I took for a fool... Yet why tell me its true value now? Had you remained silent, you could have made back all the money you lost."
109,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_077","I find that a strange question. Are we not both merchants? Rather than prey on one another, hoping to make our fortunes in a single exchange, would it not be mutually beneficial for us in the long term to become trade partners?"
110,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_078","As far as I'm concerned, this is a chance I can't afford to let slip away. Foreign merchants willing to sail all the way to Tural are few and far between─and I certainly won't have the wherewithal to travel to Eorzea myself any time soon."
111,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_079","After all I've done, you would ask to be my trade partner?"
112,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_080","I ply my trade in a city called Ul'dah, where the unspoken rule of business is to deceive or be deceived. To seize what opportunities you can and quickly move on. Long-term profits have ever been the furthest thing from my mind."
113,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_081","When I first saw you, Nopli, I could sense your naivety. Thus did I approach you with a mind to exploit it, and pawned my worthless corrupted crystals into your eager hands. At the time, I thought it simply business as usual."
114,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_082","And yet I am wholly embarrassed by the thought of it now. That you would use the same ploy against me, and for even greater profit, makes it all the more shameful."
115,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_083","Nopli. I am truly sorry for deceiving you. I shall return all the money I took from you, and make what amends I can for the trouble I've caused. I do not deserve your forgiveness, let alone your partnership, but if you're certain that is the best course..."
116,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_084","I am! But forget about the money. I'd like you to bring back more of those corrupted crystals!"
117,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_085","If I can find some use for them, we'll have a product that can be easily sold for a premium, and we can corner the market here in Tural!"
118,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_GIGIMOLU_000_086","I am happy to oblige, but until such time that the crystals become profitable here, I could not proceed in good conscience without a product we can both benefit from. If it please you, I'd like to explore our options."
119,"TEXT_KINGZB204_05054_NOPLI_000_087","I couldn't have convinced Gigimolu without your help, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Together, I believe he and I can bring others happiness through trade in not only Tural, but Eorzea and beyond!"
