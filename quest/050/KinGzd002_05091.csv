49,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_001","What you see before you is a tsoly─or cenote, as they're more commonly known─and it's far more vast than it appears from the surface. I've even heard that some are connected by underwater tunnels."
50,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_002","This one is called Xd'aa Talat Tsoly, and stories say that long ago, a swimmer with lungs like a fish made it all the way to a cenote to the northwest. But no one since has been able to swim that far..."
51,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_003","Apparently he left a sack of coins at the bottom of the cenote to mark his arrival. If you think you're his equal, maybe you could retrieve it? I've been dying to know if the legend is true."
52,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_005","No one's ever been able to make that legendary swim except the legend himself. Bring those coins back here and we'll know if his reputation is deserved."
53,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_010","You're back! I tried to hold my breath until you returned, but that didn't last long... Anyways, did you find the coins?"
54,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_011","They were really there!? So the two cenotes were actually connected?"
55,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_A1_000_001","Looks like it."
57,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_A1_000_002","I didn't actually go up to the surface."
58,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_012","So it's true! I tried swimming the tunnels myself once, but I had to turn back once I felt the water fill my lungs. Seeing you in action was truly inspiring!"
59,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_013","You didn't? Well, if those coins were there...then the legend must be true, right?"
60,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_014","You know, I've even heard tell that some cenotes connect to the salt. I didn't believe it at first, but now it's not hard to imagine such a thing."
61,"TEXT_KINGZD002_05091_SWIMXBRAAL05091_000_015","...All right, my mind's made up. I'll be one of the first to reach the salt through a cenote! Who's going to be brave enough to find the coins <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> leave behind, eh?"
