50,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_BOLOGAW_000_003","Like you and me─and like Napikwe. Viper by trade. Always helping out with the Hunt. She took a bill from the board a few days back. Thing is, it was for a mark up in Yyasulani...and no one's seen her since."
51,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_BOLOGAW_000_004","Might be that she's still on its trail, but hearing about everything that's happening up there─all this about the dome─I can't help but worry.

Braved the bolts to drive back the beasts that were tearing up our farmsteads."
58,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_ZOMENIKE_000_013","Where is she now, I wonder? Last I heard, she'd registered with the hunters, but that was years back. She'd probably be retired now, or..."

63,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_FILOMENA_000_021","...You're a friend of Napikwe's? One of many, I'm sure. Such an amiable soul─and such a shame about that injury forcing her from the field."
64,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_FILOMENA_000_022","But what a career! I should think the better part of our data on the local fauna was collected by her and her followers─followers who adore her to this day.

65,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_FILOMENA_000_023","Sharing citizens' personal information is strictly forbidden, as a rule. However, Napikwe left specific instructions that if any fellow Turali should come calling, we should send them directly to her."

68,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_NAPIKWE_000_030","You're a hunter, aren't you? Heh. You've got the gait. The eye. Could see it a malm off."

70,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_NAPIKWE_000_032","Sure, it was a shock when the barrier fell, but what kind of viper would I be if I didn't try to make the best of a bad situation? I joined the hunters. Put my talents to use keeping this place safe. Till ten years ago, that is, when my good hand finally gave out on me."
71,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_NAPIKWE_000_033","Had to leave the front lines. Thought I was done for good, to be honest. But then Her Majesty came to me. Gave me a new mission, cataloging the beasts I no longer had the strength to kill. Gave me a new lease on life."

77,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_BOLOGAW_000_039","She still lives, then─and it seems all this insanity with the dome hasn't dulled her passion for the hunt any. The notebook makes proof of that."

79,"TEXT_KINGYR203_05011_BOLOGAW_000_041","Still, I'm grateful she does. And if she needs my help hunting down some of these beasts, that's exactly what I'll give her."
