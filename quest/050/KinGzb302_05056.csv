Murfurlur is interested to learn more about the adventurer's trade."
1,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_SEQ_01","Murfurlur remains curious about life as an adventurer and wonders if it may suit his skills as a former temple guardian. Upon hearing your description of an adventurer's duties, the Yok Huy recalls a craftsman who might be in need of such services. Yet rather than attempt to approach him on his own, Murfurlur asks that you once again show him how a professional would go about securing a new commission.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_SEQ_02","Luckily for you, the craftsman is very much interested in hiring an adventurer or two to procure Naryor obsidian. The material can be found in Naryor Gorna, but the wildlife there make it a dangerous proposition for those lacking in martial skill. Declaring that this is his trial, Murfurlur asks that you gather three chunks as a demonstration, after which he will see to the remainder."
3,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_SEQ_03","With some effort, you find three pieces of obsidian of sufficient quality. Once you show them to Murfurlur, he should have a clear idea of what to look for."
4,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_SEQ_04","After examining your chunks of Naryor obsidian, Murfurlur is confident he can gather the rest. You need only return to Worlar's Echo and await his return along with the candid craftsman."
5,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_SEQ_05","When the Yok Huy still held ambitions of conquest, obsidian weapons helped them to conquer Tural. These days, however, the material has been largely relegated to decorative trinkets, as the giants eventually recognized the metalworking of other races to be superior. After you receive this history lesson from the craftsman, Murfurlur appears with a bounty of obsidian and is duly compensated. Now that his first commission as an adventurer is complete, he bids you follow him that you might receive your share of the payment."
6,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_SEQ_06","While Murfurlur has found this recent experience fulfilling and yearns to help others in a similar fashion, he worries that such opportunities may be lacking in Worlar's Echo. Indeed, his enthusiasm led him to supply the craftsman with so much obsidian that he will likely not require his services for the foreseeable future, and it is unclear who else in the village might be in need of a stout former temple guardian. For now, however, he will consider his next steps, and perhaps seek your wisdom again should you be willing to provide it."

54,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_MURFURLUR_000_002","I know of someone that might benefit from such assistance. A craftsman in urgent need of a particular material."
55,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_MURFURLUR_000_003","The sites replete with this resource are overrun with fiery fiends, and those ill-equipped to defend themselves dare not brave them. Surely even I could be of some use in that regard."

57,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_MURFURLUR_000_005","I am much obliged to you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. The craftsman of whom I speak plies his trade in the southeast of our village. Let us pray he will be amenable to an arrangement."

70,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_YOKHUYCRAFTER05056_000_030","Welcome back. Judging from Murfurlur's conspicuous absence, I presume he no longer needs your direct supervision?"
71,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_YOKHUYCRAFTER05056_000_031","You may not know this, but Naryor obsidian is of historical importance to the Yok Huy."
72,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_YOKHUYCRAFTER05056_000_032","When our people still ruled the continent, it was valued for the ease with which it could be knapped into razor-sharp weaponry. Arrows, daggers, and the like."
73,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_YOKHUYCRAFTER05056_000_033","While it was our size and strength that enabled us to dominate the other peoples of Tural, tools like these were indispensable as well."

85,"TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_MURFURLUR_000_051","After today, I can say that aiding others has given me a newfound sense of fulfillment. Alas, opportunities to do so may be lacking here in Worlar's Echo."
