1,"TEXT_AKTKCT201_04767_SEQ_01","With what can only be described as a “shite-eating grin,” Grenoldt informs you of the great strides he and Chora-Zoi have made with the splendorous tools in your absence. Summoned to Eulmore to discuss the Boutique's next steps, you are greeted by crowds of skilled artisans...as well as a rogue ironfrog mover belonging to Qeshi-Trao, a trusted associate of Mowen's. During your dealings, Mowen gleefully approves another round of enhancements, and nominates Chora-Zoi as the tools' new namesake. Mowen is well aware of the young smith's apprehension, however, and requests a word with you before the next phase of the project begins in earnest."
2,"TEXT_AKTKCT201_04767_SEQ_02","You approach Mowen, who remains starstruck from Grenoldt's encounter with Qeshi-Trao's ironfrog. Nonetheless, she is pleased to have your enduring support, and asks that you and Grenoldt lend the same kindness to Chora-Zoi. Her main matter of business completed, Mowen mentions that the two skilled smiths in question have returned to the Crystarium, and suggests that you follow suit."
3,"TEXT_AKTKCT201_04767_SEQ_03","You return to the Crystarium to find Grenoldt and Chora-Zoi reflecting on their brief excursion─Mowen has great expectations, but a distraught Chora-Zoi wonders if she can truly meet such lofty standards. With a few fiery words of encouragement, however, Grenoldt rallies you all for the Boutique's newest challenge, and the forges are stoked for a project of brilliant proportions."
