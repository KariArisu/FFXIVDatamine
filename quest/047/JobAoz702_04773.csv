1,"TEXT_JOBAOZ702_04773_SEQ_01","While catching up with Martyn, you are soon joined by Royse and P'yandih who come with concerning news─attendance at the Celestium has been on the decline. Hoping to uncover the reason why, Royse suggests speaking with the people of Ul'dah directly. She asks you survey the people of the Gold Court while she and the others inquire in the surrounding districts."
2,"TEXT_JOBAOZ702_04773_SEQ_02","A handful of townsfolk are willing to speak with you, and the reasons for their dissatisfaction with the Celestium are varied. What they seem to have in common, however, is a belief that greater challenges are needed for the blue mage performers. You can but wonder if this coincides with what Royse and the others have learned."
3,"TEXT_JOBAOZ702_04773_SEQ_03","Everyone has heard much of the same, and after a moment of consideration, Royse arrives at a conclusion: you are in need of a nemesis with whom you can do battle at the Celestium. Martyn has been tasked with finding this challenger, and to be certain they are a worthy rival, they must prove to be stronger than even himself. It is a laborious task that will take considerable time, which is why the blue mage suggests you continue your training in preparation. Until news of a potential candidate reaches P'yandih at the guild, he suggests mastering the spell Goblin Punch."
