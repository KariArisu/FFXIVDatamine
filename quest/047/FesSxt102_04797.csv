※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSXT102_04797_SEQ_01","Having failed to jog Clive's memories with a visit to Ul'dah, it has been decided that you shall journey next to Gridania. Although apparently unfamiliar with airship travel, the young man is eager to continue onward.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSXT102_04797_SEQ_02","Despite retaining knowledge of general concepts such as swords and combat techniques, Clive still struggles with the existence of functional airships. With great effort, he sets the infuriating inconsistency of his memory loss aside and devotes his energies to moving forward."
3,"TEXT_FESSXT102_04797_SEQ_03","As a newcomer to Gridania, Clive must rely on you to guide him around the city. The Carline Canopy should thus make for a logical first stop.

※You must be accompanied by Clive to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_FESSXT102_04797_SEQ_04","Upon entering the Carline Canopy, Clive is visited by a fragmented memory of a similar place...but nothing more. He looks to the tavern's exit, desperate to see more."
5,"TEXT_FESSXT102_04797_SEQ_05","The sight of a chocobo ignites a spark of recognition in Clive. He seems certain that he once had his own feathered mount, but can recall no other details. With little else forthcoming, you may as well continue onwards."
6,"TEXT_FESSXT102_04797_SEQ_06","Clive pauses at Gridania's aetheryte, wondering if the glittering construct could be a “Mothercrystal.” Quickly realizing that it is far too small, he sets his sights on the next point of potential interest."
7,"TEXT_FESSXT102_04797_SEQ_07","Upon approaching the Adders' Nest, Clive reacts strongly when a returning scout makes mention of the primal Garuda. After learning of Clive's situation, Commander Heuloix expresses his sympathies and offers to arrange a meeting with the Elder Seedseer, believing it to be the best hope for his recovery. The aforementioned scout bids you find him at Nophica's Altar when you are ready for your audience."
8,"TEXT_FESSXT102_04797_SEQ_08","Kan–E–Senna provides Clive with further details of Garuda's appearance and disposition, yet while he finds it all somewhat familiar, he cannot help but feel something is awry. Appearing as if from nowhere, the wandering minstrel proposes that this disconnect stems from the fact that Clive himself is not of this world─a conclusion reached after an extensive survey of the surrounding settlements turned up not even a single soul who had met their distinctively tattooed visitor before. Furthermore, the Elder Seedseer concludes that Clive's amnesia is not the result of illness or injury. Rather, she speculates he is suppressing some awful truth─one he must confront by breaking through a barrier of his own making."
9,"TEXT_FESSXT102_04797_SEQ_09","As Clive ponders his confounding dilemma, the wandering minstrel suggests that the heat of battle may provide the solution. Asked only to prepare for war, you are to await the enigmatic performer at Apkallu Falls."
