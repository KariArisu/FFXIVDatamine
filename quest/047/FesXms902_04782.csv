※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS902_04782_SEQ_01","Amh Garanjy can't wait to see you dressed up as the Saint of Nymeia─or, rather, she will wait forever until you are dressed up as the Saint of Nymeia. In an effort to avoid the crippling effects that eternity might have upon you both, you unfold the unorthodox saint's garments and make yourself presentable.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS902_04782_SEQ_02","In both style and spirit, you have become one with the Saint of Nymeia. Now it is time to carry out in deed what you have been tasked by appearance, so you make for the Greatloam Growery to pick up Tenny's gifts whenever they are ready."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS902_04782_SEQ_03","Tenny, with the help of Saulinne and a notably absent snowy-bearded gentleman, has completed crafting his presents: simple-yet-beautiful woven bracelets. He earnestly instructs you to seek out his friend Momolao, who should reliably be found playing near the Quicksand. Straightening your beard, be it literal or proverbial, you sally forth to deliver Tenny's precious offerings."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS902_04782_SEQ_04","Momolao is delighted with the gift, admitting that all of Tenny's friends have been unseasonably gloomy due to his recent move. You are directed towards the Gold Court and Milvaneth Sacrarium to find Larkin and Othuel, respectively, with the prediction that they will be nothing short of ecstatic to receive their presents."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS902_04782_SEQ_05","The painstakingly woven gifts have been delivered accordingly, affirming what you have always known─that distance means nothing in the face of true friendship. Bearing a physical representation of such a bond, you return to Gridania to deliver joyful tidings and a present for Tenny himself."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS902_04782_SEQ_06","Tenny is touched by his friends' thoughtfulness, with the realization that birds of a feather flock to bracelets together. Saulinne is relieved that the melancholy boy she was so worried about is now free to frolic with Starlight merriment as any good youngling should, and the two youths recognize the burgeoning friendship between them. You smile, reckoning that now is as good a time as any to apprise Amh Garanjy of the situation."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS902_04782_SEQ_07","There is little Amh Garanjy wishes for more than happy younglings, and your deeds have done much to deliver her such. Indeed, Saulinne and Tenny arrive to cheerfully extend their thanks and receive their Starlight presents. As you watch the youngsters scurry off to play, carefree and optimistic, you reflect upon your role in bringing their happiness to fruition. Perhaps it is too soon to hang your fur-trimmed hat after all..."
