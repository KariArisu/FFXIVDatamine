48,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_MANAGINGWAY_000_001","It's come to my attention that a number of our Ways have been working themselves to the bone in pursuit of fulfilling their dreams─indeed, some are reportedly overcome with fatigue."
49,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_MANAGINGWAY_000_002","I can understand the desire to devote one's all to realizing a goal, but to do so at the cost of one's very own health...it is not only doomed to lead to undue exhaustion, but it is all so very inefficient. I daresay some deft management is in order. "
50,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_MANAGINGWAY_000_003","As managing is what I do best, I would have you to coordinate with Ridingway yonder, and revitalize our weary comrades with the best cure for a pair of drooping ears: music."

52,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_RIDINGWAY_000_011","Well, nothing brings it out like music. Once they hear some merry melodies, the thought of exhaustion will be the furthest thing from their minds as the uncontrollable urge to move takes over."
53,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_RIDINGWAY_000_012","But don't let me keep you here with all this talk─you ought to get hopping! Board the moon-hopper here, and perform the hop-step when you come across any exhausted Ways. We're counting on you!"
54,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_RIDINGWAY_000_013","Seems the moon-hopper returned with some unexecuted protocols. Sorry for the trouble, but I'd appreciate it if you could hop back out there and continue to revitalize any exhausted Ways you find with the hop-step."
55,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_LOPORRIT04707A_000_020","<yawn> Oh, what I wouldn't do to curl up somewhere for a nice long nap. But the items for the shopping center...I must make more..."

57,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_LOPORRIT04707A_000_021","Wh-What thrilling music! I thought I couldn't move another step, but now I could skip to my hibernation chamber! Once I've had a few winks, I'll get back to making items!"
58,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_LOPORRIT04707B_000_022","<yawn> I-I can't remember the last time I slept... I've been working on new inventions day in and day out without even so much as a...as a... I don't even know. Ugh, curse my admiration for Inventingway and my sycophantic desire to be recognized!"

61,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_LOPORRIT04707B_100_023","You have my thanks. I never knew music could do such wonderful things, but now that I do, I shan't be wasting any more time with this “sleep” business. I have inventions to build! A boss to curry favor with! Failure to live in fear of! "

I was so weary I nearly forgot the joy I found in cooking. It is my dream, and as hard as it may be at times, it does truly bring me joy. I will continue to do my best! "
65,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_MANAGINGWAY_000_030","You are returned! Tell me, how did our exhausted Ways feel after hearing the music you played for them?"

67,"TEXT_BANLOP121_04707_MANAGINGWAY_000_032","Management takes many forms, and caring for one's health is but one of them. Alas, it would seem some of our Ways have yet to grasp the concept, and so I do fear I shall be calling upon your help again in the near future."
