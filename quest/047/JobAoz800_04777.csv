1,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_SEQ_01","Martyn is a bundle of nerves, but Royse is her customarily calm and cordial self, assuring you both that preparations at the Celestium are all but complete. She goes on to mention a special financial backer who helped to make the endeavor possible, insisting that you meet with them. To that end, she ushers the both of you to the Hustings Strip, hopeful they are yet lingering about."
2,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_SEQ_02","Royse's secret benefactor was none other than Godbert Manderville. Apparently, he has been offering financial support to the Celestium for quite some time. Upon hearing of her plans to incorporate a new performance into the Celestium's itinerary, he volunteered his full support to make Royse's dream a reality. He soon takes his leave, leaving the three of you to settle the matter of newly fashioned costumes and equipment for the show."
3,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_SEQ_03","Fitted with his golden armor and minions at his beck and call, Martyn is certain to push you to your limits as a blue mage. He has no intention of holding back, and so he asks that you answer his fervor in kind.

※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn after completing stage 32 of the Masked Carnivale."

51,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_MARTYN_000_001","Well, you'll be glad to know I'm duly rested from our venture to Ishgard. Still, I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't feelin' a little anxious."

66,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_GODBERT_000_025","As for my involvement with the Masked Carnivale, I have long supported Royse's enterprise at the Celestium. In fact, I believe it was around the time Typhon made their debut that I first offered her my services."
67,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_GODBERT_000_026","When she told me of her plans to seek out a worthy rival for the Carnivale's star performer, I knew at once no effort could be spared. And so, the sum total of my company's knowledge and know-how was leveraged to see her plans to fruition."

78,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_ROYSE_000_205","And the crystal there will further augment his magicks to ensure he is a match for our star."
79,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_ROYSE_000_206","Naturally, there will also be automata and familiars at his disposal, so you had best be on your guard, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."

86,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_ROYSE_000_213","Marvelous! Simply marvelous! The crowds will adore you."
87,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_PYANDIH_000_215","I must confess, this Goldor character suits Martyn quite well. "
88,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_MARTYN_000_220","Goldor, the diabolical. Goldor, the miserly. ...People don't really think of me as miserly, do they?"
89,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_PYANDIH_000_221","Don't worry about that, Martyn. People will love to hate you, I'm sure of it."
90,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_MARTYN_000_222","I'm not entirely sure if that's a good thing..."
91,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_MARTYN_000_223","But if this is the role I'm to play, you can be damn sure I'll give it my all."
92,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_MARTYN_000_224","And I suppose it was only a matter of time before you and I would go toe-to-toe, even if this isn't quite how I imagined it."
93,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_MARTYN_000_225","I won't be holdin' back, and don't expect you to, neither."
94,"TEXT_JOBAOZ800_04777_MARTYN_000_226","The incomparable Goldor─formerly known as Azuro the Third─will ever be at the ready. Just say the word!"
