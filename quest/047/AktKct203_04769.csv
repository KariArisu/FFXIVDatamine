Though the creation of her own tools has given her more confidence in her craft, the young smith is well aware that her labors with you and Grenoldt are far from complete. As if on cue, Grenoldt claims that he is ready to impart unto Chora-Zoi his secret techniques for the next steps of the tool enhancement process, and the two prepare once more to craft a tool that will breathe life into Norvrandt's trades.

Chora-Zoi insists that the brilliant light that shines within your tool is made possible by those who have supported her in this lengthy endeavor, and a wave of pride swells in the hearts of those present─yourself included. With another phase of the splendorous tools project complete, you revel in your progress, though in the back of your mind, you are almost certain that a day will soon come when Chora-Zoi seeks even further enhancements..."
