※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest. "
1,"TEXT_AKTKCT202_04768_SEQ_01","Though the hopes and dreams of Mowen and the Boutique are a heavy burden to bear, Chora-Zoi is bolstered by Grenoldt's moral support. This time, the legendary smithy is eager to have Chora-Zoi take the helm, and she resolves to craft a tool the likes of which Norvrandt has never seen. To do so, however, she must prepare another round of trade goods to begin the tool enhancement process, and entrusts you with the procurement of components from Quinnana.

※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

After what feels like several bells, the two return, and Chora-Zoi is proud to present you with her newest work. The moment you hold the tool in your hands, you feel a deep bond with it, and take a moment to appreciate the time and care it took to craft. Though a tool of this quality is a rare find indeed, you have a feeling there is still much work to be done as Chora-Zoi begins to consider further improvements."
