0,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_SEQ_00","Grenoldt is itching to celebrate Chora-Zoi's brilliant achievements."
1,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_SEQ_01","With a proud gleam in his eyes, Grenoldt reaffirms his gratitude for your myriad contributions to Chora-Zoi's works. He insists that words of thanks alone will not suffice, however, and offers to throw a commemorative feast at the Wandering Stairs for you and Chora-Zoi. Joined by Mowen and Quinnana, you savor this rare moment of respite, and watch with great interest as Grenoldt─unintentionally emboldened by a vintage he mistook for purple carrot juice─attempts to put his long-hidden feelings for Mowen into words before collapsing on the floor. With your efforts combined, the remaining four of you drag the legendary smith back to the Crystalline Mean, where you wait for him to come to his senses."
2,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_SEQ_02","Grenoldt's countenance sinks when he learns that Mowen has departed for Eulmore, and claims to have no memory of the feast. He regales you with a similarly shameful tale from his past of dizzying drinks, and though his regret is palpable, he is eager to return to the subject of Chora-Zoi's tools. Both master and apprentice are compelled to answer the call of perfection one last time in the name of the trades, and you cannot help but wonder─what could possibly lie in store beyond such brilliance?"

49,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_000_002","Ye did a damn fine job as well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. After all the blood, sweat, tears, an' components ye poured into this on our behalf, we owe ye more'n jus' a “thank ye” an' a pat on the back. I reckon it's high time we raise a glass to ye both in celebration."
50,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_CHORAZOI_000_003","Oh, that sounds like a wonderful idea, Master Grenoldt! I'd be glad to have a bit of respite, but I thought you weren't partial to ales and brews and whatnot? Are you sure you'll be all right?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_000_004","Ye've got a good memory, lass. But this celebration ain't for me, now, is it? The important part is that ye get out there an' enjoy yerselves. They serve a mean purple carrot juice at the Wanderin' Stairs, an' that'll do me jus' fine."
52,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_000_005","Speakin' o' which, are the two of ye ready to head on down? If I'm rememberin' right, Mistress Mowen should be finished with her usual dealings at Musica Universalis right about now, so we may as well ask her an' Quinnana to join in."
53,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_CHORAZOI_100_001","Ahem! I'd like to propose a toast. We've been down a very long and─dare I say it─splendorous road together. We've forged incredible tools, as well as lasting friendships, and I couldn't be more grateful for everyone's support. Today, we have more than earned the right to eat, drink, and be merry!"
54,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_100_002","Ahhh, a sight for me sore eyes... Haven't attended a gatherin' like this in ages. Reminds me o' the night we met, eh?"
55,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_100_003","The Stairs was full o' folk from all corners o' the realm, yet it seemed it were jus' the two of us. I can't rightly recall how many nights we spent after that, chattin' about our hopes an' dreams."
56,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_MOWEN_100_004","To think that we would find ourselves here once again...'twould seem the fates are kinder than I imagined. The day you departed on that long journey of yours, I feared I had forever lost my rough-spoken smith."
57,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_100_005","M-Mistress Mowen!"
58,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_100_006","I chose to walk the smitty's path so I could become a man what ye'd be proud of."
59,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_100_007","I haven't a single bleedin' regret about me progress as a craftsman. But I've never forgiven meself for leavin' ye waitin' on a Eulmoran terrace all these years. I wouldn't be surprised if ye resented me for it."
60,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_MOWEN_100_008","'Tis all in the past, Grenoldt! Never once have I resented you for your actions... I could never do such a thing."
61,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_100_009","Oh, Mistress Mowen... There's somethin' I've been too afraid to tell ye all these years, an' I can't hide it any longer!"
62,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_CHORAZOI_100_010","I-Is this what I think it is!?
Strike while the iron is hot, Master Grenoldt!"
63,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_QUINNANA_100_011","This is your moment, Mistress Mowen...!"
64,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_100_012","Mistress Mowen... Me dearest Mistress Mowen, I..."
65,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_CHORAZOI_100_013","Wait a moment, is this...wine? Has Master Grenoldt been drinking this instead of his purple carrot juice the whole time!?"
66,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_MOWEN_100_014","My dear, sweet Grenoldt... You haven't changed one bit."
67,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_MOWEN_100_015","Since the day you held your hammer aloft in pursuit of greatness, you have filled my heart with hope and pride. And in time, I pray you gain the courage to lay bare this secret you hold so closely."
68,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_000_030","Ugh, feels like me noggin's full o' sea slugs. I can't remember a bleedin' thing, but Miss Chora-Zoi tells me the lot of ye had to drag me sorry arse back to the Mean. I take it Mistress Mowen's made for Eulmore already?"
69,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_CHORAZOI_000_031","I'm afraid so...though she did say she'd return to the Crystarium when next the opportunity arose. I'm certain you'll have plenty of time to chat with her then!"
70,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_000_032","History repeats itself, an' it's got a cruel sense o' humor... A long time ago, Mistress Mowen an' I attended a similar banquet. I'd placed me flagon o' juice down for nary a second, but when I picked it back up to take a sip, I awoke the next day with a violent headache and the sour smack o' wine in me mouth."
71,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_000_033","A lesson to ye younger folk─never forget where ye leave yer juice... But embarrassin' anecdotes aside, there's work to be done. Miss Chora-Zoi's tool may have exceeded the Boutique's expectations, but summat tells me it's hidin' even more potential behind that brilliant gleam. Call it smitty's intuition."
72,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_000_034","I can't say what lies beyond the horizon, but if we draw out yer tool's full adaptive abilities, we may well be forgin' works fit for the gods themselves. It'll be gruelin' work...but there's no one better suited for the challenge than me earnest apprentice."
73,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_CHORAZOI_000_035","I'll make sure your faith in me is not misplaced, Master Grenoldt!"
74,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_000_036","Aye, that's what I like to hear! For now, it's back to the draftin' phase with us. We'll need all the time an' provisions we can afford."
75,"TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_GRENOLDT_000_037","I reckon we'll have our hands full for a while with the preparations, but when our plans are fully ironed out, ye'll be the first to know, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Until then, stay sharp, an' may yer tools be yer guidin' star!"
