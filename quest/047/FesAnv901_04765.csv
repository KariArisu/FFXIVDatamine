0,"TEXT_FESANV901_04765_SEQ_00","Kipih Jakkya is looking a worried sister.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESANV901_04765_SEQ_01","Kipih Jakkya, a reporter for <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>, was meant to meet her brother Nhagi'a during the Rising celebration, but the appointed hour has come and gone without him appearing. You are tasked with helping to find the lad, beginning by making inquiries at the Ruby Road Exchange.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESANV901_04765_SEQ_02","You learn from the locals that Nhagi'a is performing some manner of work for the wandering minstrel. Thus informed, you make your way to the Gold Court to find the musician."
3,"TEXT_FESANV901_04765_SEQ_03","The wandering minstrel tells you that he is hosting an exhibit called the letter forest, which displays anonymously penned letters of gratitude and encouragement. In order to collect letters from outside of Ul'dah, the man has dispatched a chocobo carriage with Nhagi'a as an escort. However, the carriage is late to return, and the minstrel apologetically asks you to conduct a search. Having thus found a likely lead, you bear the news to Kipih, who awaits you near the Quicksand."
4,"TEXT_FESANV901_04765_SEQ_04","You apprise Kipih of your findings. As the wandering minstrel suggested, you take yourselves to Black Brush Station to look for the carriage and Nhagi'a."
5,"TEXT_FESANV901_04765_SEQ_05","No sooner do you arrive at Black Brush Station than you learn from a traveling merchant that bandits have fallen upon a carriage over by the Clutch. Wasting no time, you and Kipih rush to the scene and scare the highwaymen away before they can overwhelm Nhagi'a. Thus are the siblings reunited─although Nhagi'a's utterance that he needs to grow stronger to gain Kipih's approval appears to give her pause. Nhagi'a then continues on to Ul'dah with the carriage to complete his delivery, and you and Kipih likewise head back to join the wandering minstrel at the Gold Court."
6,"TEXT_FESANV901_04765_SEQ_06","Reporting to the minstrel, Nhagi'a is critical of himself for needing your help to complete his task. His obsession with doing everything alone does not sit well with Kipih, who declares that she can't consent to his being an adventurer any longer. If he wishes to remain one, he must win her over─and it begins with pondering why he first embarked upon this path. Though saddened, Nhagi'a agrees to think on the matter and goes off, leaving you with the minstrel and a grim-faced Kipih."
7,"TEXT_FESANV901_04765_SEQ_07","Despite how it may have appeared, Kipih assures you that she wants her brother to succeed and be happy. However, she is worried that unless he changes his ways, he is likely to meet an early demise, or at best know an arduous life."
