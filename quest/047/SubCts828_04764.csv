1,"TEXT_SUBCTS828_04764_SEQ_01","Having heard of your research on the subject of scholars, and your newfound ability to summon a faerie familiar, Thubyrgeim hopes you might humor her with testing a theory. To that end she invites you downstairs to the guild's practice area."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS828_04764_SEQ_02","Following Thubyrgeim's instructions, after a brief moment of concentration, you call forth your faerie familiar, but she has taken the form of a Topaz Carbuncle. Satisfied to see her theory proven, Thubyrgeim invites you back upstairs."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS828_04764_SEQ_03","Thubyrgeim thanks you for the demonstration, encouraging you to make use of what you have learned."

54,"TEXT_SUBCTS828_04764_THUBYRGEIM_000_011","My apologies for the wait. As for what I wish for you to attempt, it is a technique similar to what you've already employed with your egi."

56,"TEXT_SUBCTS828_04764_THUBYRGEIM_000_013","How charming! The tales do little to capture its beauty."
57,"TEXT_SUBCTS828_04764_THUBYRGEIM_000_014","This faerie is no doubt manifested in the image of that which you most closely associate with faeries, but my research suggests this form is not immutable."
58,"TEXT_SUBCTS828_04764_THUBYRGEIM_000_015","Indeed, though a fundamental form may have been incorporated into the original incantation, with sufficient concentration, I believe it possible to supplant this form with the image of another entity. Try conjuring the faerie once more─this time, with a Carbuncle in your mind's eye."
