1,"TEXT_AKTKMM102_04752_SEQ_01","As you deliberate a suitable location for Wuk Lamat's hunt, Erenville mentions a petition for aid from researchers on the Isle of Haam. Some manner of predator has unsettled ordinarily docile animals, causing them to behave savagely, and the task involves identifying and dealing with the creature. Seeing an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, you all make your way to Scholar's Harbor to secure passage─with the exception of Krile, who promises to join you at the isle after she has seen to her preparations."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMM102_04752_SEQ_02","Upon making landfall on the Isle of Haam, you proceed through the wilderness and rescue researchers from unruly fauna. At length you arrive at the base of a great waterfall, where you confront the source of the animals' savage behavior: an enormous colibri."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMM102_04752_SEQ_03","The colibri fights ferociously, but you succeed in laying it low...or so you thought. The creature rises again and is poised to catch Wuk Lamat unawares when Krile finally arrives, and in a dazzling display of pictomancy, finishes off the unruly bird. With your work on the isle complete, you make your way back to Sharlayan, amply stocked with the meat of your worthy prey."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMM102_04752_SEQ_04","Upon arriving in Sharlayan, for want of options, Erenville suggests taking the colibri meat to the Last Stand. Hopefully, Dickon will be able to make something palatable out of it..."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMM102_04752_SEQ_05","You enjoy a hearty repast with Wuk Lamat, who takes the opportunity to speak more of her homeland and the coming ritual of succession. It becomes clear that her chief aim in seeking the throne is to deny the ambitions of another claimant─a warmonger who aspires to lead Tural's armies on a campaign of conquest. Reiterating her desire for you to join her cause, she says that she will remain in Sharlayan for as long as she can while awaiting your decision."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMM102_04752_SEQ_06","Though Erenville is less than impressed with Wuk Lamat in certain ways, he appears to believe in her cause. Whether you choose to lend your strength to it, however, is entirely your decision. The gleaner then goes off to report the mission's success to the guildship, leaving you to ponder your invitation to Tural."
