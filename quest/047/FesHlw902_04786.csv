※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW902_04786_SEQ_01","Papa Gruff decides that the best course of action will be to split up. Claiming responsibility for the troubled botanist and lingering voidsent in the Greatloam Growery, he sends you off towards eastern Gridania, where he senses more voidsent lurk. Wand in hand, you sally forth to flush out the lingering spooks with your pumpkin-producing All Saints' Charm.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW902_04786_SEQ_02","The city is free of voidsent, and the burgeoning wave of terror is transformed into a shower of happiness as Gridania's citizens delight in the show you give them. With your task complete, all that is left is to report your success to Papa Gruff at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW902_04786_SEQ_03","Papa Gruff was as successful as you were, and just as the pumpkin-headed apparition is chuckling her approval, the once-frightened botanist approaches you with her guildmaster, offering both thanks and a batch of pumpkin cookies. The clown is so taken with the flavor of gratitude that he becomes more committed than ever to spending this All Saints' Wake delivering shriek-accompanied smiles. Glowing with the satisfaction of her plan seen to fruition, the pumpkin-headed apparition asks you to relate all that has happened to the Adventurers' Guild investigator, in hopes he may direct his suspicious gaze elsewhere."
4,"TEXT_FESHLW902_04786_SEQ_04","Although you attempt to explain that the pumpkin-headed apparition only has Gridania's best interests at heart, the investigator remains convinced that some ulterior motive guides her actions. He will continue to keep an eye on the festivities, but fortunately relieves you of your duty, leaving you free to enjoy All Saints' Wake at your leisure."
