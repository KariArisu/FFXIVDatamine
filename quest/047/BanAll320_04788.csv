As alternative duties likely involve cleaning up after terrified hippos being transported beyond the boundaries of their known world, you readily agree."
2,"TEXT_BANALL320_04788_SEQ_02","Upon inquiring with N-7000, you learn that the previous commotion was the patrons' sudden and fervent desire to join the upcoming race─it seems that they have all gone off to prepare their own vehicles while Last Dregs employees and the Dreaming Ways set up for the contest. N-7000 indicates that Inventingway wishes to consult you about a related matter, and thus do you set off for Base Omicron to seek him out."

Though several racers are knocked off of the course, you deftly avoid its perils and glide to the front of the pack.

6,"TEXT_BANALL320_04788_SEQ_06","Back at the Last Dregs, Jammingway congratulates you on your victory by way of an enormous trophy. The other participants will also not be going home empty-handed, as the Dreaming Ways have provided new radios for diners in both the nekropolis and Svarna. Though the Hyper Hustle will soon be but a fond memory, you know in your heart that reasons to rejoice in this wide, wide universe are never-ending."
