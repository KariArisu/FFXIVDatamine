1,"TEXT_AKTKRA302_04757_SEQ_01","With some encouragement, Ruissenaud and Nemjiji overcome their initial fright and introduce themselves to your allies from the ancient age. Although both sides have countless questions they could ask the other, they focus their efforts on coming up with a plan to foil Athena. While they share knowledge of the present and memories of the past, you are to begin your advance into Pandæmonium."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA302_04757_SEQ_02","Erichthonios advises you to first secure the entrance to Pandæmonium, that he and Lahabrea might safely join your exploration of the facility. When you approach, you are greeted by a familiar face: Themis. Like Lahabrea and Erichthonios, he has been recreated by Athena's hand, though with more combat potential and less free will, if his words are to be believed. Not moments after this unsettling revelation, the spires of Pandæmonium twist into a monstrous foe─the better for Athena to test your scientifically improbable strength."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA302_04757_SEQ_03","With Themis having vanished, you are left to face Pandæmonium's wrath alone. You know not what sort of soul inhabits its monstrous facade, but it is certain to be unmerciful.

5,"TEXT_AKTKRA302_04757_SEQ_05","Themis reappears to congratulate you on your victory, as do Lahabrea and Erichthonios, having belatedly secured safe passage through the dark energy surrounding Pandæmonium. Before disappearing once more, Themis beckons you through the strange gate that has manifested where the prison once stood, leaving you and your companions with myriad questions."
6,"TEXT_AKTKRA302_04757_SEQ_06","It seems that while you were battling Pandæmonium, Nemjiji and Ruissenaud apprised Lahabrea and Erichthonios of major events from the past several millennia. Armed with knowledge of the Ultima Weapon and beyond, the ancient pair theorize that Athena stored her memories within the Heart of Sabik, which it transpires was created by none other than the megalomaniacal chief keyward herself. The Heart magnified the desires of its users to a fanatical degree, but by the time its dangers became apparent, it was too late. Lahabrea was forced to kill his wife, and though he closely guarded the Heart of Sabik to prevent the spread of its influence, it was this very caution that allowed Athena's memory to survive. With but one path before you, you must press forward to where Themis─and Athena─await."
