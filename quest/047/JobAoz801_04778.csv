0,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_SEQ_00","Unfortunately for Martyn, you proved every onze the blue mage he hoped you might."
1,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_SEQ_01","Thanks to your near-peerless prowess as a blue mage, Martyn received a sound thrashing in the Celestium, and not an empty seat could be found in the stands. There was still the matter of Martyn's pay to resolve, but that also proved a defeat for the budding villain, even if he was not entirely aware of it. While willing to make an exception for you, Martyn has no intention of losing to any other blue mage who might issue him challenge, and so resolves to hone his skills in other schools of magic."
2,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_SEQ_02","You have come far in your training as a blue mage, but Martyn is not yet convinced that you are a match for him...in his chosen discipline, at least. And so he bids you set out and explore the world over to seek new knowledge and discover the boundless potential of blue magic."

49,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_PYANDIH_000_001","You were incredible, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Every spell cast was more mesmerizing than the last─a spectacle for the ages!"
50,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_100_001","I imagine Royse agrees. Speakin' of whom..."
51,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_ROYSE_000_002","Well done, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Well done, indeed! There was not an empty seat to be seen in the Celestium."
52,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_ROYSE_000_003","And you, Martyn. You may have lost in the arena, but I daresay this success is just as much yours as it is <If(PlayerParameter(4))>hers<Else/>his</If>."
53,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_004","Well, there was only so much I could do without my blue magic. It's like fightin' with my hands tied behind my back."
54,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_PYANDIH_000_005","Surely there was something you could have done with the added armor, the crystal, the automata, <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> the familiars to help you."
55,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_006","Ah, before I forget. Royse. I've been meanin' to talk to you about the terms of my position as showmaster."
56,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_007","As I recall, I'm to receive three and a half percent of all earnings from any event featurin' <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s nemesis, is that right?"
57,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_ROYSE_000_008","Yes, you were─if you were the showmaster. It would be remiss of me to burden you with the position when you already fight opposite our star performer. You will still receive the payment commensurate with your role in the show, of course."
58,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_009","But...my title. My commission..."
59,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_ROYSE_000_010","Well, I suppose technically you <Emphasis>did</Emphasis> find <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> nemesis, and you've saved us the trouble of hiring new staff."
60,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_ROYSE_000_011","The Celestium can afford you...one percent of the earnings."
61,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_012","Three percent!"
62,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_ROYSE_000_013","Surely, you jest!"
63,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_014","Two, then!"
64,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_ROYSE_000_015","One and a half. My final offer."
65,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_ROYSE_000_016","With that settled, there is paperwork to be drawn up, and a number of other duties that yet want for tending. I look forward to your next appearance in the Masked Carnivale."
66,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_PYANDIH_100_016","Despite his menacing persona as Goldor, he's still quite sheepish when it comes to negotiations."
67,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_100_017","Hm? What's that supposed to mean?"
68,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_PYANDIH_000_017","Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Ah, I had better be going as well. If I'm ever to be a match for the <Emphasis>dreaded</Emphasis> Goldor, I had best get back to my training!"
69,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_018","Bein' the Celestium's star performer and all, I'm willin' to make exceptions for you, but I won't stand for anymore of my students bestin' me in the Masked Carnivale. Looks like I had better brush up on my magicks as well."
70,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_019","And as strange as it sounds, playin' the villain's been quite liberatin'─a chance to break my usual decorum and throw caution to the wind."
71,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_020","Maybe someday you'll feel inclined to take a walk on the dark side too, eh?"
72,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_021","Just know that if you do..."
73,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_022","You'll have to contend not with Martyn, but the incomparable Azuro the Third!"
74,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_030","I hope you won't let your victory over Goldor go to your head. You've still a long way to go before your blue magic is a match for mine."
75,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_031","For that, you'll need to expand your horizons even further. Remember: there's a big wide world out there."
76,"TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_MARTYN_000_032","So explore, seek new knowledge, and the boundless potential of blue magic will be yours to master."
