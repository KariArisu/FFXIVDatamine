They are fresh out of inspiration at the moment, however, leading you to suggest that they consult with their most creative of kin: the Loporrits in Hoper's Hold."

Alas, though they find many activities to tempt a Loporrit such as themself, they see naught that would uniformly suit the diverse café-goers of Ultima Thule. Not wont to give up so easily, they resolve to consult Dreamingway, who may yet have big ideas up his tiny sleeve."
3,"TEXT_BANALL310_04787_SEQ_03","Dreamingway, for his part, suggests calling upon Talkingway's knowledge of events on Etheirys, accumulated via letters from the radio station's listeners. Doing so yields a promising lead─the Hippo Riders' Hannish Hippo Hustle has become the talk of Thavnair and beyond. Convinced that such an event is guaranteed to excite even the most nihilistic of Last Dregs patrons, Jammingway insists that you speak to Trna about taking her hippos on the intergalactic road immediately."

You are joined shortly by none other than Acala, who is ill content to let Trna decline an opportunity to pursue her passion for racing. He encourages you to remind her that she has a whole team of enthusiastic Hippo Riders eager to share her burdens, as she has always shared theirs."
6,"TEXT_BANALL310_04787_SEQ_06","Inspired by Acala's sincerity, you appeal to Trna's innate zest for adventure and trust in her team. Though she is stubborn to the last, you ultimately convince her to follow the siren song of the racetrack to parts unknown."
