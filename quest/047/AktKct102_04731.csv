※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_AKTKCT102_04731_SEQ_01","Chora-Zoi has been looking over Grenoldt's plans to improve the base splendorous tool, and could not be more excited to begin the process. Before augmenting anything, however, there is the small matter of preparing suitable trade goods...which can then be exchanged for the rare and expensive components procured by the Boutique of Splendors. This, according to Grenoldt, is to be your job. Once you are done trading wares to Quinnana, Chora-Zoi will be waiting to take charge of both materials and tool for the next step of this splendorous endeavor.

※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_AKTKCT102_04731_SEQ_02","You entrust the splendorous tool and rare materials to Chora-Zoi, and, under Grenoldt's watchful eye, she succeeds in effecting the desired improvements. The already masterful piece feels somehow more natural in your hand─a testament to the young artisan's consummate skill. With the first stage complete, you look forward to how the next stage of improvements will transform your tool of the trade."
