1,"TEXT_SUBCTS829_04795_SEQ_01","According to Singingway, aetherial waves with rhythmic signatures have been detected on the moon, with Heimdall's Last Sight as their source. Having found a seasoned explorer of Allagan ruins in you, and a master bard who can interpret the melodic readings in the wandering minstrel, Singingway hopes to uncover whatever message may be hidden in the emanations. So it is that your newly formed party of three agree to rendezvous in Sinus Lacrimarum."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS829_04795_SEQ_02","Handing you an amplifier, Singingway instructs you to search for the origin of the aetherial emanations in the vicinity of Heimdall's Last Sight. Once found, you are to install the device to amplify the source's signal."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS829_04795_SEQ_03","After a short search, you have found the source of the emanations atop the Heimdall-class vessel and installed the amplifier. Singingway will undoubtedly wish to hear of this."
4,"TEXT_SUBCTS829_04795_SEQ_04","Analysis of the emanations reveals that for the countless millennia in which Bahamut was imprisoned within Dalamud, he sung only of his desire for vengeance...or so you are initially led to believe. Further parsing of the data reveals a secret song of hope, drowned out by the Allagans in a twisted plot to fuel the elder primal's rage. Disturbed by this revelation, Singingway wishes to realize Bahamut's true dream─to fly and be free─even if a surrogate must inherit it. As it so happens, the wandering minstrel possesses an apocryphal horn capable of manifesting such a being."
5,"TEXT_SUBCTS829_04795_SEQ_05","With the power of the phantom familiars you have gathered in your travels serving as a font of aether for the ritual, you blow upon the horn, and an entity bearing a likeness to Bahamut materializes before your eyes. The wandering minstrel is inspired with a new verse on the very spot, and weaves a song which chronicles this miracle, that it may be passed down through the ages. Atop this familiar born of hope, may your adventures be boundless as the heavens."
