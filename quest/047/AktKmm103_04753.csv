Upon hearing of Tuliyollal, a nation composed of myriad disparate tribes, Alphinaud believes it to be precisely the example they seek. Alisaie, however, is apparently not satisfied with merely reading, and immediately goes off to make new plans, leaving her brother chasing after her. With your research concluded, you and G'raha Tia turn your steps back to the Baldesion Annex."

Yet you are far from the only one, for Alphinaud and Alisaie soon arrive and express their desire to help as well. Wuk Lamat happily welcomes the twins into the fold before also volunteering a none-too-eager Erenville to her cause, while G'raha Tia, noticing Krile's indecision, convinces her to seize the opportunity to visit Tural. Thus is your team assembled, and you fix your gaze upon your distant destination."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMM103_04753_SEQ_07","Now that the journey is decided, all that remains is to prepare for the moment of departure. What manner of trials awaits on the shores of Tural, you know not, but your heart swells with anticipation at the promise of a grand new adventure.

※The next main scenario quest will be available from Ojika Tsunjika once you have met the following requirements:
※FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail must be registered to your service account.
※You must have completed the main scenario quest “The Coming Dawn.”"
