※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSXT101_04796_SEQ_01","After being accosted by a neophyte adventurer, you find yourself in the presence of the infamous wandering minstrel. The itinerant tale-teller shares with you a dream he had─supposedly prophetic in nature─which seems to foretell your meeting with a metaphorical “scarlet star” in some fiery landscape. Deeming the Burning Wall the closest match to this vision, he bids you accompany him to eastern Thanalan, where he hopes to witness the denouement to his celestial vision.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSXT101_04796_SEQ_02","The minstrel waxes philosophical for a time before returning to the matter at hand. He suggests using a spyglass to scan the surrounding terrain from the nearby vantage point. If there is indeed meaning to his dream, you may spy something unusual..."
3,"TEXT_FESSXT101_04796_SEQ_03","You spot the crumpled form of a young man, and upon rushing over to render aid, you learn that his name is Clive and that he has no memory of how he arrived at the Burning Wall. The minstrel offers to escort Clive to the Phrontistery, where a physician might more closely assess his condition. There is little more for you to do but make your way to Scholars' Walk and wait."
4,"TEXT_FESSXT101_04796_SEQ_04","Clive informs you that while he is in good physical health, he is as yet unable to remember recent events─or much at all, for that matter. Unwilling to abandon one in such a vulnerable state, you and the minstrel agree to assist Clive with recovering his missing memories."
5,"TEXT_FESSXT101_04796_SEQ_05","Clive thanks you for your kind assistance. Although troubled by his mental fugue, he nevertheless seems willing to delay departure until you give the word."
