※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST901_04721_SEQ_01","Jihli Aliapoh welcomes you to this most auspicious celebration of Hatching–tide, inspired by her annual prophetic dreams of the legendary Twelve Archons. She admits that this year's vision was rather peculiar because it featured tonberries, creatures of myth known less for their seasonal whimsy and more for their habit of mercilessly stabbing things. This dream proved prophetic indeed, when sylphs descended upon Gridania, dismantling decorations, harassing residents, and otherwise making a nuisance of themselves. These mischievous creatures are deathly afraid of the tonberries' wilting (yet adorable?) gaze, and with the help of a self-proclaimed tonberry connoisseur named Hamlyn, Jihli Aliapoh's volunteers have donned tonberry costumes to scare off the sylphs. They are shorthanded, however, and Hamlyn just so happens to have a costume in your size...

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

While this is not how you anticipated spending your Hatching–tide, you comfort yourself with the knowledge that you will be enjoying the festivities in no time.

※You must be wearing the tonberry guise to complete this task."

4,"TEXT_FESEST901_04721_SEQ_04","After pawing you out of the tonberry guise again, Hamlyn bids you share your report with Jihli. The eyes of his tonberry mask glint as he clutches your slightly sweaty costume in both hands. Best not to think too hard about it."
5,"TEXT_FESEST901_04721_SEQ_05","Jihli is delighted to hear that the sylphs' mischief has been thwarted and that festival preparations are once more proceeding apace, but Nonotta shatters this brief reprieve with panicked reports of mayhem in the Central Shroud. The caravan of Archon eggs─a most crucial decoration─has been beset upon by angry sylphs and the delivery mammet is malfunctioning in its attempt to prevent total highroad robbery. In this moment of distress, Hamlyn giggles his delight, as he claims to have a brilliant plan that is sure to save the day. You need only ask..."
