Nananji desires more information for Louisoix's biography."
1,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_SEQ_01","At the Drowning Wench, Nananji expresses his desire to know what motivated Louisoix to go so far as to sacrifice himself for a land not his own. If he had people near him in his final moments, the writer muses, they may be able to provide some insights─and by a fortuitous turn, Baderon, who chances to overhear your conversation, happens to know an individual who served among the Archon's guard at Carteneau. Known by the name of Orn Guincum, this former officer of the Maelstrom has since turned to adventuring, and there is a possibility he is presently at the Moraby Drydocks. Upon learning of this, Nananji immediately sets off, eager not to miss the opportunity to speak with the man.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_SEQ_02","Upon arriving at the Drydocks, Nananji proposes splitting up to make inquiries after Orn. Hopefully, someone in the area can lead you to him."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_SEQ_03","Piecing together the information from the locals, you believe you know where Orn may be found. Armed with the knowledge, you go to rejoin Nananji."
4,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_SEQ_04","You share with Nananji your finding that Orn may have bought a Nymeia lily, and thence took himself to the mark of the Spinner nearby. Wasting no time, the two of you hurry to the area."
5,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_SEQ_05","At the end of your search, you and Nananji come face-to-face with Orn Guincum. Recognizing you as the hero of Operation Archon, the man agrees to tell you his tale, and in grim tones recounts Louisoix's final moments. Even when Bahamut had broken free and all hells loose, he and his fellow guards were determined to stay at the Archon's side to the bitter end. Their charge, however, had beseeched them not to sacrifice themselves here, but to live and bear the light for others to follow. “Every soul who lives to determine their own fate is a source of hope”─with these words ringing in his mind, Nananji is reaffirmed in his belief that Louisoix was not an all-powerful savior one reads about in tales, but merely an ordinary man. Yet that man never forsook Eorzea, and stood for this realm to the last that all might know a brighter future. In this way, the budding writer has found not only an angle for Louisoix's biography, but newfound determination to tell the great man's tale."
6,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_SEQ_06","In response to Nananji's thanks, Orn offers thanks of his own for being afforded the chance to share Louisoix's words. The erstwhile lieutenant then takes his leave and wishes you well on your travels. Having seen the man off, Nananji suggests returning to Ul'dah, where he would present you with your reward."
7,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_SEQ_07","Speaking in front of the Hall of Flames, Nananji expresses his gratitude at being able to hear the accounts of those who lived the Calamity. He also declares that he has attained a measure of closure, having realized through his inquiries that Louisoix had fought with his all as simply another defender of the realm. Though much work remains to be done, Nananji promises that he will not rest until the biography goes to print, and you look forward to the day every man, woman, and child may know the tale of the great Archon."

50,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_000_003","But tell me─based on what you've heard from our interviewees, what is your opinion of Louisoix?"
51,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
52,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_A1_000_001","He's an exceptional leader."
53,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_A1_000_002","He had a difficult task."
54,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_A1_000_003","Others deserve more credit."
55,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_000_004","I agree, he possessed great leadership. If not, he couldn't have established the framework to realize his plans, no matter how brilliant they may have been."
56,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_000_005","Indeed. From an imperial invasion to rampaging primals to Nael van Darnus's scheme, he had to contend with the toughest of problems."
57,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_000_006","Perhaps. Without the Warriors of Light, his plans may have come to naught. But without Louisoix himself, there wouldn't have been any plan at all."
58,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_000_007","What struck me was how grateful the interviewees were to Louisoix for bringing their nations together in cooperation. It was nothing short of necessary for our survival."
59,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_000_010","Yet in knowing this, I can't help but wonder. In his capacity as a tactician, it seems to me he had done more than enough by devising a plan and facilitating its execution."
60,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_100_010","He went far beyond that, risking life and limb on the front lines for a land not his own. Perhaps he needed to be there for the ritual. Perhaps he felt a sense of duty... "
61,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_000_011","Even so, as noble as it is to desire to help others, what good is it if you end up sacrificing yourself? "
62,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_000_012","What was it that compelled Louisoix to go to Carteneau, and what went through his mind as the battle unfolded? In order to do his biography justice, I feel I need to know these things."
63,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_NANANJI_000_013","If Louisoix had people near him at the time, perhaps he shared words with them in his final moments─words that could provide some insights. But where to begin searching for such individuals, assuming they exist...?"

66,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_BADERON_000_016","Aye, an' far as I'm aware, 'e wasn't keepin' the fact a secret. Jus' fer good measure, though─why do ye wants to speak with him?"

78,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_MOBA04780_000_034","He said that he wanted to buy flowers, so I directed him to a vendor. Not sure where he is as of now, though."
79,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_MOBA04780_100_034","Ever since the Calamity, Orn's been helping people across the realm rebuild. It's a fine thing and all, but with his skills, I reckon he could do far better than menial labor."

98,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_ORN_000_506","As you know, the battle was fought over the land where Dalamud was expected to fall. In the beginning, neither side was able to gain the upper hand. But when the imperials deployed their magitek armor, our ranks were thrown into disarray."
99,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_ORN_000_507","Those charged with protecting Louisoix like me could only watch the carnage from afar. And though our forces managed to hold out thanks to the adventurer contingent, we sustained grievous casualties."
100,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_ORN_000_508","But the real tragedy was what followed. As Dalamud hurtled towards us, it began shedding fragments of itself before finally bursting open to unleash the primal Bahamut."
101,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_ORN_000_509","As all below looked on in shock, the battle completely forgotten, Bahamut took wing and spewed fire all over the land. Men and magitek armor alike were set ablaze and sent flying like so many insects."
102,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_ORN_000_510","I only realized that I had stopped breathing when a commanding voice broke my trance. “You've done enough,” Louisoix told us. “Now fly! Fly and save yourselves!”"
103,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_ORN_000_511","But like my fellow guards, I wanted to remain. I couldn't charge into battle beside my comrades; at the very least, I would do my duty here and protect Louisoix to the last."
104,"TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_ORN_000_512","But upon seeing us standing there, not making to move, Louisoix smiled and spoke thus: “If you would give your lives to protect something, then protect my hopes.”"
