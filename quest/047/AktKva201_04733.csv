His letter bids you make for Hingashi to join in an expedition to Mount Rokkon. Though his ingratiating tone leaves much to be desired, the destination in question has never before been seen by ijin eyes, and so it seems a trip to Kugane is in order, that you might learn more of this rare opportunity."
2,"TEXT_AKTKVA201_04733_SEQ_02","No sooner do you arrive at the Bokairo Inn than are you approached by the irrepressible Hancock, flanked by a pair of unfamiliar Hingan faces. Tsubaki and Tokimori are servants of the lord who presides over the lands containing Mount Rokkon, upon the slopes of which sits a monastery that has been overrun by spirits known as mononoke. Though Hancock is driven by his interest in the accursed treasures responsible for this infestation, the others are clearly concerned for the welfare of the smallfolk in the region. For an accomplished slayer of gods, the exorcision of a few unruly demons is surely not an unreasonable imposition..."
3,"TEXT_AKTKVA201_04733_SEQ_03","Ere you board the falcon that will take you deeper into Shishu, Tsubaki urges you to take every precaution for the trials that lie ahead. You steel yourself for an uphill climb, knowing that one false step may leave you at the mercy of foes from Hingan myth.
