106,"TEXT_SUBCTS680_04715_ANDEN_000_066","True... I must say, that is surprisingly thoughtful for someone who was tee-hee-ing at my distress not moments ago. But if you can't tell me anything, how do you intend to help?"

108,"TEXT_SUBCTS680_04715_EOTYR_000_068","I'll give you little hints and pieces, instead. Like this─do you remember being a shepherd, Anden? You so loved your fluffy white sheep."
109,"TEXT_SUBCTS680_04715_EOTYR_000_069","You loved them so much, in fact, that even those scary sin eaters couldn't drive you away from your flock. You stayed and cared for them until the very end."
110,"TEXT_SUBCTS680_04715_ANDEN_000_070","Really!? I confess, I don't remember anything of the sort..."
111,"TEXT_SUBCTS680_04715_ANDEN_000_071","...But if you speak the truth, perhaps seeing tools or materials a shepherd might use would induce further recollection!"
112,"TEXT_SUBCTS680_04715_ANDEN_000_072","Not much of a lead, but it's all we have at the moment. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, would you be kind enough to procure me some items fit for a shepherd?"
113,"TEXT_SUBCTS680_04715_EOTYR_100_073","We'll help too! Lor Ul and Aenc Ose love playing shop, so be sure to check their wares for both handy <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> dandy bits, bobs, and supplies."
114,"TEXT_SUBCTS680_04715_EOTYR_100_074","Lately, Lor Ul has been fascinated with what you mortals call “scrips,” but sweet Aenc Ose will be happy to take your shiny coin just the same. Oh, what fun we shall have! I can hardly wait to get started."
