※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_01","Lyonell informs Haermaga that you have agreed to help him learn the ins and outs of helping those in need. The chaperone is keen on this idea, and instructs him to keep watch over the revelers on the northeastern shores of Costa del Sol. Your task is to help the youth spot any signs of trouble, and offer advice on how best to keep the peace.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_02","With your steady hand to guide him, Lyonell can now count several deeds of heroism of his own. Every savior needs rest, however, and Beaudefoin soon arrives to take over watch duty. The youth is eager to share tidings of his success with Haermaga and asks you to accompany him."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_03","Haermaga is pleased with Lyonell's progress, and explains that his costume is modeled after the Phoenix of legend. Just like that legendary bird, the chaperone hopes that Lyonell can be reborn, and thus recover his lost confidence. This hope is soon tested when an enormous shark emerges from the ocean depths, and Lyonell is forced to drive it back in an impressive display of bravery. After the fight, Lyonell stands dumbfounded at his own actions, and you somehow get the feeling he may require one final nudge in the right direction."
4,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_04","Your presence returns Lyonell to his senses, and he is at last able to look the people he saved in the eyes. While he seems to have suffered no more than surface wounds, Haermaga instructs him to get checked nonetheless. The chairman asks you to join him in awaiting Lyonell's return, while you both keep watch for any further fiends."
5,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_05","Lyonell returns with a triumphant smile on his face. For your part in bringing the young adventurer into his own, Haermaga makes you an honorary Sunshine Savior, rewarding you with the selfsame costume that gave Lyonell the confidence for heroics. You are now free to enjoy the Moonfire Faire and all its pleasures, for the savior of the sands' watch has only just begun."
