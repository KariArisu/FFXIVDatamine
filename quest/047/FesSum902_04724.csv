※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_01","Reeve informs Haermaga that he has asked you to help him learn the ins and outs of helping people in need. The chaperone is keen on this idea, and revises Reeve's tasks, instructing him to keep watch over the people celebrating on the northeastern shores of Costa Del Sol. There, you are to offer advice on who is most in need of a heroic rescue, and how exactly Reeve should go about it.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_02","With your steady hand to guide him, Reeve is able to leave the shores of Costa Del Sol even safer than they were when he arrived. Every savior needs rest, however, and Beaudefoin soon arrives to take over watch duty. Reeve is eager to share tidings of his success with Haermaga, and asks you to accompany him."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_03","Haermaga is pleased with Reeve's progress, and explains that his costume is modeled after the phoenix of legend. Just like that legendary bird, the chaperone hopes that Reeve can be reborn, and thus recover his lost confidence. This hope is soon tested when a shark appears on Costa Del Sol, and Reeve drives it back in a display of bravery that could move even the most cold-hearted miser. After the fight, Reeve stands dumbfounded at his own actions─he may require your help one final time to be led in the right direction."
4,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_04","Your arrival returns Reeve to his senses, and he is at last able to meet the eyes of the people he has just saved. While he looks to have suffered no more than surface wounds, Haermaga instructs him to visit the healer's tent. The chaperone asks you to stay behind to keep watch for any further fiends."
5,"TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_05","Your watch is uneventful, and Reeve returns with mask doffed and a smile on his face. For your part on bringing the young adventurer into his own, Haermaga makes you an honorary Sunshin Savior, rewarding you with the selfsame costume that gave Reeve the confidence for heroics. You are now free to enjoy the Moonfire Faire and all its pleasures, for the savior of the sands watches over you."
