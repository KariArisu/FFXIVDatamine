49,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_001","Though having said “we,” I must admit that Pasasun deserves the lion's share of the credit. But he would <Emphasis>never</Emphasis> have been in a position to do so had I not risked life and limb to set these events in motion!"
50,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_002","Anyway, he unearthed an ancient document which makes mention of the fish, and for this accomplishment we are now better informed."
51,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_PASASUN_000_003","Oh, do my ears deceive me? Praise from the beak of the exalted Kalika? I'm surprised you even remembered my name."
52,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_004","I give thanks when it is due! But this is all beside the point. Upon learning of this fish's properties, Master Matsya realized that one other than Mistress Nidhana has greater need of it."
53,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_005","Moreover, he desires that you be there for the presentation. And since fate has placed you before us, what better time to hand over the fish than this very moment?"

55,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_007","As a servant of the Speaker, I am well versed in matters of etiquette. To those who have aided me I afford an appropriate measure of respect─nothing more, nothing less."

57,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_PASASUN_000_009","I've grown accustomed to Kalika's barbs. There's an odd charm about them, even. Still, it warms my heart to hear him speak sincere praise."
58,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_015","Thank you for meeting us, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I apologize for making you wait, but we had good reason..."
59,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_016","These three were lying in wait for us on the road. Couldn't let bygones be bygones, it seems. Fortunately, the Radiant Host intervened before anyone came to harm."

64,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_JJHIMEI_000_021","But you sure didn't pull your punches when you trounced our poor minion, did you? Do you know how long Whasbyrm spent with his nose buried in dusty tomes just so he could learn how to control it? So much wasted effort..."
65,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_WHASBYRM_000_022","Sorry for all the trouble... There were writings in the ruins that detailed rituals. Incredibly complex magicks unlike anything I'd ever seen...and my curiosity got the better of me."
66,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_ARMY04790_000_023","Keep walking! I don't want to hear another word out of you lot until we reach the capital."
67,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_024","Well, whatever punishment is to be meted out, it will be well deserved! The Speaker must have sensed their ill intent and rose to defend the jewel."
68,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_Q1_000_025","What will you say?"
69,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_A1_000_001","Do you know anything else about the Speaker?"
70,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_A1_000_002","What's so special about that jewel?"
71,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_026","I am afraid I know little more than you. Though I am sworn to serve, the Speaker does not deign to share with me its secrets."
72,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_027","I can tell you only of legends passed down through generations. Of biting frost that turned seas to ice, which drove the Speaker's makers to go forth in search of a haven where light shone bright."
73,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_028","Those who came long after found Aloalo, where life had weathered the ancient rime. At the island's heart was the Speaker, its jewel flawless and radiant."
74,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_029","'Twas a wellspring of vitality, they believed, and all who settled upon Aloalo came to revere the ancient builders and their enduring legacy."
75,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_030","Under the Speaker's auspices, the people of Aloalo lived in peace for thousands of years, until the day flame and ash rose from the water and forced them to flee."
76,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_031","Just how old are you, Kalika? You speak of eras so ancient that they are as myth to us."
77,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_032","Your guess is as good as mine, Master Matsya! I remember well when the island was bustling and vibrant, its inhabitants dedicated to esoteric equations and other cultural pursuits. Some even attempted to unravel the mysteries of the Speaker and its jewel."
78,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_033","I was born in the great shrine, this much I know. When the people found me, I spoke to them in their own tongue─they were beside themselves in disbelief! Thus was I deemed the Speaker's servant."
79,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_034","Why can I speak? Well, having given it much thought, I can only surmise that the jewel is the reason. But enough about me, Master Matsya. Tell <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> what we learned of the fish you plucked from the shrine's waters."
80,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_035","Kalika told me that the fish from the shrine were given to the island's younglings to help them grow hale and hearty. At first, I was unsure if that was merely a custom, or if there was actually something special about them."
81,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_036","Pasasun found the answer. He unearthed ancient records detailing the fish's medicinal properties─namely, its ability to bolster the body's defenses against all manner of illness."
82,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_037","When I heard this, I knew that as much as I wanted to deliver a gift to Nidhana, there was another in far greater need."
83,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_038","I speak of the child we rescued during the Final Days. Vaazti, daughter of Qerasaf and Mehvan."
84,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_039","Long had I wanted to gift the child one of my catches, but young stomachs are sensitive. This, however, is exactly what she needs."
85,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_040","Without you watching over me, I would never have been able to venture so deep into the island's heart."
86,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_041","So allow me to thank you once again for answering our plea, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! "
87,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_MATSYA_000_042","And now I must deliver Vaazti's meal. I've made a dish fit for a child's delicate constitution, and I'd best hurry before it gets cold."
88,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_043","Of course, I owe you my thanks as well, but I will save them until after the child has been fed. We shall speak again in Yedlihmad."
89,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_045","There you are, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! "
90,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_046","You will be pleased to know that Vaazti quite enjoyed Master Matsya's dish. I can think of no better note on which to end the day!"
91,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_100_046","Ahem. On behalf of all peoples of Aloalo, past, present, and future, I commend your bravery! The island's fortunes are bright, and Master Matsya is in high spirits!"
92,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_047","No matter the era or the culture, I believe it is customary to give gifts to those to whom you are indebted. Rest assured I do not intend to shirk this custom!"
93,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_000_048","There were more than enough fish left over to prepare another fine meal. And so, with Pasasun to handle the more laborious tasks, together we did just that."
94,"TEXT_AKTKVA310_04790_KALIKA_100_048","'Tis a local favorite quite similar to a traditional delicacy of Aloalo. May it give you a new appreciation for the island cultures of these fair seas. From our homes to your lips!"
