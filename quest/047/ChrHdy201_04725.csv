※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_CHRHDY201_04725_SEQ_01","Godbert is ready to proceed with the refinement of his family's weaponry, and to that end, the goldsmith informs you that yet another type of meteoritic material is needed to enhance your armament's aetherial conductivity. According to his ancestor's manual, however, the true key to the process is something rather more intangible: a clarity achieved in the aftermath of an invigorating victory. Godbert claims to have already gained such battle-based enlightenment through his encounter with Doctor Lugae, and insists that Gerolt undergo his own form of martial meditation. You are to accompany the blacksmith to Windweft, where Godbert has prepared for him the perfect opponent.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDY201_04725_SEQ_02","Godbert introduces you to Gerolt's opponent: an adorable axe-wielding mammet. Despite his obvious advantage in size and strength, Gerolt loses the initial bout, but a generous application of Salamanderville empowers him to overcome the surprisingly agile automaton. Fired up by his win, the blacksmith can hardly wait to stoke the flames of his furnace. It seems you had best acquire the necessary materials swiftly, before the glow of victory fades...

※Chunks of complementary chondrite can be obtained from Jubrunnah at the aetheryte plaza in Radz–at–Han."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDY201_04725_SEQ_03","You deliver the chunks of chondrite to Gerolt, and the world seems to grow dark as you anxiously await the outcome. When the hammering stops, however, you find yourself in possession of a successfully augmented Manderville masterpiece. Gerolt then inquires as to how long the entire refinement process is likely to take─a question to which Godbert has no present answer. In breaking the cipher, Godbert has realized that the manual is but the first part of an incomplete set, and that locating the remainder of Godbrand's instructions will be a quest unto itself. Until the continuation of the guide is found, you must content yourself with your as-yet-imperfect weaponry."
