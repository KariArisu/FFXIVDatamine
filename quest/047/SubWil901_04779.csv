Nananji appears to be in deep thought."
1,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_SEQ_01","Making your way through Ul'dah, you encounter a budding writer named Nananji Nononji, who tells you that he seeks to write a biography of the late Archon Louisoix. To that end, he has arranged to interview a member of the Immortal Flames, and asks that you accompany him as an assistant. Upon agreeing to his request, you are directed to join him at Camp Drybone ahead of the interview.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_SEQ_02","After arriving at Camp Drybone, Nananji leads you to a nearby graveyard, where he explains his motivation for writing the biography. The Calamity had destroyed his village and killed his parents, and he struggles to move forward in a world where ever fewer people spare the event any thought. In learning about Louisoix and his part in Eorzea's salvation, it is his hope that he will attain closure, and having reviewed what is widely known of the subject, you set off for the interview at Highbridge."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_SEQ_03","The interviewee, Flame Lieutenant Hollin Aubrey, arrives shortly after you do, and he proceeds to give an account of his dealings with Louisoix. Thanks to the Archon, the forces of Eorzea were made aware of the Meteor project, which Legatus Nael van Darnus sought to utilize to purge all life from the realm. At this juncture in his tale, the lieutenant offers to introduce you to someone who is better suited to recount what follows, and Nananji happily accepts. Thus is it decided that you will next take yourselves to Apkallu Falls in Gridania for another interview."
4,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_SEQ_04","As you wait in the tranquil surrounds of Apkallu Falls, your interviewee appears in the form of Serpent Lieutenant Syro Fulke. The lieutenant speaks of how Louisoix had secured external support for the Order of the Twin Adder as it sought to vanquish the rampaging Garuda. And when it subsequently came to light that the VIIth Imperial Legion had constructed a lunar transmitter─the device that would pluck Dalamud from the heavens─within their new castrum, the three nations responded by reforming the Eorzean Alliance, and appointed the Archon their tactician. For that which comes after, the operation to destroy the lunar transmitter, the lieutenant directs you to a soldier who actually took part in it. To that end do you make your way to Maelstrom Command in Limsa Lominsa, where the individual may be found."
5,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_SEQ_05","Entering Maelstrom Command, you are warmly greeted by Storm Commander R'ashaht Rhiki. The commander takes you through the details of the operation, which saw the main force of the Alliance lay siege to the castrum while an elite band of adventurers destroyed the lunar transmitter. Although the operation failed to halt Dalamud's descent, it served to demonstrate to the people of Eorzea that, by standing together, they could oppose even the might of the Empire. And at Louisoix's behest, they stood together once more at the Carteneau Flats, where they fought desperately to secure the area for the ritual to cast the red moon back unto the heavens. To the shock of all present, however, Bahamut burst forth from Dalamud and proceeded to unleash his fury upon the realm. While it is held that Louisoix had defeated the dread being, all memories of the Calamity were shrouded in haze, and no one remembers what actually happened. Curious as to events prior to that moment, Nananji asks R'ashaht if someone was near Louisoix during the battle, but she regrettably does not know. There the tale ends, and you thank the commander before taking your leave."
6,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_SEQ_06","While Nananji has learned a great deal about Louisoix, there is still more that he wishes to know. If you are willing, he asks that you accompany him for a little longer."

76,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_027","Now then, in preparation for the interview, let's review what is known about our subject."
77,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_028","It's difficult to define exactly when the Seventh Umbral Calamity was set in motion. Many historians, however, point to the Empire's Meteor project, which sought to bring Dalamud down upon Eorzea."
78,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_029","It was the year 1562 of the Sixth Astral Era. Seeking to combat the imperial threat, Louisoix founded the Circle of Knowing, an order whose objective was the preservation of Eorzea."
79,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_030","Through its members, the Archons of Sharlayan, the Circle worked to unite the nations of Eorzea in common cause."
80,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_031","The result was the formation of the Grand Companies in the three city-states. The Immortal Flames, the Order of the Twin Adder, and the Maelstrom─none of these would exist now were it not for their efforts. "
81,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_032","And then in the year 1572, when the situation was coming to a head, Louisoix himself made the journey to Eorzea in secret and engaged with each of the nations. What took place during that time is what I seek to learn in the interview."
82,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_033","The man we're due to meet is the contact for the Free Brigade, a unit formed of adventurers, and he apparently had Louisoix's assistance for a mission."
83,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_034","The meeting place is Highbridge, to the northeast. It's more or less time now, so let's make our way there."

90,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_046","My understanding is you had dealings with Louisoix. Could you please tell me the details? "
91,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_047","As you know, our Grand Companies were formed thanks to the Circle of Knowing. But it wasn't until Dalamud began turning red that Louisoix first appeared."
92,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_049","It began with the word that an elderly Elezen man had come to Gridania who held the key to vanquishing primals. Upon learning of this, I sent an adventurer of the Free Brigade to make contact with him."
93,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_050","I later learned that the Maelstrom and the Order of the Twin Adder had done the very same. At that time, our companies weren't yet collaborating; each one only thought to stay ahead of the others."
94,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_051","If truth be told, at first we didn't think much of Louisoix─only that he was the leader of scholars who studied peculiar prophecies. But when the adventurer reported back, our opinion of the man completely changed."
95,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_052","With his spellcraft, Louisoix had opened the way into Ifrit's domain. And by the hand of dauntless adventurers, the Lord of the Inferno was brought low."
96,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_053","Alas, many defeats preceded that victory. It was reported that countless charred corpses laid strewn in the Bowl of Embers."
97,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_054","Now, the mission also yielded a shocking revelation."
98,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_055","Following the battle, Legatus Nael van Darnus of the VIIth Imperial Legion appeared and told the adventurer that the hour of reckoning was at hand. That Dalamud would soon fall and cleanse the land."
99,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_056","That was when we realized that the Empire was behind the red moon's anomaly."
100,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_NANANJI_000_057","So thanks to Louisoix, you came to be aware of the Meteor project. Still, it doesn't seem like you had much to act upon."
101,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_059","As you say. Afterwards, we scrambled to learn all we could about the project."
102,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_060","For a blessing, we had the cooperation of a Garlean defector: Cid Garlond, whom you know well."
103,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_061","He revealed the details of the project─that it utilized a transmission tower to pluck Dalamud from the heavens, all for the purpose of purging us savages from the realm."

109,"TEXT_SUBWIL901_04779_AUBREY_000_067","Do not mention it. As I said, I hold Louisoix in the highest esteem. He was the one who brought our three nations together, and nothing would please me more than for him to be remembered."
