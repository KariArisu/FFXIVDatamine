1,"TEXT_AKTKUA205_04794_SEQ_01","The curious courier informs you that Tataru's final group of guests will soon make landfall. You follow the familiar path down to the western inlet and wonder who will arrive."
2,"TEXT_AKTKUA205_04794_SEQ_02","Tataru is joined by none other than Jullus and a group of fellow Ist Legion soldiers, nigh unrecognizable in their civilian attire. She explains that Emmanellain and Sicard were adamant they travel to your island for a reprieve from the grueling efforts of rebuilding their homeland. Yet, despite finding themselves in a veritable paradise, Jullus and his comrades seem uncertain how best to proceed. Suspecting that typical vacation activities may feel less intuitive to your friends from the frozen north, Tataru breaks the ice by suggesting cooperation with the island's industrious mammets instead. The Garleans eagerly offer up their willing hands and agricultural expertise, and you all head off towards the hideaway."
3,"TEXT_AKTKUA205_04794_SEQ_03","Your guests have dispersed, but Tataru realizes she forgot to distribute a most important gift: garments fit for tropical climes. Determined to see them delivered, she asks that you take her handpicked outfits to Jullus, his taciturn friend, and the Garlean who expressed an interest in logging."

5,"TEXT_AKTKUA205_04794_SEQ_05","Night falls, and you sit before a blazing bonfire with your guests, singing and drinking in a rare evening of revelry. Jullus gazes at the dancing flames, deep in thought. He recalls to you the events that led to this moment, from the civil war which fueled Anima's summoning to the unlikely friendships forged with the twins, Varshahn, and Zero. An endless string of endings, he muses, as inexorable as time itself. Yet in loss comes gain, and from yesterday comes the hope of tomorrow..."
6,"TEXT_AKTKUA205_04794_SEQ_06","The Garleans thank you for hosting them, their faces glowing and refreshed. Eager to repay your generosity, Jullus promises to extend his own invitation to you once their nation has better recovered, and your guests excuse themselves to the skiff. Before she joins them, Tataru confides that she has relished the time spent on your isle alongside so many comrades from around the star. With no further plans to intrude with visitors, she bids you enjoy your idyllic island life to the fullest."
