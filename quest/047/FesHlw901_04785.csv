※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW901_04785_SEQ_01","While the saints of Eorzea sleep off their night of revelry, the wicked come out to play. All Saints' Wake is once again come to Gridania, and the Adventurers' Guild has sent a lone investigator to ensure that ghastly ghouls do not overrun the city as in ages past. While all appears civil for now, the investigator is certain that the pumpkin-headed apparition is brewing a devious plot and recruits you to approach her under the guise of cooperation. After winning her confidence, you are to put an end to any schemes you uncover.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW901_04785_SEQ_02","Your stint as an undercover mischief-maker is cut short when the pumpkin-headed apparition reveals that she knows the investigator is investigating her. She seems unperturbed, however, and assures you that she works to make this year's festivities thrilling, but not horrifying. To this end, she asks you to aid Papa Gruff, a voidsent-turned-clown who is apparently having trouble providing the townspeople with merry thrills. He can be found near the Leatherworkers' Guild─that is, if an angry mob has yet to chase him off."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW901_04785_SEQ_03","You come across Papa Gruff just as he is about to start his show. Joining the audience of one, you observe as he turns a common pumpkin into the supposed embodiment of terror: a small puppy that brings a hearty laugh to the Wood Wailer in attendance. Nonplussed by this reaction, Papa Gruff is eager to receive your help in understanding the subtleties of fright, and already seems to have an idea on how you can teach him."
4,"TEXT_FESHLW901_04785_SEQ_04","Papa Gruff asks you to accompany him on a tour of the All Saints' Wake festivities near both the Leatherworkers' Guild and Lancers' Guild, during which you will instruct him on what form the decorative pumpkins should take. Your guiding words are “Frighten enough to tickle, but not scar.”

※You must be accompanied by Papa Gruff to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
5,"TEXT_FESHLW901_04785_SEQ_05","With your guidance, Papa Gruff transforms pumpkins throughout Gridania into creatures that evoke dread and delight in equal measure, with not one person fleeing in terror or laughing in mockery. Papa Gruff wishes to test his understanding of these lessons, and so asks you to accompany him to another pumpkin display near Apkallu Falls."
6,"TEXT_FESHLW901_04785_SEQ_06","Voluntarily exercising restraint for possibly the first time in his life, Papa Gruff performs an All Saints' Wake illusion that entertains without a single tear shed. Emboldened by this success, he decides to try again, and instructs you to accompany him to another display of pumpkins by the Whistling Miller."
7,"TEXT_FESHLW901_04785_SEQ_07","A frightened young woman is trembling by the pumpkin display when you arrive, insisting that she was accosted by what seemed to be a horrible monster while she was tilling the fields at the Greatloam Growery. Knowing that Papa Gruff's creations can't move far on their own, you fear that actual voidsent may be lurking within Gridania. Your only course of action is to make haste to the Growery and hope that what the botanist saw in those fields has yet to leave for more populated areas."
8,"TEXT_FESHLW901_04785_SEQ_08","The voidsent in question is eager to show itself and seems to be intent upon reviving the ancient traditions of the Night of Devilry, when monsters once roamed free and people cowered in fear. Papa Gruff, however, flatly refuses to participate in this lesser voidsent's plot, citing the wisdom he has gained as a master of both mischief and mirth. Apparently drawn by the scent of half-baked schemes, the pumpkin-headed apparition appears and summarily turns the rogue voidsent into a sad little gourd. She chuckles fondly at Papa Gruff's newfound maturity, but acknowledges that it is yet too early to celebrate, as other fiends still prowl Gridania to foment chaos among its populace..."
9,"TEXT_FESHLW901_04785_SEQ_09","The pumpkin-headed woman bestows upon you a wand, which she says will enable you to turn voidsent into pumpkins with a single motion.
