1,"TEXT_AKTKEA301_04791_SEQ_01","Outside Revenant's Toll, Deryk informs you that Krile and G'raha Tia are still busy compiling the findings of your investigation of the phantom realm. While awaiting developments, he suggests paying a visit to Snoegeim in the Omphalos, and together you set off."
2,"TEXT_AKTKEA301_04791_SEQ_02","Snoegeim reveals that, while the Twelve have not appeared since your crew was last gathered, each of them apparently desires to speak with you in private; if you were to call to them before the entrances to their respective heavens, chances are they will answer. Not wanting to miss the opportunity, you begin taking yourself around the Omphalos."
3,"TEXT_AKTKEA301_04791_SEQ_03","Having spoken with the Twelve to your satisfaction, you join the wait for Krile and G'raha Tia. When they eventually arrive, they share their finding that the deities expended a tremendous amount of aether in the course of battle. Before engaging them further, it is decided that you will seek out the watcher on the moon, who is believed to be the thirteenth unnamed being mentioned by the monument, in order to learn more about their objective. With your course decided, you promptly set off for the Watcher's Palace in Mare Lamentorum."
4,"TEXT_AKTKEA301_04791_SEQ_04","Having confirmed that he is indeed the unnamed being, the watcher proceeds to explain the nature of the Twelve. Like him, they are entities created by Hydaelyn, charged with watching over the world after reality was sundered. And though he is unable to disclose the truth of their desire, he gives his guarantee that it will not visit harm upon mankind. Thus reassured, you and your companions decide to return to the Omphalos to continue engaging the gods."
5,"TEXT_AKTKEA301_04791_SEQ_05","No sooner do you arrive in the Omphalos than Llymlaen and Thaliak appear before you. When G'raha Tia expresses to them his concern that doing battle dilutes their being, it is Deryk who answers─thereby revealing himself to be Oschon. The Wanderer promises that the truth will be revealed in the innermost part of their realm, before he and his brethren take their leave in anticipation of your coming."
6,"TEXT_AKTKEA301_04791_SEQ_06","While saddened by the revelation of Deryk's true identity, you and your companions are determined to do the best you can by the Twelve. As before, the task of confronting the gods in their sanctums falls to you, and you turn to see to your preparations.

※Thaleia can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
7,"TEXT_AKTKEA301_04791_SEQ_07","Fighting your way through breathtaking realms of water and wind, you strike down the three gods in succession before coming face-to-face with the Twelve's combined form. This mighty being, too, must fall by your hand if you are to grant the gods their hearts' desire."
8,"TEXT_AKTKEA301_04791_SEQ_08","At the end of a furious struggle, you succeed in overcoming your foe, and are joined by your companions just as the Twelve reveal the true nature of their desire: to give themselves unto the star as a blessing. While this means they must fade from existence, their stabilizing influence shall endure in the form of the instrument of blessing, a great contraption which they created to receive of mortal hopes in their stead. So it is that, one by one, the gods bid you farewell and disappear amidst blinding light─all except for Oschon who reappears before you as Deryk."
9,"TEXT_AKTKEA301_04791_SEQ_09","Like everyone, Krile is surprised that Deryk is standing there. While she is curious as to what happened, above all else, she is overjoyed for a friend returned."
