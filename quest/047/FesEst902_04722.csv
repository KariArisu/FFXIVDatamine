0,"TEXT_FESEST902_04722_SEQ_00","Hamlyn is quivering in his excitement.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST902_04722_SEQ_01","It turns out that Hamlyn's master plan to restore peace to the plundered caravan is strikingly similar─if not utterly identical─to the plan you carried out not moments ago. If it will solve your sylph dilemma long enough to get your hands on some glorious eggs, however, you're willing to give it the old Archon try. You head to the Central Shroud and prepare to combat the sylphs' green mood with some green of your own.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.
※The FATE “Don't Be Sylphish” can only be completed as a Disciple of War or Magic."
2,"TEXT_FESEST902_04722_SEQ_02","After a frantic scuffle involving sylphs, a giant mammet, and more tonberries than is comfortable to have in one location, you manage to recover the scattered Archon eggs. Panting from exertion and pleased to be free of your sweaty guise (once more pawed off you by an overzealous Hamlyn), you trek back to Gridania to give Jihli the good news."
3,"TEXT_FESEST902_04722_SEQ_03","Hamlyn is singing your praises─or, more accurately, the noble tonberry's praises─with phlegmy excitement when you arrive, lamenting only the absence of large crowds who might have witnessed the miraculous feats performed by his adorable idols. As it turns out, enough townsfolk were present to warrant extending personal thanks for returning their precious eggs─which they ought to decorate <Emphasis>as</Emphasis> tonberries to prevent any further sylph shenanigans, Hamlyn helpfully suggests. While Hamlyn could not be less subtle in his tonberry touting, you can't deny the modicum of truth in his suggestion, and really, you'd just like to get on with it already. Jihli smiles and officially proclaims the start of Hatching–tide─let the eggy, eggy, stabby fun begin!"

51,"TEXT_FESEST902_04722_HAMLYN_000_004","...Ahem, it may seem like a rather familiar tactic, but terror is not so easily overcome.

82,"TEXT_FESEST902_04722_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_037","Of course, all our eggs are packaged during transit, meaning the sylphs will likely continue their mischief until we can unwrap them safely.
