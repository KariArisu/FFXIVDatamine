1,"TEXT_AKTKRA304_04759_SEQ_01","It seems that Lahabrea has conjured a plan to free Claudien, though he is less than forthcoming with the details. For the time being, he tasks you with standing against his former lover, that she may be weak enough for his scheme to succeed. And so you steel your spirits for one final excursion into Athena's gate.

※Anabaseios: The Twelfth Circle can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA304_04759_SEQ_02","As befits one who has laid many a god low and lived to tell of it, you remain unshaken by Athena's attempts to plunge you into the abyss. Despite her power to warp nature itself, you emerge triumphant and ready to see her evil experiments ended for good."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA304_04759_SEQ_03","Although defeated, Athena yet lives. She is more than happy to reveal that her grand design was to replace life upon Etheirys with superior beings of her creation, and confirms that Erichthonios was never more than a tool for this end. Her ambitions now denied, she attempts to purge the aetherial sea with a burst of powerful magicks, but is stymied by the sudden awakening of Claudien's will, roused from its slumber by Erichthonios's memories. Her control over the body lost, Athena's memories are expelled, leaving her a powerless phantom. As the space that was once Pandæmonium begins to collapse as the forces holding it together vanish, Themis teleports you and Lahabrea to safety, leaving no witness to Athena's final moments."
4,"TEXT_AKTKRA304_04759_SEQ_04","While the loss of Erichthonios lies heavy in the hearts of all present, you rest assured that his sacrifice was not in vain. Peace is restored to the aetherial sea, but Claudien remains insensate. Themis says that he will stand vigil over the professor, and instructs you to rest until such time as you are needed."
