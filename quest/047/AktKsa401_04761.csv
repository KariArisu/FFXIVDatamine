Curious yourself as to the present state of affairs in the region, you agree to meet with Gaius in Terncliff and present him with a set of the boutique's finest samples.

※You may travel to Terncliff by speaking with the Resistance escort in Porta Praetoria."
2,"TEXT_AKTKSA401_04761_SEQ_02","You are barely able to introduce the samples to Gaius before he informs you of a more pressing matter─the G-Savior Mark II has been stolen, and by none other than Valens van Varro returned from the dead, according to Avilina. You agree to lend your aid in retrieving the vessel and apprehending the villain."

4,"TEXT_AKTKSA401_04761_SEQ_04","No sooner is the operation underway than a conundrum presents itself: to safely apprehend the G-Savior Mark II, you must either risk destroying the vessel from afar, making it impossible to identify the culprit, or draw near and lose the element of surprise. It is at this most timely of times that Nero tol Scaeva, engineer extraordinaire and former tribunus of the XIVth Legion, interrupts your transmission to present a solution to the problem─the aptly named Anti-G missiles. After launching a barrage of the projectiles, you send the Mark II crashing to the most unlikely of locations─the very spot where Valens was thought to have met his end at the crushing hand of the Diamond Weapon. A belief you quickly discover to be true, as it is revealed that the man bearing Valens's likeness is none other than a former pilus of the now defunct VIIth Legion─a zealot named Procopius, who altered his face to act as the deceased legatus's double. Incapacitating the man to be rid of his wild ravings, Gaius declares the mission complete, and bids you return to Terncliff."
