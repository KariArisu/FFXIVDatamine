※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESANV902_04766_SEQ_01","While Nhagi'a ponders matters, Kipih asks that you watch over him, and the wandering minstrel adds his voice to her request. Thus do you set off after the young adventurer, who went in the direction of the Sapphire Avenue Exchange.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESANV902_04766_SEQ_02","You find Nhagi'a in the midst of rumination. He explains to you that he was a burden to Kipih in the past, and he doesn't wish to be a burden again. That is his motivation for wanting to become a capable adventurer who doesn't need to depend on others, and he struggles to see why that is wrong. In his search for an answer, he decides to consult Momodi, and makes his way to the Quicksand."
3,"TEXT_FESANV902_04766_SEQ_03","The chat with Momodi works wonders, and Nhagi'a comes to the realization that, at some point, his desire to prove himself to his sister had displaced his own motive for being an adventurer. Back outside the Quicksand, you turn to Nhagi'a to see what he intends to do next."
4,"TEXT_FESANV902_04766_SEQ_04","Nhagi'a tells you that he now has an answer for Kipih, and when they speak, he wants to show her one of the letters he collected. To that end, he asks you to help him find the letter in the Gold Court, and together you go to rejoin the wandering minstrel."
5,"TEXT_FESANV902_04766_SEQ_05","The wandering minstrel is happy for Nhagi'a to borrow the letter in question. The three of you then proceed to search for the missive, which is identifiable by the drawing of a blue chocobo that adorns it."
6,"TEXT_FESANV902_04766_SEQ_06","A brief search yields what appears to be the letter you seek, and you take it over to Nhagi'a."
7,"TEXT_FESANV902_04766_SEQ_07","Nhagi'a confirms that this is indeed the letter he wishes to show to Kipih, and he promptly heads over to the Weavers' Guild, where she had indicated that she had business. Wishing to know how events unfold, the wandering minstrel bids you accompany the young adventurer for his meeting with his sister."
8,"TEXT_FESANV902_04766_SEQ_08","At the Weavers' Guild, you watch on as the siblings bare their hearts to one another. Nhagi'a declares that he will no longer obsess over doing everything alone, having remembered why he became an adventurer in the first place. Relieved, Kipih takes the opportunity to remind him of how, as a young boy, he had told her that he wanted to simply be a free-spirited adventurer who traveled the world and lent a helping hand to those in need. Saddened to see that boy lose his way, Kipih had spoken sternly, but it was never her intent to deny him his calling, and she wholeheartedly supports him now as he continues on his path. Thus does the tale come to a happy conclusion, and you bid the two a fond farewell as they return to walking their respective paths."
9,"TEXT_FESANV902_04766_SEQ_09","You report back to the wandering minstrel, who expresses his gladness for the siblings. Inspired by these events, he conceives of a verse and proceeds to perform it. Even as the first chord resounds in your ear, you find yourself hurtling through unknown skies aboard an airship, where you meet with the mysterious Naoki Yoshida. The man thanks you for your enduring support, and shares his excitement for what yet lies ahead, before sending you back to reality. After you return to yourself on the streets of Ul'dah, the minstrel performs for you another song─one imbued with the hope that you will never forget whence you came, for therein lies the strength to forge on in the face of adversity."
