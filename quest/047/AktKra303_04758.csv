1,"TEXT_AKTKRA303_04758_SEQ_01","Given what you know so far, Lahabrea suggests that recent events likely began with Professor Claudien being lured to Azys Lla by the Heart of Sabik's aetherial signature, which led to Athena's awakening. Much remains unclear, however, and the only path to answers lies through Pandæmonium's final gate─and through Themis. While you do not relish facing your quondam ally in battle, you hold on to the hope that Athena's spell can be broken, and make ready to set forth to wherever he awaits.

※Anabaseios: The Eleventh Circle can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA303_04758_SEQ_02","Themis proves to be an adversary worthy of his station, but you emerge victorious against the emissary. Although he is injured, his aether remains stable─for how long, however, is uncertain."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA303_04758_SEQ_03","By reinforcing Themis's dissipating aether with your own, you manage to grant him extra time in your own age. He is grateful for your efforts, and vows to judge Athena's actions as his position demands. You return to the entrance of Pandæmonium, where Erichthonios and Lahabrea stand eager to hear what the now-freed emissary has to say."
4,"TEXT_AKTKRA303_04758_SEQ_04","Themis reveals that Athena's vessel, which will become her next stepping stone toward godhood, is none other than Professor Claudien. Although this ought to be impossible, Themis's time as Athena's puppet provided useful insight in how it works, as he observed her calling Claudien by a familiar name─Erichthonios. This revelation is a shock to all present, save Lahabrea, whose cryptic statement suggests he saw it coming for some time."
