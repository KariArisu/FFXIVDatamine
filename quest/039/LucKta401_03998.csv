1,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_01","Konogg, still inconsolable following the disappearance of his sister Anogg, explains that little has changed in Komra since last you spoke. This indeed seems to be the case, as several of the same villagers who previously spoke out against the twins soon arrive to further express their disgruntlement. Among them is a man you have not seen before, who hastens to chastise Konogg for his culpability in the tragedy that led to his wife's severe injury. Your dwarven friend is visibly shaken, and dissolves into tears on the spot."
2,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_02","With some effort and a few gentle pats on the back, you succeed in raising Konogg's spirits somewhat. He is determined to find a way to help the man and his wife, but fears that he will have little luck determining what might improve their situation while the other villagers are so ill-disposed toward civil conversation with him. Naturally, you volunteer to make inquiries in his stead."
3,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_03","You speak with two of the dwarves you saw previously, rightly guessing that they would have some idea of what might be of comfort to the injured parties. The answer─perhaps predictably─is alcohol, with mead being the beverage of choice."
4,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_04","Konogg is happy enough to seize upon the idea of a gift of mead for lack of any better ones, though the two of you soon realize that, with the village's liquor stores having gone up in flames, you will need to travel to Stilltide to purchase it. His sense of duty guides Konogg to insist on making the journey himself─with you as a guide, of course."
5,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_05","You meet Konogg outside of Komra to explain the route you will be taking to Stilltide. Despite the unfortunate circumstances surrounding it─or perhaps because of them─he seems eager to make the trip."
6,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_06","Konogg halts at the top of the Ladder to take in the sights. If they do not provide the enlightenment he seeks, perhaps you can."
7,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_07","At Konogg's insistence, you regale him with the tale of how you and the people of Norvrandt restored the massive device to functionality. It is unclear whether he is more inspired or intimidated by this, but in any case, he presses on."
8,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_08","Fortunately, you have not provided Konogg with detailed information on the location of the Leaky Keel, so he cannot dash away the moment you alight from the Ladder. Once you confirm the direction of your destination; however, he is filled with vigor at the prospect of nearing his goal, and does just that."
9,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_09","You find Konogg mentally fortifying himself outside the Leaky Keel. Whether he is intimidated at the prospect of entering an establishment so far from his village or simply trying to remember how to make a polite request after so long bossing an indulgent adventurer around is anyone's guess. Fortunately, he has no cause to worry, as Theva is charmed by his earnestness and kindly brings him a bottle of her finest mead."
10,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_10","Mead in hand, Konogg takes the lead back to the village. Unable to know what kind of reception the gift will earn, you elect to take him up on his offer to join him as he delivers it."
11,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_11","Konogg attempts to deliver the mead along with heartfelt sentiments, but the injured woman's husband will have none of it. His hopes of helping in some small way thoroughly dashed, Konogg flees, more distressed than ever."
12,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_12","As you attempt to chase down Konogg, you come upon a discarded bottle of mead─and then the dig site chief, who tells you that he but moments ago saw Konogg fleeing toward the crater. He asks that you continue your pursuit with haste, as the dwarf is in no state to be wandering around such a dangerous location."
13,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_13","Though you travel a fair distance into the Puppets' Bunker, you see no sign of Konogg. He must have been running as fast as his tiny legs could carry him."
14,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_14","You proceed to the command room, but still have yet to find Konogg─a worrying state of affairs indeed."
15,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_15","Deep within the alien ship, you at last locate Konogg...communing with a mysterious orb. The Echo provides some insight into the situation, though perhaps not as much as one would like: Anogg was caught in a rockslide and tumbled to the bottom of a cliff, only for her─or something identical─to appear before Konogg when he happened upon the strange white orb you now see. This raises a variety of vital questions, but as Konogg's safety is paramount, you convince him to return to the village for the time being."
16,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_16","Konogg insists that he is fine, despite being quite clearly anything but. It appears unlikely that you will get much else out of him."
17,"TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_17","You report what you have seen to the dig site chief, who assures you─and himself─that Anogg is surely alive and well, and will like as not return soon enough. He asks that you keep mum on the subject of the orb until Konogg has had time to recover, that there be no further cause for panic among the villagers."
