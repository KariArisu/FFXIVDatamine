0,"TEXT_LUCKHT023_03984_SEQ_00","Joellie has a minor matter of public safety to attend to before joining Neillemard and the others at the manufactory.
※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_LUCKHT023_03984_SEQ_01","You inquire with Joellie as to whether she and Emeny are ready to join their fellow engineers at the manufactory. As Spanner must first be stored in a secure location for the bodily safety of passersby, however, they send you on ahead.

※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHT023_03984_SEQ_02","As you wait with Neillemard and Nimie, Stephanivien himself once again makes an appearance, this time accompanied by the ever-enterprising Rowena. Both admire your skybuilders' tool, and the proprietress of the House of Splendors wastes not a moment in demanding yet more replica materials from the beleaguered son of House Haillenarte."
3,"TEXT_LUCKHT023_03984_SEQ_03","You are at long last joined by Joellie and Emeny, accompanied by Stephanivien's younger brother Francel, the Firmament overseer, who professes both a personal and professional interest in the Skysteel tools project. Appreciation is shared freely, as Francel thanks the engineers for their contributions to Ishgard's reconstruction and they, in turn, thank you for the vital role you played in bringing their designs to life. Whether your paths will again cross remains to be seen, but one thing is certain─you are bound for greater heights."
