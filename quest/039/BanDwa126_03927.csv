53,"TEXT_BANDWA126_03927_SHIGITT_000_030","What I need from you is a replacement casing for protecting the automaton's main joints. We can't have it rolling through the dirt and the mud with all its...uh...“bits” exposed."
54,"TEXT_BANDWA126_03927_SHIGITT_000_040","What I need from you is a fresh batch of oil for the automaton's reserves. It's running low after leaking from several, um, “unplanned” perforations, and the supply's been contaminated with debris in any case..."

65,"TEXT_BANDWA126_03927_DWARFA03927_000_082","I know it's an odd place to make repairs, but we were worried about secondary explosions. Wouldn't do to have sparks flying near the Anvil's fuel barrels now, would it? Ahem, you should probably be on your way. Try not to stomp, eh?"
