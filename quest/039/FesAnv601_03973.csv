※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESANV601_03973_SEQ_01","The Rising festival is known for bringing a splash of color to Ul'dah each year. On this occasion, a work of fine art in stained glass serves as the focal point, and its creator, J'bhen Tia is on hand to explain his inspiration. He has chosen to depict one of the pivotal moments in Ul'dahn history prior to the Calamity in which Nanamo Ul Namo addressed the rioting masses, imploring them to put aside their grievances and instead cooperate for the greater good. To accompany the artwork, a wandering minstrel of great renown is due to give a recital to commemorate the event, and J'bhen Tia would like you to help distribute flyers to drum up as large a crowd as possible.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESANV601_03973_SEQ_02","In the process of publicizing the Rising's special attractions, you meet several members of the Ul'dahn citizenry. While they come from various walks of life, they are all keen to savor the delights on offer, and agree to attend. You then make for the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, where you have arranged to meet J'bhen Tia."
3,"TEXT_FESANV601_03973_SEQ_03","You spot J'bhen Tia in the midst of the bustling market, though it appears that trouble is brewing. His friend Astin, a moneylender, is engaged in a heated argument with a local merchant, and it falls to J'bhen Tia to diffuse the situation. The artist explains that disputes such as these are precisely the reason why he chose the subject matter for his stained glass art, with Astin a prime example of one whose compassionate side is overshadowed by his obsession with turning a profit. The two of you agree to meet back at the Ruby Road Exchange to prepare to receive the attendees at the Rising celebrations."
4,"TEXT_FESANV601_03973_SEQ_04","Upon your return, you find J'bhen Tia decidedly crestfallen as a group of children look on sheepishly. Your new acquaintance is struggling to find the words to explain precisely what has happened, but it is clear he would benefit from your moral support."
