※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESANV602_03974_SEQ_01","In J'bhen Tia's absence, the stained glass that he had so painstakingly created has been accidentally shattered by a group of children who got a little too close to the exhibit. With the opening of the Rising festivities fast approaching, the only viable option is to piece together the artwork as best you can before the spectators arrive.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESANV602_03974_SEQ_02","With your gift for solving puzzles, the stained glass art is restored to more or less its original state. Once J'bhen Tia has glued the reassembled shards into the frame, his work will be ready to be put on display once more."
3,"TEXT_FESANV602_03974_SEQ_03","J'bhen Tia is ecstatic that the exhibition is able to go ahead despite the catastrophe that had befallen his artwork. With the event due to start, he asks if you might persuade his childhood friend Astin to attend. Their relationship has been somewhat troubled of late, and J'Bhen feels that the invitation would be better received if delivered by a third party, namely, you."
4,"TEXT_FESANV602_03974_SEQ_04","It soon becomes apparent that Astin was fully aware of the exhibition, but he had decided not to attend. Since he is an infamous moneylender, he was concerned that J'bhen Tia's reputation would suffer if their association became public knowledge. Nonetheless, he is prepared to consider the invitation, though it is still unclear whether he will actually make an appearance."
5,"TEXT_FESANV602_03974_SEQ_05","The art exhibition and accompanying song courtesy of the wandering minstrel are met with resounding applause, and many in the crowd were deeply moved by the message of goodwill towards one's fellow man. Astin, who had made up his mind to attend after all, found the tale of the Sultana's Seven particularly relevant to his current situation. He chooses to give up the life of a moneylender in order to return to working as an art dealer, and he offers to find buyers for J'bhen Tia's stained glass. The young virtuoso is overjoyed that Astin has turned over a new leaf and offers you his heartfelt thanks in not only rescuing the exhibition, but also their friendship. He then mentions that the wandering minstrel is looking for you, though you will need to speak with him yourself to find out why."
6,"TEXT_FESANV602_03974_SEQ_06","The wandering minstrel expresses his appreciation for your part in this year's Rising festival, and offers a song by way of reward. You are then swept away on the waves of a divine melody to another realm entirely, free from the bounds of time and space. You are met by the enigmatic Naoki Yoshida and his Lalafellin companions, who appear to have been expecting you. Though his words are somewhat cryptic, his sincerity is unmistakable. You are eventually returned to the present day, whereupon the minstrel welcomes you back from your waking dream. He performs one last song, while the fireworks above fill the night sky."
