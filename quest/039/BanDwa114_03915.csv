49,"TEXT_BANDWA114_03915_REGITT_000_002","Of course, we've already got one, but that didn't stop him from making his own that produces ethanol spirits for drinking. Upon hearing the news, I was inspired to open a tavern in the Anvil, to give Lakelanders libations the likes of which few have tasted, while also making our coinpurses heavy with profit."
50,"TEXT_BANDWA114_03915_REGITT_000_003","We've been brewing our unique brand of booze and using the gil we've earned to help fund work on the Rolling Tankards.

Besides, a full treasury would surely suit our purposes better than an empty one, wouldn't you say?"
51,"TEXT_BANDWA114_03915_REGITT_000_004","Of course you agree! That's why I've chosen none other than you to aid Girutt in improving our budding tavern! Go speak with him─I believe you'll find him most amenable."

If you're not as good as they say, Ronitt's automaton is here with whatever you need."
