1,"TEXT_BANDWA006_03901_SEQ_01","Following the roaring success of the Rolling Tankards, Ronitt is planning to host a small gathering of those who have contributed to Watts's Anvil. Rather than asking you to visit the far reaches of Norvrandt, extending personal invitations to each guest one by one, he saves you the trouble by volunteering to do the legwork himself, and asks only that you wait for him in Clearmelt with Lorathia.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANDWA006_03901_SEQ_02","The guests arrive and are plied with Norvrandt's finest cuisine, while those partial to ale drink far more than is sensible. Regitt and Karutt offer some slurred words of gratitude and say their farewells before they can sully the clear waters of Clearmelt with the contents of their stomachs."
3,"TEXT_BANDWA006_03901_SEQ_03","Eueliss and Sai-Lewq express their thanks to you and Ronitt for helping to restore Wright to some semblance of its former glory. Due to your efforts, their fields are capable of producing the barley used in their traditional ale. Now their first batch in years has been successfully brewed, allowing them to share the fruits of their labors, which certain guests have been imbibing rather liberally."
4,"TEXT_BANDWA006_03901_SEQ_04","Ozogg reveals that you have inspired her to lead her own life, free from the rules and traditions of the Gogg. In a quite literally bare-faced display of defiance, she removes her helmet, and in so doing makes herself an outcast from her village. Though she pledges her allegiance to Watts's Anvil, she is more determined than ever to outdo Ronitt and claim the heirloom of their shared ancestor."
5,"TEXT_BANDWA006_03901_SEQ_05","Upon returning to Watts's Anvil, Ronitt makes no attempt to conceal his distaste at what he considers the utmost indecency on the part of Ozogg, an act viewed with scorn by Tholl and Gogg alike. Nevertheless, it seems their destinies are intrinsically entwined as their mutual rivalry spurs them to push the boundaries of dwarven engineering. The citizens of Norvrandt, meanwhile, stand to benefit a great deal as a result of this friendly competition."
