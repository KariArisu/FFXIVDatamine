These forgotten fragments, as we call them, may very well turn the tide of the war in our favor."
53,"TEXT_LUCKSA104_03944_DMITAR_000_003","You see, much to our surprise, Master Gerolt claims to have experience working with similar crystals, and believes that the memories contained within can be extracted."
54,"TEXT_LUCKSA104_03944_DMITAR_000_004","He has set fast to work on a means to do so, and assured us it won't be long before their secrets are revealed to us."

56,"TEXT_LUCKSA104_03944_DMITAR_000_006","This assumes you are able to procure more of these fragments, of course."
57,"TEXT_LUCKSA104_03944_DMITAR_000_007","Judging by our scouts' report, it will not be an easy task. It would appear that, wherever they could be found, formidable beasts were not far behind."

64,"TEXT_LUCKSA104_03944_DMITAR_100_050","Now, before you can begin the extraction process, these shards must first be appraised so that we can tell what sort of memories they contain."
65,"TEXT_LUCKSA104_03944_DMITAR_000_051","Henceforth, be sure to hand any fragments you find to one of our appraisers. "
