1,"TEXT_LUCKSA101_03941_SEQ_01","The rebirth of Gunnhildr's Blades has sparked a fire within the Resistance, their forces drawing ever closer to Castrum Lacus Litore. Having recently reclaimed Utya's Aegis, an outpost on the southern front, Marsak has asked Sjeros to escort you there, that you might assess the situation for yourself."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA101_03941_SEQ_02","With little preamble, Sjeros agrees to guide you to Utya's Aegis, where Bajsaljen plans to introduce you to a rather remarkable group of soldiers."
3,"TEXT_LUCKSA101_03941_SEQ_03","Bajsaljen is proud to present to you the new Gunnhildr's Blades, though the members present do not comprise the guard in its entirety. The remaining members have already taken to the field, laboring to advance the front line toward the castrum. Having thus explained the situation, it occurs to Bajsaljen that you have yet to see the fortress with your own eyes. Seeking to rectify this, he invites you to look out over the battlefield and behold the object of their struggles."
4,"TEXT_LUCKSA101_03941_SEQ_04","As you look upon the castrum, towering in the distance, Bajsaljen speaks to you of their initiative to reclaim it, Operation Eagle's Nest. Before you join his troops in the field, however, he asks that you speak with Mikoto."
5,"TEXT_LUCKSA101_03941_SEQ_05","You find Mikoto in the company of Misija, and they have exciting news to share─an analysis of the crystal focus has proven that it can be recharged. The problem, however, is the means to do so requires infiltrating imperial territory. Nevertheless, plans to restore the crystal focus are well underway. Plans that will require your assistance to succeed."
6,"TEXT_LUCKSA101_03941_SEQ_06","Mikoto appears fearful of the dangers yet to come, but she understands that you both must do what needs be done. She bids you safe travels as you ready to brave the Bozjan southern front."

Isolde, the eagle eye. In brightest day or darkest night, no enemy will escape her sight.
Stanik, the unwavering blade of Bozja. The foes dashed against his shield are beyond counting."
