48,"TEXT_LUCKHA021_03972_AUGEBERT_000_000","Well, if it isn't <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Take a look around and feast your eyes on Featherfall, the latest district of the Firmament, now open for business! And needless to say, we couldn't have done it without you."
49,"TEXT_LUCKHA021_03972_AUGEBERT_000_001","As you doubtless already know, Featherfall's to serve as the Firmament's commercial district. Here you'll find a branch office of the Skysteel Manufactory, an impressive residence we call Hoarfrost Hall, and a lively marketplace where you'll find traders and merchants peddlin' goods from the realm over."
50,"TEXT_LUCKHA021_03972_AUGEBERT_000_002","Aye, no end of merchants, craftsmen, and laborers have been beatin' down our doors hopin' to make a new home here. Not that I can blame them─why, I've half a mind to relocate here myself!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKHA021_03972_AUGEBERT_000_003","Lord Francel believes it's only a matter of time before Featherfall becomes the livin', beatin' heart of the Firmament, and from the look of things, I reckon it's half there already."
52,"TEXT_LUCKHA021_03972_AUGEBERT_000_004","'Course, it's still a work in progress, and there's plenty of construction and restoration work yet to be done. If you'd be so kind as to help us keep a steady stream of supplies flowin' in, we'd be grateful as ever."
