49,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_001","...Ah, but I forget my manners. I am called Philestiaux, and Lord Francel has tasked me with overseeing the paperwork for new residents here in the Firmament."
50,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_002","Thanks in no small part due to your selfless efforts on our behalf, countless adventurers, tradesmen, and laborers from across Eorzea have chosen to make this place their home. And now that the Hoarfrost has been completed, we finally have a place to put them all."
51,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_003","There is, however, just one rub. We have─at least thus far─lacked a facility to serve the role of the Adventurers' Guilds that one might find in other nations─a role which will become increasingly vital as our population continues to grow."
52,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_004","And so, I have decided to devote this building we stand before to that very purpose. Unfortunately─and I am rather embarrassed to admit this─I am not entirely clear on precisely <Emphasis>what</Emphasis> manner of business is conducted at these guilds, and in turn, what sort of structure might best serve that purpose."
53,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_005","Pray enlighten me, friend. What would you say is the defining characteristic of an active, successful Adventurers' Guild?"
54,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
55,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_A1_000_001","A place where adventurers can come to each other's aid."

58,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_006","...I see. I have heard that in other nations, veteran types known as “mentors” oft lend their wisdom and expertise to fledgling adventurers in need. No doubt having a venue to encourage such sharing of knowledge and mutual support can only be of benefit to the community."
59,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_007","Ah, so that is the primary purpose of an Adventurers' Guild! If adventurers are to render assistance efficiently and swiftly, it certainly stands to reason that there needs to be a dedicated venue where they may receive petitions from townsfolk."
60,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_008","Now that you mention it, I imagine that adventuring must be strenuous and demanding work indeed. It stands to reason that your hardworking peers would welcome a place where they can relax and enjoy fine company and conversation over a bottle of Ishgardian brandy."
61,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_009","Thank you, my friend. The insight you have shared with me will no doubt prove invaluable in transforming this venue into one that will serve all adventurers in the Firmament, and make them feel at home."
62,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_010","If I could impose upon you just one last time, might you be willing to speak to some of your peers here in the Firmament, and see if you could find a generous soul or two who would be willing to stop by? After all, an Adventurers' Guild without adventurers is hardly worthy of the name."
63,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_011","Many thanks, my friend! I have no doubt that as the savior of Ishgard and a fellow adventurer, your words will resonate with them far more than mine ever could."
64,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_020","Have you perchance been able to recruit any of your fellow adventurers to aid in the establishment of our new Adventurers' Guild? Please, my friend, you are my best hope!"
65,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_HWDADVENTURERD03962_000_030","If it isn't <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Always a pleasure to see you, my friend. What brings you to the Firmament today?"
66,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_HWDADVENTURERD03962_000_031","They mean to build an Adventurers' Guild here in Featherfall, you say? I do believe I speak for everyone when I say this is a most welcome development, indeed."
67,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_HWDADVENTURERD03962_000_032","After all, it has been rather tedious going from door to door every day, asking the townspeople if they had any tasks requiring an adventurer's expertise. If there is anything I can do to see that the new facility is a rousing success, I am more than happy to do it."
68,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_HWDADVENTURERE03962_000_033","Hm? Is there something you need from me?"
69,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_HWDADVENTURERE03962_000_034","A new Adventurers' Guild, eh? I've only just arrived from Ul'dah, and am still learning the lay of the land. I'm not embarrassed to admit I was hoping there might be a place where I could meet some veteran types and learn a thing or two. Color me interested!"
70,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_HWDADVENTURERF03962_000_035","Need assistance with something, friend? In that case, I would encourage you to consult with one of my colleagues. I fear I'm but an apprentice here, and would have little to offer you..."
71,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_HWDADVENTURERF03962_000_036","What's that you say? A new gathering place will be opening here in the Firmament!? Why, this is wonderful news indeed!"
72,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_HWDADVENTURERF03962_000_037","I relocated here from Limsa to learn a new trade, but I must admit that I find myself feeling a touch homesick at times. I was hoping there might be a place where I could mingle with travelers and hear the latest tales and tidings from my homeland. I must visit it at once!"
73,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_040","Ah, there you are, friend! I'm pleased to inform you that a number of your peers have already graced us with their presence. Why, this place is starting to feel more and more like an honest-to-goodness Adventurers' Guild with every moment!"
74,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_041","Rest assured that I will do everything in my power to see that this place flourishes into a home away from home for all adventurers who pay visit to the Holy See."
75,"TEXT_LUCKHZ005_03962_PHILESTIAUX_000_042","Pray forgive me for imposing upon the esteemed savior of Ishgard with such a trivial task, but you have done us a great service today, and for that you have my most sincere gratitude. Whenever you are inclined to grace us with your presence, our doors will always be open."
