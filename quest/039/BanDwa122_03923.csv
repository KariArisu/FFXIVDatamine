49,"TEXT_BANDWA122_03923_REGITT_000_001","One of us could pilot the tank, of course... But, you know, I'd feel far more confident if a seasoned warrior such as yourself was guiding the cannon. Wouldn't be anywhere near as impressive if we <Emphasis>missed</Emphasis> the bloody target, eh?"
50,"TEXT_BANDWA122_03923_REGITT_000_002","Off you go, then! Wamutt will give you the pre-demonstration briefing."

52,"TEXT_BANDWA122_03923_WAMUTT_000_011","Briefing shmiefing! Just get in the tank, drive it over to Clearmelt, and blast the target into next week! Easy!"
53,"TEXT_BANDWA122_03923_WAMUTT_000_020","What are you waiting for? Head over to Clearmelt, and blow those merchants away! Uh, with the demonstration─not the cannon."
54,"TEXT_BANDWA122_03923_SYSTEM_000_021","An automaton stands immobile, awaiting its fate with what seems almost an air of resignation... Speak to Wamutt at Watts's Anvil to pilot a Rolling Tankard, then command its main cannon to fire upon the automaton target."
55,"TEXT_BANDWA122_03923_AUDIENCE03923_000_030","(-Entranced Entrepreneur-)Oh, my! That cannon has quite a kick! Let's see you fire it one more time, if you please!"
56,"TEXT_BANDWA122_03923_AUDIENCE03923_000_040","(-Entranced Entrepreneur-)Splendid! Just splendid! Enough power to discourage even the most monstrous eater, I'd wager. Mark me down as very interested, master dwarf."

58,"TEXT_BANDWA122_03923_REGITT_000_050","Now there's the grin of a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> who just left a smoking hole in the ground. I take it this means the demonstration went as planned?"
59,"TEXT_BANDWA122_03923_REGITT_000_051","Aye, we could describe it all we want, but Lorathia was right─there's naught better than showing off the destruction firsthand. I reckon we'll need to make this a regular event!"
