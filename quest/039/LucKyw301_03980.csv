1,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_01","Returning to the camp at Porta Praetoria, the Resistance officer informs you that your presence is required in Terncliff. As always, your escort stands ready to accompany you on the journey."
2,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_02","Terncliff is much the same as you remember from your previous visit, and while the imperial troops may be long gone, their enormous steel structures still mar the otherwise pleasant surroundings. Gaius and his associates have been made to wait for your arrival, as Cid would prefer to reveal his findings only when all of the relevant persons are present."
3,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_03","The investigation into the imperial facility in Terncliff has led to the discovery of the name of the VIIth Legion's third Weapon: Emerald. However, none of the locals have sighted anything resembling a large warmachina being moved from the town either by land or air. Though you cannot be certain, it seems likely that the Weapon was transported by sea, possibly to Castrum Marinum or Castrum Occidens in order to complete its construction. You and Gaius elect to investigate the former while Severa and Valdeaulin head for the latter. A member of the Ironworks has been ordered to prepare a submersible in Vesper Bay that you may make your approach."
4,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_04","It appears that Gaius possesses a means of breaching the security system of Castrum Marinum and entering via the dry dock. Once you arrive, however, there is a fairly high chance that you will be greeted by the enigmatic Emerald Weapon, so you had best be prepared for the worst.

※Castrum Marinum can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
5,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_05","The confrontation with the Emerald Weapon called on every last onze of mettle you could muster, and once the dust had settled, it was you that emerged the victor. Overlooking the wreckage is Gaius, who mourns the loss of its pilot Rex, one of the orphans he raised."
6,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_06","Following the battle, you are joined by Valdeaulin and Severa, whose mission to Castrum Occidens yielded little of value. After arriving in Castrum Marinum, they found Allie, another of Gaius's orphans, locked in a cell and decided to free her. She is filled with horror by the spectacle of the destroyed Emerald Weapon and descends into a state of shock. It seems the best recourse is to take her to Terncliff and allow her time to recover from the ordeal."
7,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_07","According to Severa, Allie's body is covered in welts and bruises that were most likely inflicted by the imperials under whom she served. Severa knows from personal experience the cruel treatment of those who are not pure-blooded Garleans, and she relates her tale of how she came to defect from the imperial army. Meanwhile, Allie continues to recuperate, and she may now be well enough to speak of what has befallen her and the other orphans, though it would be prudent to first discuss her current condition with Valdeaulin."
8,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_08","Allie has made great strides in recovering both physically and mentally, and is able to provide useful information on the present state of affairs and on Valens van Varro, legatus of the VIIth Legion. As she explains it, Valens is both jealous and cruel, and is willing to use any means at his disposal to achieve his goals, no matter how vile they may be. She also tells of Alfonse's dream of using the power granted to him by the Weapon project to break free from the Empire and establish a safe haven for those who wish to live in peace. Unfortunately, she is unable to say where he is, meaning that you will need to enlist the aid of the Alliance's scouts in locating him. With no immediate danger on the horizon, now seems an opportune time to return to the Resistance troops in Gyr Abania and report the latest series of events."
9,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_09","Your report is gratefully received by the Resistance officer in charge at Porta Praetoria. He will prepare a written copy of the information that has been gathered, should you wish to review it before being called into action once more."

56,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_053","So, what have you discovered?"
57,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_054","To tell the truth, we were lucky to obtain any information at all, considering the lengths to which the imperials went in covering their tracks. You see, the hangar below was not just used to store the Weapons, but played a critical role in their creation."
58,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_055","We now know the code names given to three of the Weapons. Ruby, Sapphire...and Emerald."
59,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEVERA_000_056","Obviously, we are all familiar with the first two, but the third is something of an unknown quantity."
60,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_VALDEAULIN_000_057","At the very least, this confirms the existence of another of those abominations."

64,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_059","The problem lies in ascertaining its whereabouts. None of the locals have seen anything resembling a Weapon being transported either by land or air."
65,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_060","Which of course leaves only one option: the sea. According to what fragmented data we were able to recover, the Emerald Weapon is equipped with aquatic capabilities, much like the Sapphire."
66,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_061","Meaning that its escape from Terncliff would have gone undetected, and could potentially be anywhere by now. But if Alfonse plans to have it absorb more primals..."
67,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_062","...the logical choice would be Eorzea."
68,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEVERA_000_063","And traveling by sea would allow him to circumvent the front line at Ghimlyt entirely! The Alliance must be alerted at once!"
69,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_064","Hold your chocobos, Severa. It seems that the Emerald Weapon was still incomplete when the VIIth Legion withdrew from Terncliff."
70,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_065","It's far more likely that it was transported to another facility in order to add the finishing touches."
71,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_066","If your supposition is correct, that would narrow our search to but two possible locations: Castrum Marinum in the Rhotano Sea and Castrum Occidens in eastern La Noscea."
72,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_VALDEAULIN_000_067","Both of which are known to harbor remnants of the XIVth Legion...your former subordinates, Gaius."
73,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_068","Be that as it may, our objective is unchanged. Valdeaulin, you and Severa will make your way to Castrum Occidens while <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and I head for Castrum Marinum."
74,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEVERA_000_069","Should we locate the Emerald Weapon, we will give the signal to dispatch the G-Warrior and eliminate it before it can be activated."
75,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_070","Sorry to disappoint you, but we're still repairing the damage it sustained during the encounter with the Sapphire Weapon. While Allagan machinery has its uses, it's a bugger to find replacement parts in a pinch..."
76,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_100_070","We've actually been working to expand its already impressive arsenal, but the G-Warrior itself is in no fit state for combat."
77,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_071","While I'm aware this is a far from adequate replacement, I can provide an Ironworks submersible to help <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Gaius reach Castrum Marinum. I'll have one sent ahead to Vesper Bay."
78,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_VALDEAULIN_000_072","A submersible, eh? I don't much like the sound of that.

80,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEVERA_000_075","It seems that Cid is not in the habit of saying the same thing twice, which must be why he has been waiting for you to arrive before revealing the results of his investigation."
81,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_VALDEAULIN_000_080","Though the imperials may be gone, the scars they have left on this once-peaceful town will doubtless take many years to heal."

86,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_GSPILOT03980_100_100","But before you depart, I've received some scraps of intelligence regarding your opponent from my colleagues in Terncliff."
87,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_GSPILOT03980_200_100","Apparently, it uses some sort of levitating...handlike appendages─six of them, in fact─though we're not quite sure what purpose they serve. It sounds like having eyes in the back of your head might come in handy. But that's all we know, I'm afraid."
88,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_101","You have our thanks. After all, forewarned is forearmed. If the Emerald Weapon has indeed been transported to this castrum, it would need to enter via the dry dock. We shall do likewise."
89,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_102","As one might expect, there are measures in place to keep out intruders, but the security systems can be tricked into recognizing us as an imperial vessel."
90,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_100_102","That said, infiltrating the facility is merely the first step..."
91,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_103","Should the Emerald Weapon be activated, it is only a matter of time before the pilot uses Oversoul."
92,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_104","We must silence the warmachina before this happens, and failing that, grant the poor soul at its helm the mercy of a swift death."

94,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_110","In the event that my attempt to bypass the castrum's security fails, this submersible of Cid's had best be able to withstand imperial weaponry long enough for us to escape."
95,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_GSPILOT03980_000_150","I'm sorry we weren't able to provide any further details on the target. We can only guess what other tricks it might have in store for you. Be careful out there."
96,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_155","Though I would prefer that we avoid engaging my former wards in combat, we cannot allow my sentiments to prevent us from doing what must be done."

101,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_200_202","It galls me to think that my techniques and strategies could be so closely replicated. Nevertheless, the observations I made during the battle may yet prove useful. As a matter of fact, that was not the only information I was able to gather."
102,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_203","I intercepted a signal that revealed the troops stationed here were permitted to withdraw, seemingly in return for assisting the VIIth Legion. They must have known that the Alliance would follow the Emerald Weapon here sooner or later and made good their escape."
103,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_204","Meaning the way is now clear for Cid to inspect the warmachina's remains."

106,"TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_206","From what we know, it seems that the Emerald Weapon was ilm for ilm a great deal more powerful than the previous two. If this is allowed to continue, who knows what sort of monstrosity the VIIth Legion will conceive next."
