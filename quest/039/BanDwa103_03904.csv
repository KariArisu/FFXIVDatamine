52,"TEXT_BANDWA103_03904_SHIGITT_000_013","Right, so what I need from you is four padded cushions for the tank's interior─we need to make sure the automaton inside is properly protected from impacts. Start with these materials, and let me know if you need more."
53,"TEXT_BANDWA103_03904_SHIGITT_000_014","Right, so what I need from you is four durable tracks of rubber for the wheels─when the going gets rough, we'll want the tank to keep rolling. Start with these ingredients, and let me know if you need more."
