54,"TEXT_LUCKSA106_03946_MEESIYA_000_004","It may seem somewhat far-fetched, but the theory is sound. Think of the aether currents as streams flowing underground which, at certain locations, converge into larger rivers. The streams can prove quite difficult to trace. The rivers, less so. "
55,"TEXT_LUCKSA106_03946_MEESIYA_000_005","As you might imagine, because these rivers are a confluence of myriad streams, it is no simple task to filter out and extract aether of a specific frequency."
56,"TEXT_LUCKSA106_03946_MEESIYA_000_006","Which is why before anything can be done, we first need a thorough analysis of the aether flowing through these larger currents."
