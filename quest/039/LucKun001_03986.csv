1,"TEXT_LUCKUN001_03986_SEQ_01","Cyella speaks to you of Unukalhai, a fellow lost soul from the Thirteenth shard. Though he formerly served Elidibus, with the emissary gone, he will be wanting for purpose─a feeling Cyella knows all too well. Concerned for the boy's well-being, she asks that you offer him your support when next you meet in the Source."
2,"TEXT_LUCKUN001_03986_SEQ_02","You find Unukalhai in the Rising Stones. It seems he too remembers Cyella─who he knows as Cylva─fondly from their meeting after the fall of the Thirteenth, and is indeed at a loose end as she speculated. In light of both of these truths, he wonders if he mightn't seek her counsel as to what course he should pursue next. The two of you ask the opinion of Urianger, who confirms that this could theoretically be accomplished with the use of a spirit vessel, and agrees to perform the necessary magicks."
3,"TEXT_LUCKUN001_03986_SEQ_03","After only a short wait, Urianger presents you with Unukalhai's spirit vessel. He mentions that transferring the boy into the vessel posed little problem, as he─much like the Ascians with whom you have become so familiar─is a spirit without permanent corporeal form, but cautions you that this very state may pose a problem for Unukalhai at some point in the future."
4,"TEXT_LUCKUN001_03986_SEQ_04","After crossing to the First, you seek out Beq Lugg. Though they are a bit put out by your recklessness in bringing another soul across the rift, they confirm that they can draw Unukalhai from the vessel and reconstitute him. At your insistence, they also agree to meet you at the Wandering Stairs when the task is accomplished, that you might drop a hint to Cyella in the meantime."
5,"TEXT_LUCKUN001_03986_SEQ_05","You keep Cyella waiting in suspense for longer than intended before Beq Lugg and Unukalhai make their appearance. When the discussion turns to the history of the Thirteenth, he wonders aloud if it might not be possible to restore balance to that world in the same way you did for the First. Beq Lugg suggests that a thorough understanding of the state of affairs there is necessary to truly know one way or the other. For that, however, you will need to open a gate to the void."
6,"TEXT_LUCKUN001_03986_SEQ_06","Taynor, resident expert on hollows and the creation thereof, is thankfully not far away, and Unukalhai wastes no time in asking him if he can open a voidgate. Taynor is initially reticent, pointing out that he is unable to perform a spell of the necessary power without assistance, and that it took him and Nyelbert years of training before they were able to do any such thing─but Cyella suggests that Unukalhai use his talent to intuit via aether the memories and emotions that remain in Nyelbert's crystal. This enables him to understand much of what is required for the technique, as well as how badly Nyelbert wanted to save Taynor from his accidental exile. Moved by his friend's dedication, Taynor is inspired to join hands with Unukalhai and put the power to create hollows to good use at last."
