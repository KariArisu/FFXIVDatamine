48,"TEXT_BANDWA104_03905_REGITT_000_001","Bugger me silly! When we came here, no one had the courtesy to tell us these gremlins would be even more of a pain in the arse than hobgoblins! Just imagining those bug-eyes and mangy fur gets my blood boiling something fierce."
49,"TEXT_BANDWA104_03905_REGITT_000_002","As if their incessant chattering wasn't enough of a nuisance, the soldiers at the Ostall Imperative tell me they have a natural curiosity for machinery─a curiosity that ends with the machines in a pile of scrap more often than not."
50,"TEXT_BANDWA104_03905_REGITT_000_003","Needless to say, we can't suffer an infestation of those vermin. That's why, with the help of those aforementioned soldiers, I've built these traps to keep them at bay. Go ahead and lay them around for me, would you?"

54,"TEXT_BANDWA104_03905_REGITT_000_021","To think that the sight of mere sweets would inspire such fear in the gremlins. If what the soldiers told me is true, however, it's not the sweets themselves that are dangerous so much as what they herald: pixies!"
55,"TEXT_BANDWA104_03905_REGITT_000_022","Legend has it that if you spot candy in the wild, those winged hoodwinkers will be nearby. And for all the gremlins' penchant for trickery, even they wouldn't dare get between a pixie and their confectionary. Perhaps when I set the traps next, I'll stay behind to see if the stories are true. "
