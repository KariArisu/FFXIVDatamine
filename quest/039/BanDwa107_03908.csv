48,"TEXT_BANDWA107_03908_REGITT_000_001","So, you've been wandering around the Anvil for a while now. Out of all the myriad materials we produce here, which do you reckon is the one we use the most of on a day-to-day basis?"
49,"TEXT_BANDWA107_03908_REGITT_000_002","If you guessed steel plates, then congratulations─seems your eyes are as keen as your hands. Indeed, the sound of a hammer on steel is the sound of creation here at the Anvil─the birth of anything from a simple chest to a tank fit for combat."
50,"TEXT_BANDWA107_03908_REGITT_000_003","Just like your eyes and your hands, I suppose your mind is keen enough to gather what I might be asking you to make next, then.

54,"TEXT_BANDWA107_03908_DAILYDWARF03908_000_012","I think a few ingots ought to help us along. Three, to be precise. This ore I've procured should suffice, but if for whatever reason you run out of materials, just get more from the automaton."
55,"TEXT_BANDWA107_03908_DAILYDWARF03908_000_013","A proper sheet of metal has to be scoured to a mirror shine, and for that we need the proper tools. Here, take these and let's see what you can come up with. If for whatever reason you run out of materials, just get more from the automaton."
56,"TEXT_BANDWA107_03908_DAILYDWARF03908_000_014","Dull metal reflects the dullness of the builder's ambition, and so we polish our sheets to a mirror shine.
