113,"TEXT_LUCKSA110_03950_MEESIYA_000_332","A primal summoning, yes. Though perhaps it would be more fitting to call it an eikon. The blade was, after all, originally a relic stolen from the Allagans."

115,"TEXT_LUCKSA110_03950_MEESIYA_000_334","There was one problem, however. The queen knew that, once she took in the power of this god, there would be no turning back. She was a coward, and despite her duty to protect the people, she chose her own life over theirs."
116,"TEXT_LUCKSA110_03950_MEESIYA_000_335","Yet Gunnhildr's Blades would not see their efforts come to naught. For they soon realized the sacrifice need not be the presently reigning queen. Nor did they need to be of noble blood."
117,"TEXT_LUCKSA110_03950_MEESIYA_000_336","And so a lowborn shrine maiden was chosen to ascend the throne. Obedient to a fault, she did not hesitate to give her life to forestall the coming Calamity."
118,"TEXT_LUCKSA110_03950_MEESIYA_000_337","Would that this tragic tale end there, but I'm afraid it takes a rather bloody turn."
119,"TEXT_LUCKSA110_03950_MEESIYA_000_338","You see, despite sacrificing herself to save Bozja, the new queen did not die, nor was she consumed by the eikon's power."
120,"TEXT_LUCKSA110_03950_MIKOTO_000_339","There was a woman of Ishgard, Ysayle, capable of such a feat. But to embrace the power of the eikon and retain her sense of self...that would mean this queen possessed the Echo."
121,"TEXT_LUCKSA110_03950_MEESIYA_000_340","And her power struck fear into the hearts of Gunnhildr's Blades, for a god now walked among them."
