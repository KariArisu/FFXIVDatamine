1,"TEXT_LUCKYB815_03965_SEQ_01","With needless formality, an Ishgardian gentleman inquires as to whether you know Khloe Aliapoh. As you, in fact, do, he subsequently explains that she is inviting all of her acquaintances to come and play with her new friend─a fox that evidently bears some resemblance to an unspecified intimidating personage."
2,"TEXT_LUCKYB815_03965_SEQ_02","You seek out Khloe's new friend─who it transpires has been dubbed the “faux commander” by Rowena for his supposed resemblance to the lord commander of Ishgard─and he explains that, not unlike Khloe herself, he is in search of wondrous tales of adventure. He is quite fantastical himself, however, and thus requires stories that are all the more incredible for it. You will need to chase your wildest imaginings if you are to satisfy his demands and gain access to Faux Hollows and its fabulous prizes."

52,"TEXT_LUCKYB815_03965_ISHGARDMAN_000_001","It seems the word I bear will indeed be of interest to you, then. You see─Miss Aliapoh has a new pet fox, and she has made it known that her most feal of acquaintances─which include me, naturally─are invited to regale him with tales for “fantastical” rewards!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKYB815_03965_ISHGARDMAN_000_002","Surely Miss Aliapoh believes her furry friend to share in her appreciation for tales of gallantry─and I daresay my heritage makes me something of an expert. Alas...the resemblance is simply too uncanny. I cannot go near the creature without feeling as if I'm being judged."
54,"TEXT_LUCKYB815_03965_ISHGARDMAN_000_003","My honor will not allow me to simply ignore the invitation, however─so I thought you might wait upon the fox in my stead. The children have taken to calling him “Commander,” for reasons most obvious. You will certainly know him when you see him."

61,"TEXT_LUCKYB815_03965_FAUXCOMMANDER_000_012","Yes, yes, “Eek, a talking fox!” this, “Seven hells, that ain't natural!” that. You are all so very melodramatic. I daresay if you were ever to meet my fellows at Reisen Temple you'd drop dead out of sheer commitment to theater."
62,"TEXT_LUCKYB815_03965_FAUXCOMMANDER_000_013","Hilarious.

Regardless, make good use of your cunning─and luck─and I will conjure you faux leaves as tokens of my esteem. As you have doubtless guessed, a sufficiency of leaves can be traded for other, less ephemeral incentives."
73,"TEXT_LUCKYB815_03965_FAUXCOMMANDER_000_023","I believe that's the long and short of it, as the youths say─but don't get ahead of yourself. As I said, no ordinary story will do.
