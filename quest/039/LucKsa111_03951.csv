1,"TEXT_LUCKSA111_03951_SEQ_01","The Resistance has fought valiantly to force imperial troops to fall back into the castrum, and at last Operation Eagle's Nest can be seen through to completion. Bajsaljen is ready to lead Gunnhildr's Blades into the belly of the beast, and he can think of no better soldier than you to accompany them.

※Players may enter Castrum Lacus Litore via the associated critical engagement."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA111_03951_SEQ_02","Your defeat of the imperial soldiers is almost effortless. Before you can plot your next move, however, Misija appears before you with Mikoto, as well as the crystal focus and the legendary blade Save the Queen. Using Mikoto as leverage, Misija coerces you into activating the crystal focus to explore the memories of the holy blade. Her intent is soon made clear when, moments later, Queen Gunnhildr emerges as a primal-like entity, enslaving the minds of the soldiers bearing the title of her guard. The threat of the queen proved too great, forcing the Resistance to retreat from the castrum."
3,"TEXT_LUCKSA111_03951_SEQ_03","After regrouping at Utya's Aegis, you discuss the events that took place in the castrum. Mikoto explains that Misija discovered a way to alter the memories of Save the Queen, thereby allowing her to call forth Queen Gunnhildr in a fashion not unlike primal summoning. Having now lost both the castrum and Gunnhildr's Blades, the Resistance must think long and hard on how next to proceed."
4,"TEXT_LUCKSA111_03951_SEQ_04","The Resistance suffered a grave defeat at Castrum Lacus Litore, but they are not discouraged. Marsak informs you that reinforcements from Dalmasca have recently arrived, with more en route from the Eastern alliance. Though it will take time, the Resistance will not rest until Bozja is free from imperial rule."
