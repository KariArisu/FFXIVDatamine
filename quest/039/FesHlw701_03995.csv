0,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_00","The Adventurers' Guild investigator is on the lookout for a suspiciously scary personage.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_01","The Adventurers' Guild investigator relates to you his plight: as All Saints' Eve approaches, a shifty figure known as the Scarlet Snout has been making the rounds about Gridania, unsettling the local populace. Sadly, the investigator's best efforts have turned up little in the way of leads as to what this individual is up to. At his behest, you agree to aid him in his quest by inquiring among the locals in hopes of learning more about this red-nosed ruffian.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_02","Through your inquiries with the townspeople─some more cooperative than others─it soon becomes apparent that the Scarlet Snout has made contact with several individuals, inviting more than a few of them to a banquet of sorts. Concerned for their fate, you begin to make your way back to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to relate to the guild investigator all that has transpired."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_03","After conferring with the investigator, you agree that the best course of action is for you to attempt to initiate contact with the Scarlet Snout yourself. At your client's behest, you set out to lie in wait by the river near the Leatherworkers' Guild until the man with the protuberant proboscis approaches you."
4,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_04","Sure enough, the so-called Scarlet Snout─now revealed to be an itinerant clown by the name of Papa Gruff─finds you and extends an invitation to his banquet, much as he did with the other residents of Gridania. Unable to yet discern whether he means well or ill, you head back to the Leatherworkers' Guild to inform the investigator of your meeting and discuss your next course of action."
5,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_05","Hearing your story, the Adventurers' Guild investigator is duly suspicious, but nevertheless suggests playing along with your quarry, that you might obtain more concrete information. So it is that you make for Bentbranch Meadows, where you will seek out a vantage point a stone's throw from the agreed-upon location, that you might spy upon Papa Gruff and his interactions with his other guests from a safe distance."
6,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_06","As you survey the scene, it does not take long for the entire Gruff clan to appear. A chill runs up your spine as you overhear them discussing their dark plot to realize something called the Night of Devilry by feeding on the fear and life energies of their guests. Somewhat shaken, you decide to return to the investigator and elucidate to him this rather disturbing turn of events."
7,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_07","The investigator is to no small degree concerned, but at the same time assures you that the Adventurers' Guild has sent aid in the form of an expert on all matters occult. Going off to see to your preparations, you agree to return to the investigator when you are ready to meet the man in question and see what perfect plan he has devised."

No, they are generally harmless, which is why I have been content to observe them from afar.

79,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_042","Speaking of which, I was able to uncover some new information myself. It would seem most sightings of the Scarlet Snout occurred by the river."
