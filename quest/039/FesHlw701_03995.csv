※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_01","Upon speaking with the Adventurers' Guild investigator you learn that he wishes to look into a rather suspicious man known as the Scarlet Snout. You agree to aid him in his quest by asking the locals about the red-nosed ruffian. 

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_02","It soon becomes apparent that the Scarlet Snout has made contact with several people, inviting them to a banquet of sorts. You make your way back to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to fill in the guild investigator."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_03","It is agreed that the best course of action is for you to make direct contact with the Scarlet Snout yourself. The investigator asks you to lie in wait by the river near the Leatherworkers' Guild until the clownlike gentleman approaches you."
4,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_04","Sure enough, the Scarlet Snout finds you and extends an invitation to his banquet in the same way he did for the other denizens of Gridania. You head back to the Leatherworkers' Guild to inform the investigator of your meeting."
5,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_05","After hearing what you have to say, the Adventurers' Guild investigator bids you lie in wait near the spot where you are meant to meet the Scarlet Snout once more."
6,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_06","It does not take long for the entire Snout clan to appear. You overhear them discussing their scheme to realize the Night of Devilry by turning their guests into empty shells devoid of life. Slightly shaken, you make your way to explain the situation to the investigator."
7,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_07","The investigator reveals that the Adventurers' Guild have sent you some succor in the form of an expert on all things occult. You agree to tell the investigator once you are ready to speak with the man and begin to form the perfect plan."

49,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_001","You see, as you are doubtless aware, All Saints' Wake is nearly upon us and yet I have seen no sign of those fiends from the Continental Circus."

52,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_004","The people of Eorzea know them as a traveling troupe of entertainers who visit whenever All Saints' Wake is upon us. However, in actuality they are a band of voidsent fiends in disguise."
53,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_005","That is not to say they get up to anything that goes beyond the realm of mere mischief. No, they are generally harmless which is why I have been content to observe them from afar. Bizarrely I am yet to see any sign of them this time round despite the festivities being so close at hand."
54,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_006","That said, I do not mean to say that things have been uneventful of late. A rather peculiar gentleman known as the Scarlet Snout has appeared to fill the vacuum of absurdity left by the Circus."
55,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_007","Most suspicious as I'm sure you will agree. Which is why I set about investigating the matter, however things have not quite gone to plan and I was hoping you might be able to help me look into this strange character."

67,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_CITIZENC03995_000_025","F-fine! I'll tell you all I know. I was heading home from an errand and this red-nosed man told me to visit his house—said he needed someone to share his toys and sweets with."
68,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_CITIZENC03995_000_026","Although, he told me I was forbidden to speak of our meeting, never mind that he'd invited me to his banquet... Please don't tell anyone else!"

70,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_CITIZEND03995_000_028","I've indeed met the man you speak of. In fact, he invited me to a feast! Yes, I was relaxing by the river the other night when I suddenly heard a voice that I couldn't quite place."
71,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_CITIZEND03995_000_029","I turned to see a clownlike gentleman right behind me. It soon became apparent that we got along quite well and that was when he asked me to join him for dinner."
72,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_CITIZEND03995_000_030","Yes, I recall him saying he was only inviting a few friends of his and that it would be a modest affair. Oh, don't tell anyone else I told you about this, all right?"

78,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_041","Most interesting. I highly doubt he is inviting these people out of the kindness of his heart. No, there must be more to it."
79,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_042","I suppose I should share with you what I have learned: most of the sightings of the Scarlet Snout occurred by the river."
80,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_043","One would imagine it would be relatively easy to spot him if we staked out the area. However, I have been at this long enough that I am sure the Snout knows me by now."
81,"TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_INVESTIGATOR03995_000_044","I realize this is terribly impudent of me, but could I ask you to take care of this alone? I promise to watch you from the shadows so that I can lend a helping hand should you need it."
