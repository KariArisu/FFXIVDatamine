1,"TEXT_JOBAOZ701_03994_SEQ_01","Martyn congratulates you on your victory over the Master of Mimicry, and his praise is soon echoed by P'yandih and Royse. Gogo himself arrives and bows to your skill, but Nutiba is concerned at how Kageyama will react. As if on cue, the Kugane merchant appears on the scene in a state of denial, refusing to accept the reality of the defeat. Royse, unconcerned by this development, then springs her trap, which sees Kageyama apprehended by the Brass Blades on charges of smuggling.

His fiancée freed from the threat of violence, a relieved Nutiba at last feels safe enough to close down the Fukumen Fighting Festival. Gogo, however, suddenly begs Royse to reconsider, and allow their arena to continue as a joint venture under her management. Royse agrees to the request, and thus the Far Eastern chapters of the Masked Carnivale and the Blue Mages' Guild are made official. With matters brought to a satisfactory conclusion, your friends and former foes go their separate ways, leaving you behind with a whimsical-minded guildmaster."
2,"TEXT_JOBAOZ701_03994_SEQ_02","Martyn reflects on the travails of this most recent adventure, realizing that there are yet many untapped wonders awaiting you in this world. New costumes, new magic, new horizons─who knows where you might go from here..."

70,"TEXT_JOBAOZ701_03994_ROYSE_000_017","Don't you worry your head about that, darling. It was your testimony which exposed his smuggling in the first place! Once I'd added in the tale of your extenuating circumstances, I was able to wrangle a deal with the authorities to let you walk free."

76,"TEXT_JOBAOZ701_03994_GOGO_000_021","Before this goes any further, pray hear my request. Our arena was an imitation of your Masked Carnivale, that much is now obvious...but that in itself was never the issue."
77,"TEXT_JOBAOZ701_03994_GOGO_000_022","The problem lay in imitation without permission. If you would but give us your blessing, I would like to continue our performances in some form of joint venture.

85,"TEXT_JOBAOZ701_03994_PYANDIH_000_030","And that's my cue to hand things back to the guildmaster. If I'm to perform properly as the fantastic Azuro the Fourth, I have some serious training to catch up on!"
86,"TEXT_JOBAOZ701_03994_ROYSE_000_031","P'yandih has the right of it, darlings. We have legitimate competition now in the Far East, and we cannot let the Masked Carnivale be overshadowed. The show must go on!"
87,"TEXT_JOBAOZ701_03994_MARTYN_000_040","Gogo's art might well be inimitable, but you, my friend, are bloody unbeatable. And what's more, your victory is further proof that blue magic is the solution to any complication."
88,"TEXT_JOBAOZ701_03994_MARTYN_000_041","I tell you what, though, this little adventure has opened my eyes to a whole new world of untapped wonders. If we mean to keep learnin' from every opportunity in the realm, I think we'll be needin' thicker spellbooks..."
