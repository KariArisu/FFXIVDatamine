1,"TEXT_LUCKHA202_03956_SEQ_01","Heartened by your success in Gridania, Lord Francel is eager to make for Ul'dah, the Jewel of the Desert, where he hopes to find yet another prestigious trading partner willing to bring their wares to the Firmament. Lord Charlemend, too, is anxious to move on, convinced that the cultured upper crust types of the sultanate will be more receptive to his approach than the common merchants of Gridania. You promise to reconvene with your companions at the Ruby Road Exchange and offer what aid you can."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHA202_03956_SEQ_02","No sooner do you arrive in Ul'dah than does Lord Charlemend once more strike out on his own, paying Francel's words of warning little heed. At the young lord's request, you set out to find the count before he can do more damage to your cause with his arrogant and abrasive approach."
3,"TEXT_LUCKHA202_03956_SEQ_03","Amidst the stalls and markets of the Ruby Road Exchange, you come upon Lord Charlemend engaged in a verbal dispute with a local purveyor of rumors and secrets. Fearing that the stodgy aristocrat has truly bitten off more than he can chew this time, you are relieved when your acquaintance Lord Emmanellain arrives on the scene, skillfully defusing a potentially problematic situation with his silver tongue. After a brief exchange, the free-spirited nobleman offers to arrange a partnership with a prominent merchant─in exchange for a verbal promise that a good word will be put in for him with his beloved Lady Laniaitte─and his dutiful manservant Honoroit promises to see that the deal is brought to completion. Breathing a sigh of relief at having avoided a complete breakdown of negotiations, you set off to relay the good news to Lord Francel."
4,"TEXT_LUCKHA202_03956_SEQ_04","Francel rejoices upon hearing of your successes, offering his deepest gratitude and expressing admiration for the strong bonds of friendship you have forged with many illustrious and influential personages throughout the realm. Clearly taking umbrage that the mission has once again succeeded despite─and not because of─his best efforts, Lord Charlemend grumbles and grouses as the three of you prepare to strike out for your next destination."

I hear that they call Ul'dah the Jewel of the Desert, and that it is a bustling center of trade and commerce. I can scarce wait to see what opportunities await us there."
49,"TEXT_LUCKHA202_03956_CHARLEMEND_000_001","I have it on good account that the sultanate is an affluent and cultured nation, with a populace that places due importance on status and lineage. Unlike the rabble here, its people will no doubt afford me the respect I deserve."
50,"TEXT_LUCKHA202_03956_FRANCEL_000_002","According to my research, the market district of Ul'dah is centered around a location known as the Ruby Road Exchange. I propose that we make that our first destination."
51,"TEXT_LUCKHA202_03956_FRANCEL_000_003","As you may know, the exchange has quite a long and storied history. It is also conveniently located just a stone's throw from the airship landing where we are to touch down."

57,"TEXT_LUCKHA202_03956_CHARLEMEND_000_022","The array of wares is respectable, I'll allow, but I've no interest in dealing with threadbare peddlers. Let us find ourselves a trader with a proper pedigree."
