1,"TEXT_LUCKHA301_03999_SEQ_01","Lord Francel rejoices upon seeing you approach, once more extending his profuse gratitude for all you have done to help him realize his vision of a Firmament fully reborn. Reflecting on the importance of culture, the arts, and entertainment and the role these all play in sustaining a living, breathing city, he invites you on a tour of the newly opened Risensong Quarter─a district which he hopes will serve precisely that role for the Firmament as a whole. Should you be so inclined as to take him up on his offer, join him at Ser Vaindreau's Grace."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHA301_03999_SEQ_02","You convene with Lord Francel at Ser Vaindreau's Grace, the Firmament's most impressive new infirmary. Here, as your good friend tells it, any and all people in Ishgard may seek succor and reprieve from their wounds and ailments regardless of their status or station. Your conversation is interrupted by an artist whom you recognize as something of a celebrity in these parts. Gushing with adoration, he thanks you profusely for your role in ending the war, which allowed him to put down his blade in favor of the brush and palette he had dreamed of taking in hand for so long. Thanking him for the sentiment, you make ready to join Francel at the next destination on your excursion─the bathhouses of Snowsoak Springs. "
3,"TEXT_LUCKHA301_03999_SEQ_03","Admiring the elegant architecture and steaming thermal baths of Snowsoak Springs, your conversation with Francel is interrupted by a couple of familiar faces─itinerant artisans who worked alongside you in the reconstruction effort. Though pleased at a job well done, they lament that the completion of the reconstruction effort means that they must now go separate ways with their beloved chief who was a stern-yet-gentle guiding hand throughout the long process. Speaking from your own experience traveling the realm, you assure them that farewell need not be forever, a sentiment which heartens them somewhat. Your work here done, you set off to rejoin Francel where you started, in the center of the Risensong Quarter."
4,"TEXT_LUCKHA301_03999_SEQ_04","Standing at the center of the newly opened quarter with Lord Francel, you survey your surroundings and marvel at how remarkably this place has flourished in such a short time. Your reverie is interrupted by the arrival of Conon, a former acquaintance who has recovered from his wounds to be up on his feet once more. After thanking you for introducing him to Marcelloix and his marvelous remedies, he asks if he might trouble you for your advice on a matter of concern. With Francel returning to see to various administrative affairs, you elect to entertain the young man's offer to see if there is aught aid you might lend him."
