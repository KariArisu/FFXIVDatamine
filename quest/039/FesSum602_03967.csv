55,"TEXT_FESSUM602_03967_GEGERUJU_000_013","Ah, yes, the dance! A most curious thing!"

80,"TEXT_FESSUM602_03967_HILDELANA_000_040","It reminds me of my days with the Cascadiers, when we beat the Bombards back by the skin of our teeth. What a reversal that this year our former foes would play a part in our salvation!"

84,"TEXT_FESSUM602_03967_BEAUDEFOIN_000_044","Now that's a dance! Graceful yet powerful, refined yet torrid─it is summer embodied!"
85,"TEXT_FESSUM602_03967_HILDELANA_000_045","Its simplicity belies the power of its motions. I must admit, I'm somewhat hesitant to perform such a dance in front of Master Gegeruju, but as long as I'm not alone I'm sure I'll overcome my stage fright."
86,"TEXT_FESSUM602_03967_BEAUDEFOIN_000_046","But first, we must practice!"
87,"TEXT_FESSUM602_03967_JIRIRI_000_050","I never imagined so many would be so eager to learn the flame dance. Thank you. If only my grandmother were here to see this...I have no doubt it would bring a smile to her face."
88,"TEXT_FESSUM602_03967_JIRIRI_000_051","While even a single dancer can make a strong impression, compared to a group performing in unison they are as a candle before a blazing bonfire. I've arranged matching attire for each of you, that your fire might burn ever brighter."
89,"TEXT_FESSUM602_03967_JIRIRI_000_052","Once you've dressed for the occasion, meet us on the beach and we shall usher in the arrival of peace to the Moonfire Faire!"
