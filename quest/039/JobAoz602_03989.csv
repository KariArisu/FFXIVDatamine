0,"TEXT_JOBAOZ602_03989_SEQ_00","Martyn seems pleased to see you."
1,"TEXT_JOBAOZ602_03989_SEQ_01","Martyn gives you a hearty welcome, and quickly fills you in on the latest guild news. Soon after, one of his disciples, P'yandih, arrives to undertake a test of her abilities, but Martyn's teaching schedule is thrown into disarray by the sudden appearance of Royse. It seems the Celestium's manager is hosting distinguished visitors from the Far East, and requires the Great Azuro─or one of his incarnations─to put on an impressive show for these potential investors. Finding himself otherwise engaged, Martyn imposes upon you to administer P'yandih's exam. All you need to do, he claims, is oversee the young mage's battle with some tentacled horror─with said horror patiently awaiting your coming in central Thanalan."
2,"TEXT_JOBAOZ602_03989_SEQ_02","You avail yourself of the tentacled voidsent's martial services, and P'yandih employs her spellcraft to pummel the creature beyond the point of submission. Satisfied with her progress and wondering if Martyn might be finished with his exhibition match, the two of you turn back towards Ul'dah."
3,"TEXT_JOBAOZ602_03989_SEQ_03","You return to the guild, but it seems Royse's guests from the Far East were less than impressed with the Masked Carnivale, calling it a poor recreation of the “Fukumen Fighting Festival.” Incensed that someone has stolen the idea for her enterprise, Royse orders Martyn to Kugane to investigate, leaving you behind to supervise the guild and the newly dubbed “Azuro the Fourth.”

※The next blue mage quest will be available from P'yandih upon reaching level 63 and learning Basic Instinct."
