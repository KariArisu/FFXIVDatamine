0,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_00","There once was a dwarf named Ronitt
A boy with a bee in his bonnet.
He had agreed to a bet
He would come to regret,
Unless, of course, he actually won it."
1,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_01","The wager with Chief Xamott has prompted several Tholls to return to Tomra for fear of banishment in the event that Ronitt fails. He must produce five Rolling Tankards by the designated day, which is becoming increasingly unlikely as his workforce diminishes. He decides to take a stroll, ostensibly to clear his head, but through a rather obvious attempt at reverse psychology, he strongly implies that he wants you to follow him.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_02","Ronitt's plan to lure you away from the Anvil has worked, and he can now air his concerns without the other dwarves overhearing. He reveals that he is finding the burden of responsibility too much to bear, and turns to you for advice. Your words of wisdom soon lift his spirits, but it is the surprise arrival of Regitt, Karutt, and Ronitt's dwarven relations protocol automaton, the Megasonic Frogboy, that make the biggest difference. While his friends offer their support, the Frogboy provides Ronitt with a hint as to how they might turn their fortunes around."
3,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_03","Back at Watts's Anvil, you are met by Ozogg, who had briefly disappeared in order to round up acquaintances of Ronitt's to assist with producing the tanks. Ronitt also has plans of his own, though he will wait until all of the pieces of the puzzle are in place before revealing exactly what those plans might be."
4,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_04","You are presented with an opportunity to flex your crafting muscles once more. Ronitt asks you to produce yet another crate of essential supplies while he and his comrades take care of the rest."
5,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_05","The Fetchomatic Mechatoad, infallible as always, produces from its metallic belly the materials required for your work. By your dexterous hands they will be reborn as essential components in...whatever it is that Ronitt's unfathomable genius has conjured up."
6,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_06","After a flurry of activity, Ronitt's latest creation is completed. He has incorporated his existing automaton technology into a mechanized factory, which he claims will increase the speed at which the remaining tanks may be produced. While this does raise the question of how exactly this was a more effective use of time and resources than simply repeating the steps used to create the prototype, it seems the general consensus is to go along with Ronitt's schemes, regardless of how absurd they may be.

The newly constructed automated factory whirs into life and the tanks approach completion. However, the day of reckoning has arrived, and it appears that Ronitt's efforts may have been too little, too late. Ozogg believes there is no other option but to delay the arrival of Chief Xamott to allow Ronitt time to finish his work before final judgment can be passed."
7,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_07","Ozogg intends to slow the advance of Chief Xamott by placing kegs of nitrobrew, a ludicrously potent alcoholic beverage, in his path. Knowing that dwarves cannot say no to a drink, she hopes that it will incapacitate him for long enough to allow Ronitt to put the finishing touches to the tanks. She tasks you with positioning the barrels, and while it is unclear why she needs your cooperation in the first place, time is of the essence, so you decide not to argue."
8,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_08","With the kegs of nitrobrew now in place, you must return to Ozogg's hiding place and await the arrival of Chief Xamott. With no idea of exactly when he is supposed to make his appearance, you may be here for some time."
9,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_09","Chief Xamott arrives as predicted, although he is for some reason accompanied by his archrival, Chief Glagg of the Gogg. Presumably, he has come expecting to see Ronitt fail the challenge and to admonish Ozogg for her involvement. Instead, they find themselves distracted by the allure of a powerful ale, prompting them to collapse into a drunken stupor. Though the limits of their dwarven constitution are sorely tested, they eventually awaken, and Ronitt is still nowhere to be seen. Xamott is ready to declare the wager has come to an end when Ronitt and his column of five tanks trundle onto the scene, much to the relief of you and Ozogg. Xamott congratulates Ronitt on passing the test, which he then uses as an opportunity to regale those in attendance with the tale of the great Watts.

It seems that the Tholl and Gogg were once part of the same tribe, and it was disputes over how best to use Watts's automata that caused the schism between them. His remaining designs were locked away, only for Ronitt to open the safe generations later using a coin given to him as a child by none other than Ozogg. This coming together of Tholl and Gogg may very well mark a turning point in the history of the two tribes, though only time will tell. Xamott and Glagg bid their farewells while the rest of you return to the Anvil."
10,"TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_10","The day is won, but Ronitt is not one to rest on his laurels. He knows full well that it will take more than five tanks to ease the world's woes, so he proposes that production continue. While the workshop is now fully outfitted with an automaton workforce, Ronitt still has need of your crafting talents in manufacturing the next batch of Rolling Tankards."
