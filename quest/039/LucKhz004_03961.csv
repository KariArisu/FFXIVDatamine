66,"TEXT_LUCKHZ004_03961_CATMISSIONARY_000_019","In any event, it is true.

67,"TEXT_LUCKHZ004_03961_CATMISSIONARY_000_020","Likewise, I would posit that those heavily layered silks are evidence that the gaelicat has adapted to its chilly surroundings.

71,"TEXT_LUCKHZ004_03961_CATMISSIONARY_000_024","Oh, but I can bear it no longer! I simply must behold the creature up close! I must embrace it, caress its fur, scratch behind its ears, nuzzle its nose and tell it over and over what a cute little kitty it is─yes, what a cute little kitty you are!"
