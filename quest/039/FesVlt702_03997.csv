Just before the Songbirds arrive to accept their fan letters, however, Astrid delivers a missive of her own─it seems that Lisette would take advantage of the close timing of Valentione's Day and Little Ladies' Day to host a joint event of some kind. It is then that Elyne suggests that the performers don Valentione-styled costumes, a proposal which is received enthusiastically by all involved.
