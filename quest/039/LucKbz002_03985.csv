1,"TEXT_LUCKBZ002_03985_SEQ_01","Cyella mentions she had been concerned that you had gone back to the Source for good, taking the crystals belonging to the First's Warriors of Light with you. She asks that you consider entrusting said crystals to her, that they might remain in the world those heroes fought so desperately to protect. As this is not a decision to be made lightly, you resolve to seek the input of their spiritual successors─the bounty hunters who helped to defeat the Cardinal Virtues─before committing."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBZ002_03985_SEQ_02","Giott is but a few steps away, indulging in her usual alcohol-related pastime, so you begin by asking for her input. She appears equal parts intimidated by the idea of deciding the fate of Lamitt's crystal and excited for the opportunity to make Lue-Reeq pay for her drinks, and so dashes off to collect him and Granson while you speak to Cerigg and Taynor."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBZ002_03985_SEQ_03","The group of bounty hunters assembled, you explain both Cyella's history and the possible reasons for entrusting her with the crystals. Though they are understandably surprised to hear that the erstwhile Shadowkeeper is nearby pouring ale, all agree that what remains of the First's Warriors of Light should remain in Norvrandt─and proceed to get astoundingly drunk. In the aftermath, you follow through on their sentiments by turning over the crystals to Cyella, who is moved to find that her former companions considered her a friend to the end, one and all."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBZ002_03985_SEQ_04","You find Cyella again once she has had a bit more time to process her emotions. She vows that she will continue to speak the truth of the Warriors of Light, so that their legacy may live on."
