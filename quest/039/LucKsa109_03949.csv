1,"TEXT_LUCKSA109_03949_SEQ_01","Mikoto and Misija have at last found a suitable source of aether to charge the crystal focus. Its extraction will prove to be a delicate process, which is why Mikoto insists that they accompany you to the site."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA109_03949_SEQ_02","You reach the extraction site only to find your two companions being assailed by Garlean soldiers. Weapon in hand, you rush in and give the imperials a terrible thrashing, forcing them to make a hasty retreat. The danger passed, you check to see if Mikoto and Misija are injured."
3,"TEXT_LUCKSA109_03949_SEQ_03","With the extraction device ready, Mikoto sets the crystal focus in place, patiently waiting for its reserves of aether to be restored. After a few moments, Misija removes the focus from the device, confusing Mikoto. Her confusion quickly turns to panic, however, when Misija draws a gun on her, ordering you to lower your weapon. Unwilling to risk Mikoto coming to harm, you do as you are told. In a flash, Misija and Mikoto are gone, along with the crystal focus."
4,"TEXT_LUCKSA109_03949_SEQ_04","You return to camp, alone and empty-handed, much to the dismay of Bajsaljen and the others. For lack of soldiers to pursue Misija and rescue Mikoto, Bajsaljen believes their best course of action is to proceed as planned and storm Castrum Lacus Litore."
5,"TEXT_LUCKSA109_03949_SEQ_05","Resistance scouts have yet to find any sign of Mikoto, but it is no reason to give up hope. When the castrum falls, Bajsaljen is hopeful Mikoto's rescue will follow shortly after."
