Aside from the introduction of Spanner into the works, it is much as you have done before─meaning that you will need to provide a substantial quantity of materials so that the necessary parts can be produced.

※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHT022_03983_SEQ_02","After much toil, you are finally able to present all of the delicate parts required to upgrade your tool to Emeny, who promptly rushes off to fetch her colleague. Neillemard's skills belie his nerves over carrying out the final augmentation, and at last you hold in your hands the culmination of all your efforts─a perfectly crafted skybuilders' tool, enhanced to the height of its power."
