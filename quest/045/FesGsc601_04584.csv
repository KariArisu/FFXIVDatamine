※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESGSC601_04584_SEQ_01","Ollier and his fellow attendants have been hard at work spreading the word across the realm of all the Gold Saucer has to offer, but it seems there is a rub─one of his colleagues has lost his confidence entirely, and the man refuses to admit that there is a problem. Ollier would have you inquire with the poor man as an impartial third party, and begs that you accompany him to Limsa Lominsa, where the individual in question is currently on assignment.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESGSC601_04584_SEQ_02","Speaking to Ollier upon your arrival in Limsa Lominsa, you learn that the dispirited colleague of whom he spoke is none other than Senor Sabotender─the Gold Saucer's star mascot and mood-maker. Whatever could be responsible for his uncharacteristic lack of motivation? All you can do is speak to the succulent staff member and inquire for yourself."
3,"TEXT_FESGSC601_04584_SEQ_03","You inquire with Senor Sabotender in hopes of gleaning the reason behind his recent malaise, but receive only a knowing gaze and beckoning arm in response. It would appear the Gold Saucer's mascot would prefer to discuss the matter out of the earshot of any potential eavesdroppers."
4,"TEXT_FESGSC601_04584_SEQ_04","As you survey your surroundings in search of Senor Sabotender, you are greeted instead by one Nanaphon─the young thespian inside the succulent green suit. The lad explains that while he has traveled with his colleagues here to Limsa in hopes of spreading the word about the Gold Saucer, he has found himself unable to sufficiently express the full extent of its wonders, as he has been sworn to a vow of silence so as to conceal Senor Sabotender's true identity. He rejoices when you offer to be his voice, and promises to share his finely honed sales pitch that you may contribute to the promotional effort."
5,"TEXT_FESGSC601_04584_SEQ_05","Fully enlightened by Nanaphon as to all the Saucer has to offer, you are now prepared to share the joy of Eorzea's foremost entertainment destination with the denizens of the city. You stride towards the Aftcastle ready to join Senor Sabotenor in your effort to reel in a host of new paying customers."
6,"TEXT_FESGSC601_04584_SEQ_06","At the Aftcastle, you are rejoined by Nanaphon, who once again has donned his Senor Sabotender suit and sealed his lips tight. Exchanging a determined glance with your succulent friend, you prepare to go forth into the city and give the sales pitch of your life."
7,"TEXT_FESGSC601_04584_SEQ_07","Through your earnest efforts, the residents of Limsa Lominsa now are well versed in the vast array of wonders that await them at the Manderville Gold Saucer. You prepare to reconvene with Senor Sabotender, in the hopes that your spiny companion is satisfied with your achievements."
8,"TEXT_FESGSC601_04584_SEQ_08","Though he speaks not a word, Senor Sabotender's intent gaze makes it clear that he is deeply appreciative of all you have done to help make his mission a success. Ollier, as well, arrives on the scene, announcing that all staff have been summoned back to the Saucer at once. Your work in Limsa Lominsa done, you are free to join them in the return voyage."
9,"TEXT_FESGSC601_04584_SEQ_09","Back at the Saucer, Ollier expresses his profound gratitude for having won over a plethora of new patrons for the establishment─some of whom it would seem have already made the trip. Senor Sabotender, for his part, welcomes the new guests in his inimitable style. Accepting a small token of thanks from the Saucer staff, you take your leave, satisfied that you have done right by your friends─smooth-skinned and prickly alike."
