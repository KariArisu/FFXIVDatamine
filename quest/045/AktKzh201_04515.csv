Maira and her brother Alkaios look set to leave on an errand of some kind."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SEQ_01","After asking if you've been to Anagnorisis, Maira suggests that you accompany her and Alkaios to meet with your acquaintance, Overseer Sokles. It seems the overseer has summoned the siblings to assist with what promises to be an intriguing duty...

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SEQ_02","Overseer Sokles explains that several creatures have fallen victim to rampaging lykaones. Alkaios, it seems, is often called upon to accelerate the decay of the remains with time magicks, and you have been invited to attend this somewhat solemn service in the southwest of Philomythes Notos."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SEQ_03","At the site of the fallen creations, the conversation turns to the subject of mourning and you share with the gathered ancients the traditions with which you are accustomed. Fascinated by the idea of leaving a physical reminder, Maira bids you follow her to a spot where she might prepare an offering of flowers for the deceased."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SEQ_04","Maira has manipulated the aether in the soil to produce a number of beautiful blooms. She bids you join her in picking a small bouquet for the service."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SEQ_05","Having gathered a small handful of Maira's conjured “krinoi,” you are ready to head back and deliver the offering to the waiting Sokles."
6,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SEQ_06","Sokles accepts your offering of flowers and places them with the remains. The simple gesture, alongside Alkaios's solemn words, appears to have stirred the hearts of those present. The Anagnorisis observers express their thanks for your contribution before sending you on your way back to Poieten Oikos."
7,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SEQ_07","Although perfectly normal to you, your ideas appear to be a source of great interest and inspiration to the long-lived observers. Again, you are forced to wonder if your presence here will affect how the future of the Source unfolds."

57,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_ALKAIOS_000_031","A summons from you can only mean one thing... There has been an incident?"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SOKLES_000_032","Yes, the lykaones went into a frenzy, and more than a few of our observational projects were prematurely ended."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SOKLES_000_033","We began the sending rites, of course, but the task is burdensome for so few. Thus did I hope to secure your particular expertise."

63,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SOKLES_000_037","That we do. Nevertheless, I do regret tearing you away from your important work. We've prepared a site to the southwest, so if you'll follow me, we can put this unpleasant business behind us in short order."

75,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_CHARMION_000_065","Nymeia lilies? A beautiful name for a flower, but not one I've heard of. I wonder if it was recently registered."
76,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_066","And you offer these lilies to the fallen... Interesting. We do have a custom of gifting flowers to those we love and admire, so I suppose this is not so different. Perhaps I can prepare some blooms to take the place of the ones you mentioned."
77,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_CHARMION_000_067","A physical reminder of the life that was? An interesting sentiment, but if we practiced such a custom in Elpis, we would eventually run out of places to put them."
78,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_068","I do like the idea of a tangible offering, though. Like a final gift for a friend. What about something organic which would decompose alongside the remains? Say, a bouquet of flowers?"

82,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SOKLES_000_088","I believe Maira will have some flowers for you to pick."
83,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_090","Here, I've made some flowers of our own. Even those fashioned directly of aether tend to sprout with more life and color when you grow them in the soil."
84,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_091","Pick yourself a handful, and we'll take them back to the overseer."
85,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_100","Aren't they lovely? They're called “krinoi”─one of my favorite flowers."
86,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_110","Hm? Oh, I'll be just fine by myself, but it's sweet of you to worry. I'll pick a few more of these krinoi, then join you in a little while."
87,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SOKLES_000_120","Maira's creations were acceptable, I trust?"
88,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_121","My apologies─I may have gotten a little carried away with the flowers."
89,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SOKLES_000_122","Not at all, Maira. Your effort is much appreciated."
90,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_SOKLES_000_123","Alkaios, if you would be so kind...?"
91,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_ALKAIOS_000_124","Vessels within which life once flowed; cheated of purpose, stilled and cold. Unto the land you now return, the fuel 'pon which new life shall burn."
92,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_125","That was a beautiful service. I like to think it brought some joy to their departed souls, much as one feels when receiving a thoughtful gift."
93,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_CHARMION_000_126","Yes, the flowers were the perfect addition. How fortunate we are to have this knowledgeable familiar in our midst!"

102,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_150","What a fortuitous turn of events that you were present when we received the summons to Anagnorisis."
103,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_151","As time marches on, we encounter fewer and fewer of these truly new experiences..."
104,"TEXT_AKTKZH201_04515_MAIRA_000_152","Yet ever since you appeared, it's been one surprise after another. I suppose we should expect nothing less from one of Azem's creations."
