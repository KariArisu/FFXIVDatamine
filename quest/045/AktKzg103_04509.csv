Charmion prepares to launch into another lecture on life on Anagnorisis."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_SEQ_01","Charmion begins explaining how the observers of Anagnorisis approach rest and recuperation, when she realizes that she hasn't inquired about your nutritional requirements. The suddenly panicked ancient sets her lecture aside, sending you west of the Mourning Dew to gather a handful of Archestratus flowers while she rushes off to make urgent culinary preparations.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."

3,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_SEQ_03","You deliver the blooms to Overseer Sokles, who combines them with Charmion's handpicked fruits to create a tasty looking juice medley. He hands you the aether-rich beverage, and urges you to drink it on the spot."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_SEQ_04","You drink down the proffered juice, marveling at the complexity of its fruity and floral flavors. Charmion hovers nearby, obviously in need of reassurance that you won't suddenly fade into nothingness..."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_SEQ_05","Satisfied that your corporeal form is no longer in danger of imminent dissipation, Charmion continues her lecture on the importance of proper nourishment and the evils of overindulgence. It seems your educational exchange with the passionate observers of Anagnorisis is set to continue..."

53,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_CHARMION_000_005","Would you mind picking some of the white blooms to the west of here and bringing them to Overseer Sokles? “Archestratus flowers,” we call them. I'll have everything else ready by the time you arrive!"
54,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_CHARMION_000_010","Archestratus flowers are an edible bloom, you see. Hand them to Overseer Sokles, and he'll mix them with the fruits I gathered to make a delicious juice!"
55,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_SOKLES_000_015","Charmion explained to me the “crisis” at hand. We cannot let you wither for lack of aether now, can we?"

65,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_SOKLES_000_042","And now that we know you won't suddenly vanish, will you please reassure Charmion? She still looks terribly concerned."

69,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_CHARMION_000_051","Still, I firmly believe that the consumption of food should be limited to restoring one's strength. Any reason beyond that is simply wasteful."
70,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_CHARMION_000_052","Eating for enjoyment alone is an unnecessary drain on living resources, and such a practice can only be harmful to our star's equilibrium."
71,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_CHARMION_000_053","Which is why I have so much respect for Overseer Sokles and his culinary talent─he employs ingredients and methods which not only optimize a dish's aetherial concentration, but also produce flavorful results."
72,"TEXT_AKTKZG103_04509_SOKLES_000_054","Save your compliments, Charmion. I won't be flattered into making another batch until it's time for our next meal."
