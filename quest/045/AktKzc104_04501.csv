Rimelnaud has precisely one solution in mind, which is notably better than zero."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZC104_04501_SEQ_01","Rimelnaud proposes that to circumvent the issue of needing an identification key, he and Appius reconfigure the rig's control mechanisms to operate without one. He returns to camp to gather the equipment and men needed to do so while Appius gets to work on the necessary rewiring. Meanwhile, you are tasked with slaying any particularly fearsome creatures in the vicinity, that the engineers not be accosted.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZC104_04501_SEQ_02","You summarily execute two nearby monsters, which seems good enough. It is, after all, freezing out here."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZC104_04501_SEQ_03","When you return to Appius, it transpires that he has finished his preparations─and rather enjoyed watching your battle from afar. Rimelnaud then returns with the necessary power sources, which members of the contingent attach to the facility. Soon enough, Juturna Platform G roars back to life with Appius at the helm."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZC104_04501_SEQ_04","With the rig now confirmed operational, Rimelnaud suggests the three of you head back to camp to inform Esdelot of your roaring success."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZC104_04501_SEQ_05","Esdelot is delighted to hear of your achievements, and extends his gratitude for all you have done, as do the others. Thanks to you, Appius and Rimelnaud now dare to dream of the ways in which the newly recovered ceruleum supply will help the region and its people on their road to recovery."

78,"TEXT_AKTKZC104_04501_ESDELOT_000_061","...And it seems I won't have any longer to wait. I trust your eagerness is a sign that you had some success?"
79,"TEXT_AKTKZC104_04501_RIMELNAUD_000_062","Yes, sir! We were able to access the platform's controls and confirm that it is operational. There are still adjustments to be made, but I imagine it won't be long until it's fully operational."
