※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANARK003_04547_SEQ_01","The Hippo Riders' food delivery service is an instant success, which is phenomenal for their coffers, but hard on their hippos. Trna is expressing her concern over her hippos' health when she is interrupted by her frantic associate Ghasa, who was accosted by an armor-clad bandit and robbed of the meals he was delivering. After sending Ghasa out to redeliver the order, Trna asks you to accompany her to the Shroud of the Samgha in search of this mysterious food thief.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANARK003_04547_SEQ_02","The bandit has long since evanesced, as bandits are wont to do. Undeterred, you, Trna, and a decidedly sluggish Saurya search the area for clues of his whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_BANARK003_04547_SEQ_03","Instead of a bandit, you find two adorable hippo calves! Without any adult hippos present, they are in danger of falling prey to other wildlife, so you attempt to persuade them to follow you."
4,"TEXT_BANARK003_04547_SEQ_04","Relying on your superior skill in hippo linguistics─and the robust odor of hippo about your person─you manage to convince the calves to follow you. Together, you set off for the last known location of Trna, who will hopefully know how to handle this situation.

※You must be accompanied by the hippo calves to complete this task. Speak with them again should you become separated."
5,"TEXT_BANARK003_04547_SEQ_05","Trna is surprised by your adorable escorts, but admits she found no trace of the bandit either. She suggests heading to Palaka's Stand with the calves for the time being, where she expects to find Ghasa redelivering his order."
6,"TEXT_BANARK003_04547_SEQ_06","Ghasa is handing over the meal order when you arrive, and who should be accepting it but Ogul and Racashir! After squeaking a little at the mention of an armor-clad Arkasodara, Ogul assures you she will be on the lookout for nefarious characters. Ghasa heads for the watering holes up north in search of the calves' origins, while advising Trna to take them into her custody at Svarna."
7,"TEXT_BANARK003_04547_SEQ_07","Ghasa's findings implicate an unsavory Matanga in the hippo calves' abandonment by their herd, but while this information aligns with the profile of the grub-grabber from earlier, the trail has unfortunately grown cold. Anticipating the possibility of being accosted once more ere the case of the would-be hippo-napper can be solved, Maru and Ghasa team up to install comfortable stables and a modest wading pool in Svarna. The mysterious bandit may still be at large, but the Riders' hardworking hippos will now be well rested, relaxed, and ready to take on whatever challenges await them!"
