1,"TEXT_AKTKBZ004_04582_SEQ_01","Thinking on Nero's words from earlier, Fourchenault does not wish to waste time before striking the Tower of Babil. He asks you join him back at Camp Broken Glass to reconvene with the others and prepare."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBZ004_04582_SEQ_02","You return to Camp Broken Glass where Raubahn and Hien have also arrived to assist with the assault on the tower. Soon after, Kan-E-Senna is contacted by Lorens with glad tidings─Varis's heart has been reclaimed, meaning the barrier protecting the blasphemy will soon be no more. She goes on to say that Merlwyb and Aymeric will await you at the tower's entrance, and so you make to leave. But not before Nero─and more surprisingly, Fourchenault─voice a desire to join you."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBZ004_04582_SEQ_03","Your party thus assembled, you brace yourselves and enter the Tower of Babil."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBZ004_04582_SEQ_04","After an arduous climb, you and your allies at last find yourselves face-to-face with the blasphemy born of Nerva's despair. A grueling battle ensues, but in the end, he proves no match for your combined strength. With the path to the moon now open, and the lands of Ilsabard now safe from the spire's aether-draining effects, you return back to camp victorious."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBZ004_04582_SEQ_05","Fourchenault and the refugees thank you for all your help, though Nero finds their praise unnecessary. Word of your victory soon reaches the ears of Livingway, who appears equal parts excited and terrified to finally have people living on the moon. Before they depart, Fourchenault asks you to return to Radz-at-Han, and inform Shirabaht of the blasphemy's defeat."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBZ004_04582_SEQ_06","Shirabaht is gladdened to hear the blasphemy is no more, though hardly surprised knowing you had a hand in vanquishing it. With no other outstanding reports of blasphemy sightings, she dares to hope Nerva was indeed the last. Perhaps now the scars of the Final Days can finally begin to heal."
