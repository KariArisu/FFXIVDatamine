1,"TEXT_STMBDR602_04587_SEQ_01","Omega expresses a desire to understand the seemingly illogical relationship between the Ilsabard contingent and the imperial population. In order to explore this inconsistency, it bids you teleport your group to Camp Broken Glass in Garlemald."
2,"TEXT_STMBDR602_04587_SEQ_02","Your demanding mechanical companion insists that understanding its current issue will require questioning a representative of both the contingent and the Empire. With the implacable Omega and the shivering Alpha in tow, you set off to find some suitable interviewees.

3,"TEXT_STMBDR602_04587_SEQ_03","The men you question both remember you from an earlier visit, although with distinctly different emotions. Both, however, react to Omega's assessments in similarly unexpected fashion, providing the confused machine with a bounty of data to analyze.

Manius introduces himself, and Omega immediately subjects him to a barrage of probing questions.

7,"TEXT_STMBDR602_04587_SEQ_07","Satisfied that no further revelations are forthcoming from Camp Broken Glass, Omega indicates its readiness to proceed to its third and final query. This last issue concerns the dearth of information regarding the ancients, and what their full impact on the Final Days might have been. Omega determines that the moon-dwelling Loporrits represent the best source of additional data, and your teleportation spell soon has you materializing inside Bestways Burrow."
8,"TEXT_STMBDR602_04587_SEQ_08","In a stroke of good fortune, Omega's need for observational assistance is immediately filled by the appearance of an enthusiastic Growingway. They set off to examine the burrow's technology, and Omega returns from his Loporrit-guided tour with further questions about the ancients' near-ideal society. The ever-inquisitive machine now wishes to speak with “the watcher,” and agrees to your suggestion to ride Argos to the entity's tower."

The tales you share only serve to confound Omega further, however, as it struggles to reconcile its objective assessment of events with your highly personal perspective. The oft-beeping model nevertheless accepts the data which you and the watcher have provided, and states that its investigation is now completed. The time has come to make a return to Thaumazein."
11,"TEXT_STMBDR602_04587_SEQ_11","Barely have Biggs and Wedge welcomed you back to Sharlayan when they explain that an urgent matter calls them away. You accompany them to their waiting airship, with Omega sharing the results of its investigations while you walk. Omega concludes that Sir's illogical actions strongly indicate the presence of a “heart,” which it has now defined as “a phenomenon which influences one's interpretation of reality.”

Upon arriving at the vessel, Biggs presses Omega to hold up its part of the bargain, and it finally provides you with a translation of the mystery transmission. It is a simple message, of hope and shared joy, the spiritual value of which appears lost on the ever-practical Omicron."
12,"TEXT_STMBDR602_04587_SEQ_12","With the investigation over and its promised duty discharged, Omega returns to traveling the star with Alpha. Sharlayan, Radz–at–Han, Garlemald─the wide world and its many peoples await. There are questions yet to be answered, and the road ahead is long..."
