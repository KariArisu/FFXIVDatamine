Sokles continues to regard you with a fiery curiosity."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_SEQ_01","Sokles and Charmion are eager to explore your “unique” perspective on the world. Follow Charmion to the south side of Anagnorisis and deepen your mutual understanding.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_SEQ_02","You behold the majestic “bird of Elpis” and are pressed to voice your initial reaction. Charmion, seemingly fascinated by your every word, leads you further southward to another engaging sight and engrossing discussion."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_SEQ_03","Charmion points out a distant island, and explains the work of some “unorthodox” researchers. Your response appears to prompt a moment of self-realization. Seeking a moment to rest and reflect, Charmion continues onward to the tranquil garden of the Mourning Dew."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_SEQ_04","In stark contrast to the calming influence of your surrounds, Charmion is relentless in her questioning. Seemingly satisfied by your answers, however, she at last allows you to sit back and enjoy the promised serenity. For a while, at least."

49,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_SOKLES_000_001","What is it about you that ignites my observer's soul? Well, now that we've been properly introduced, perhaps you can tell us more?"
50,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_002","Yes, I would very much like to know how you see the world; how everything, large or small, appears to your eyes."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_SOKLES_000_003","Assuming you are amenable to the idea, you must join Charmion on another tour─this time to take a wider look at the surrounding facilities."

56,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_SOKLES_000_005","Hah! A familiar concerned with the passage of time? Marvelous. You truly are a rare treasure."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_006","...But where to begin? Which facility do you suggest, Overseer?"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_SOKLES_000_007","Hm? Oh, any place you feel will best elicit a response from our guest."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_008","R-Right! Yes! Of course..."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_009","Well then, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─come with me and we'll visit the arcane entities on the south side of Anagnorisis."

62,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_025","You have an intriguing presence, to say the least! Please, stay awhile, and share more of your thoughts with us."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_030","We have yet to register an official name for this specimen, so we simply call it the “bird of Elpis.” What is your first thought upon beholding this majestic creature?"
64,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_Q2_000_000","What is your first thought?"
65,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_A2_000_001","That I want to ride it into the sky."
66,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_A2_000_002","That I want to fight it."
67,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_A2_000_003","That I've seen it somewhere before..."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_031","Fascinating... Imagine a familiar which supplements its deficiencies by taking a mount with the desired capability─in this case, flight!"
69,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_032","Oh, are you equipped for battle as well!? That...that would explain the weaponry."
70,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_033","You have? But...we haven't even completed its evaluation, let alone registered a concept with the Bureau of the Architect. Are you perhaps acquainted with the entity's creator?"
71,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_034","In any case, I am eager to hear more of your responses. You truly are unlike any construct I have ever met, familiar or otherwise."
72,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_035","Let's continue southwards, shall we? I would like to hear your opinion on this next facility."
73,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_040","That structure over yonder houses some of our more “unorthodox” researchers. Rather than weave creation magicks, they breed existing specimens in the hopes of begetting new strains and species."
74,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_041","The method is imprecise; the outcome uncertain. To my eyes, such research seems awfully self-indulgent─merely a means to sate the whims of one's intellectual curiosity."
75,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_042","Our purpose in life is to <Emphasis>improve</Emphasis> Etheirys. In my opinion, we should steer clear of techniques which produce flawed results."
76,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_Q3_000_000","What will you say?"
77,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_A3_000_001","You have no use for “flawed” creations?"
78,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_A3_000_002","What if the process created something unexpectedly incredible─beyond what you could imagine?"
79,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_A3_000_003","Your perspective is strange to me."
80,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_043","And that bothers you? Are you concerned you'll be evaluated and found wanting? I never considered it that way..."
81,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_044","A serendipitous discovery? I suppose it <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> possible..."
82,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_045","Yes, I suppose it would be. Just as the perspective of those researchers is strange to me... Perhaps I was too hasty in my judgment."
83,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_046","Thank you. I had thought to broaden your horizons, and here I am realizing how narrow my own views can be─hardly a desirable quality in an observer."
84,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_047","Time for a spot of rest and reflection, I say. Shall we move on to the Mourning Dew? It's favored by many an observer for its calming tranquility."
85,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_050","Welcome to our garden of respite! We can explore more of it later, but first..."
86,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_051","I want to hear more of what you think. Of people. Of us."
87,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_052","I've often sat here, musing upon the nature of our creations, and wondered how a familiar might perceive its creator."
88,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_Q4_000_000","What will you say?"
89,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_A4_000_001","You are as deities."
90,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_A4_000_002","We are not so different."
91,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_A4_000_003","I don't understand you at all."
92,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_053","Deities? Ah, one of those metaphorically “omnipotent beings” the debaters dream up for their arguments. I'm surprised you know the word..."
93,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_054","Hah! Perhaps that's true! You do seem far closer to us in nature than most other familiars."
94,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_055","Hm, I don't suppose you do. It's a complex matter, and I invite you to ask more questions should you wish to investigate the idea more thoroughly."
95,"TEXT_AKTKZG102_04508_CHARMION_000_056","Well, let us set aside such musings for a moment, and bask in the Mourning Dew's serenity!"
