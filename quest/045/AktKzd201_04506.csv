Vipsania is worried for her beloved."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_SEQ_01","Having successfully reunited Volusus with his mother, you turn your attention to locating his missing father. According to Vipsania, he is none other than the chief of Juturna Platform G, and colleague of Appius the engineer. As your group was planning to travel to Camp Broken Glass, this would be the perfect opportunity to glean information on the husband's whereabouts from your Garlean acquaintance.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_SEQ_02","Appius confirms that Chief Frontinus and Vipsania's husband are one and the same, and that he and his identification key have yet to be located. Upon deducing that he most likely headed to the Enceladeum, Galla asks you to go with her and Rimelnaud to search for the missing engineer."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_SEQ_03","After arriving at the Enceladeum, Galla asks you to search within the perimeter walls for Frontinus, while she and Rimelnaud try the nearby buildings. With deadly magitek patrolling the vicinity, you would do well to avoid detection."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_SEQ_04","During your search, you hear a scream in the distance. Fearing the worst, you race off in the direction of the commotion, prepared to take down any drones that might bar your way."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_SEQ_05","You discover the injured Frontinus facing down an enormous magitek monstrosity, which you dispatch with little difficulty. The silver-haired Garlean, however, is gravely wounded, and you rush to his aid."
6,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_SEQ_06","Frontinus catches his breath and thanks you for sparing him an untimely demise. Galla and Rimelnaud bid you go on ahead to deliver the good news, while they help Frontinus make the long journey to Camp Broken Glass."
7,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_SEQ_07","After what must seem an eternity, Frontinus is reunited with his wife and son. He also reveals that he had planned to shut off the supply of ceruleum to the magitek drones using his identification key, thereby disabling them, only for his attempt to end in abject failure. Nevertheless, he lives to tell the tale, and his family could not be more delighted. The three of them will stay at Camp Broken Glass for the time being, where Frontinus will lend his unique talents to the restoration of the city."

70,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_GALLA_000_027","Useful information, to be sure, but we'll need more than that before we can go looking for him. Volusus, could you tell us anything else about your father?"

73,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_VIPSANIA_000_030","My husband is also a dyed-in-the-wool patriot. He made a point of hanging the imperial flag in front of our house for all the neighborhood to see, and often spoke of his devotion to the Empire."
74,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_APPIUS_000_031","We have a lot in common, the chief and I. I'm certain he only took the key to stop others from misusing the platform."

84,"TEXT_AKTKZD201_04506_APPIUS_000_039","That's it! He could use the key to halt the supply of ceruleum to the magitek drones. Deprived of fuel, most of them would be rendered entirely inoperable!"
