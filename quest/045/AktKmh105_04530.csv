75,"TEXT_AKTKMH105_04530_VARSHAHN_000_136","Indeed, which is why I saw it sealed with an alchemically forged lock and warded it with my magicks. Such power must not fall into the wrong hands."

83,"TEXT_AKTKMH105_04530_VARSHAHN_000_144","Thanks to my brilliant alchemists. I should have destroyed the anomaly when I found it, but instead, I bade them devise a means to control it."
84,"TEXT_AKTKMH105_04530_VARSHAHN_000_145","After much experimentation, they accomplished the impossible. A method was conceived by which my magicks could manipulate the fissure and transform it into a serviceable gate."
85,"TEXT_AKTKMH105_04530_VARSHAHN_000_146","But the process has long since been forgotten. Once I had given up searching for Azdaja, there was no need to preserve such esoteric and dangerous knowledge."

87,"TEXT_AKTKMH105_04530_GRAHATIA_000_148","Our own passage to the Thirteenth was made relatively simple thanks to the Crystal Tower."
88,"TEXT_AKTKMH105_04530_GRAHATIA_000_149","An ancient mechanism channeled the tower's vast stores of energy to open a voidgate─one bound to a covenant made with the Cloud of Darkness."

92,"TEXT_AKTKMH105_04530_YSHTOLA_000_153","In any case, we should attempt to gain an understanding of the Bounty gate. Mayhap you could resume the search for your sister..."
