1,"TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_SEQ_01","Anticipation plain in his voice, Varshahn informs you that both the reinforced warding scales and the artificial Atomos have been completed. Assuming they function as intended, all is now in readiness for your quest to find Azdaja, his sister, in the Thirteenth. Thus do you set off to join your comrades at the Great Work."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_SEQ_02","You take stock of the items needed for your journey, and, by way of a surprise, Varshahn is presented with a new vessel better suited for the dangers ahead. You, too, are given a gift of sorts in the form of Hydaelyn's navigational crystal; harboring the power of Light, the relic could well aid you in your mission. With nothing left to discuss, you make your way to Akyaali, where your boat awaits."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_SEQ_03","The boat bears you to Alzadaal's Legacy, and you descend into the chamber of the voidgate. There, all gathered watch on with bated breath as Varshahn steps forward to lift the seal.

※In the event that you leave Weaver's Warding, you may re-enter by speaking with the veteran Radiant in Akyaali."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_SEQ_04","In the name of Alzadaal III, the voidgate is revealed, and thence enlarged by the Atomos to a size able to accommodate a man. At last, the way is open. Beyond lies a castle swarming with voidsent, and your first task upon arriving will be to deal with any hostile entities.

※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_SEQ_05","After hurtling through the emptiness of the rift, you emerge in the bowels of the forewarned castle. Its occupants are hells-bent on devouring your aether, and you must fight them off lest your quest come to a premature end.

※In the event that you leave Troia Castle, you may return via Weaver's Warding."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_SEQ_06","The battle takes an unexpected turn when the castle's mistress is devoured by a fearsome voidsent named Scarmiglione, but your fellow uninvited guest soon falls by your hand. With the area secured, you and your comrades discuss the next course of action."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_SEQ_07","In your brief time in the Thirteenth, you have been made keenly aware how little you know about voidsent. If you are to survive their world, you must learn their ways."
