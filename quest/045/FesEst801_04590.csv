※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST801_04590_SEQ_01","After wishing you a very happy Hatching–tide and sharing with you the details of her latest vision, Jihli Aliapoh wastes no time in enlisting your services to deal with a most pressing concern that threatens to interfere with this year's festivities. To wit, she would ask you to make haste to the Greatloam Growery and do what you can to procure eggs from Master Pawlin's flock of fine chickens─a task which has proved an unexpected challenge thus far. You set out for the farm in hopes of seeking out one Nonotta─a friend of Jihli's who will provide further enlightenment as to the task required of you.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

At Jihli's dear friend's behest, you agree to search for the creatures, in the hopes that this year's Hatching–tide festivities might resemble those foretold."
3,"TEXT_FESEST801_04590_SEQ_03","Following the trail of your quarry, you learn that the rabbits and chickens ran off in the direction of New Gridania. You resolve to head there and see if there are any leads to be had."

5,"TEXT_FESEST801_04590_SEQ_05","Putting your keen hunting skills to good use, you manage to round up the entire menagerie of runaway critters. With a sigh of relief, you resolve to make for the city and report to Jihli Aliapoh, who will no doubt be tickled pink to hear of your success."
6,"TEXT_FESEST801_04590_SEQ_06","Back in town, Jihli offers her profuse thanks for your efforts, further explaining that the chickens have settled down and appear ready and willing to offer their eggs to you in abundance. Hatching–tide can now go off without a hitch! Nonotta offers to finish decorating the eggs so that you and your newfound friends may take to the streets and distribute them just as Jihli envisioned in her dreams─and with any luck, bring good fortune to one and all in the process."
7,"TEXT_FESEST801_04590_SEQ_07","With assistance from newfound friends both feathered and floppy-eared, you have completed the task of handing out decorative eggs to a host of appreciative Gridanians.

8,"TEXT_FESEST801_04590_SEQ_08","Jihli Aliapoh rejoices at your return, offering her profuse gratitude for your efforts in saving this year's Hatching–tide from the brink of disaster.

You are now free to enjoy the Hatching–tide festivities to your heart's content, or continue to assist the Dreamers in giving the gift of eggs should you so desire."
