50,"TEXT_BANARK101_04551_MARU_000_003","Tell folks that if they bring back one of these, they'll get a discount. That sounds professional, right? Anyhow, I'll leave the talkin' to you─I know you'll explain it good."

52,"TEXT_BANARK101_04551_DOCKER04551_000_011","A start-up delivery service...by hippo cart? And here I thought chocobo carriages were the only viable option. What an intriguing angle."

56,"TEXT_BANARK101_04551_DOCKER04551_000_015","I'll be sure to pass this along."

58,"TEXT_BANARK101_04551_TRADERWOMAN04551_000_017","A delivery service! By hippo cart, no less. This is perfect timing─it just so happens that I need a parcel delivered to the Giantsgall Grounds without delay."

66,"TEXT_BANARK101_04551_THINKINGARKASODARA04551_000_025","Of course, I'll be needing it shipped back now, so could I trouble you for another handbill? Oh, and some extras for my friends!"
