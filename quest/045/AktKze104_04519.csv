Dreamingway has one last demonstration for you."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZE104_04519_SEQ_01","Still determined to discover a dream worthy of pursuit, Dreamingway wishes to show you how the Loporrits grow carrots─by having you try it yourself. To begin, he asks that you bring a handful of seeds to the carrot creation station nearby.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZE104_04519_SEQ_02","You somewhat unceremoniously load the seeds into the carrot creation station, impressing Dreamingway nevertheless. He explains that the next step towards a bountiful harvest requires water crystals, which can be had from the sparkling supply station in the northeast corner of the Carrotorium."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZE104_04519_SEQ_03","You find a large store of crystals exactly where Dreamingway said they would be. With crate in hand, you make your perilous journey over ramp and oversized stairway to arrive at a nearby carrot creation station."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZE104_04519_SEQ_04","Once the crystals are deposited into the machine, all one needs do is wait for the carrots to grow. Fortuitously, after mere moments, Dreamingway hears a sound─undetectable to your ears─that indicates carrots elsewhere in the Carrotorium are ready for picking."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZE104_04519_SEQ_05","You visit the surrounding creation stations and, surely enough, find two carrots practically begging to be plucked. After freeing them with satisfying tugs, you tuck them into your bag that you might present them to Dreamingway."
6,"TEXT_AKTKZE104_04519_SEQ_06","Dreamingway commends you on a job well done, though sadly, your success only reaffirms his belief that he is an unremarkable Loporrit. Mention of his exceptional hearing, however, gives you an idea, and so you ask if he has ever considered musical pursuits. After a brief explanation of what music is, he hums a melody together with his companion Knockingway. Both find it to be a heartwarming experience, and thus is Dreamingway inspired to share the gift of music with anyone and everyone─a dream of his very own."
7,"TEXT_AKTKZE104_04519_SEQ_07","Knockingway thanks you for solving Dreamingway's problem as only a person of Etheirys can. Similarly, the newly motivated Loporrit promises to practice his music often, hopeful that he will have a new tune to play for you when next you meet."

49,"TEXT_AKTKZE104_04519_DREAMINGWAY_000_001","...Not that there's a lot to it, truth be told. We simply place the seeds in the machine, water them, and then reap the sweet rewards."
