49,"TEXT_BANARK109_04559_MARU_000_001","He's a tough bloke, so I didn't think twice about sendin' him off to pummel valras─but now I'm worried somethin' might've happened."
50,"TEXT_BANARK109_04559_MARU_000_002","I reckon you're even tougher than he is, so would you mind seekin' him out? He should be on the Perfumed Rise somewhere─an' hopefully he ain't dismantled."

55,"TEXT_BANARK109_04559_MARU_000_021","Of course he did... He's usually a sober-minded fellow, but all bets are off when a little critter gets involved."
56,"TEXT_BANARK109_04559_MARU_000_022","Anyway, I'm relieved to hear he's alright. Wasn't sure what I was gonna do if he wasn't..."
