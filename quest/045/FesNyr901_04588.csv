※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESNYR901_04588_SEQ_01","This Heavensturn, the usagi bugyo, a member of a Far Eastern delegation come from Hingashi, is eager to introduce the good people of Eorzea to a tradition sure to change their fortune for the better. Eyeing you carefully, he ascertains that you are an adventurer, and mentions a request he would make of you. Dangling the opportunity to acquire your very own set of Far Eastern armor before you, he bids you speak with his colleague, an omikujishi standing near the Tempest Gate.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESNYR901_04588_SEQ_02","As you approach the Far Eastern omikujishi, you find him with a dismayed expression on his face, and soon learn that he has experienced difficulty in getting the townspeople to take an interest in omikuji, a form of fortune-telling native to the Far East. Never one to turn down a soul in need─and with a set of your very own yoroi on the line─you agree to assist him by spreading word of the attraction to any who will listen on the upper decks of Limsa Lominsa."
3,"TEXT_FESNYR901_04588_SEQ_03","From the Drowning Wench to the Missing Member, you have spread word of the fortune-telling spectacle to people from all walks of life, including a storm lieutenant of the Maelstrom, and even the pirate captain of the Sanguine Sirens herself. You can only hope that enough folk were enticed by your words to give the omikujishi the audience he deserves."
4,"TEXT_FESNYR901_04588_SEQ_04","Upon returning to the omikujishi, he thanks you for your assistance, and asks that you remain at his side to see the fruits of your labor. As the townspeople amass and read their fortunes, you observe reactions both of glee and despair. Should you find yourself with a moment to spare, there may be another matter you can assist the omikujishi with."

63,"TEXT_FESNYR901_04588_OMIKUJISHI_000_015","A form of fortune-telling, omikuji may be translated as “sacred lots” in your tongue. One receives a lot at random, and with it a message from the divine upon a piece of parchment."
