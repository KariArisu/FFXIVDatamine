49,"TEXT_BANARK121_04571_MARU_000_001","But then Kancana told me that your adventures've tossed you into the maw of death an' back again. I figure handlin' some explosives is child's play compared to that...right?"
50,"TEXT_BANARK121_04571_MARU_000_002","...Well, you're still here, so I'll take that as a sign of tacit agreement. We need someone to break up the mudstone around Ksiroda an' bring back a piece. The alchemists keep tellin' me this is the best way, but...just mind your fingers, alright?"
51,"TEXT_BANARK121_04571_MARU_000_010","There you are─an' with fingers an' toes still attached! I take it that means the alchemists were right after all."

54,"TEXT_BANARK121_04571_MARU_000_013","Sure, maybe you could've just broken up the stone with a hammer an' chisel...but now I don't gotta worry about someone accidentally settin' those demolishers alight an' blowin' us all into the next life, neither."
