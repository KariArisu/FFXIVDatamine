1,"TEXT_AKTKEA104_04539_SEQ_01","Speaking plain, Deryk confesses that he isn't fond of working one-on-one with another, but he will dutifully do what is requested of him. Thus do you set forth─separately─for Arrzaneth Ossuary in Ul'dah, there to investigate the worship of Nald'thal."
2,"TEXT_AKTKEA104_04539_SEQ_02","Joining Deryk at the Ossuary, you establish that though the Nald'thal you encountered differs somewhat in appearance from the twins revered by Ul'dahns, they still share many similarities. However, Deryk's blithe mentioning of your recent activities begins to attract the attention of the pious folk nearby, and upon being alerted to their dismay, he sheepishly takes himself outside."
3,"TEXT_AKTKEA104_04539_SEQ_03","Deryk declares that your work in Ul'dah is done. Rather than wait for G'raha Tia to arrive, however, he suggests seeking your companion out at the Sunken Temple of Qarn, and you begin making your way to the ruins in southern Thanalan.  "
4,"TEXT_AKTKEA104_04539_SEQ_04","You arrive at the temple to find Deryk tending to a collapsed woman, by whose attire he posits is a scholar. She begs you to bring food and water from her bag, and you go to search for it in the area."
5,"TEXT_AKTKEA104_04539_SEQ_05","You soon come upon what appears to be the scholar's bag, but find only a skin with a meager amount of water inside. Though you doubt it will be enough, for now you decide to take the water to the woman."
6,"TEXT_AKTKEA104_04539_SEQ_06","As expected, the water doesn't suffice, and the woman begs for food. Before you can offer something, however, G'raha Tia arrives on the scene. After his initial shock at your presence, he turns his attention to the woman, one Snoegeim, who promptly springs back to life thanks to his gift of nutritious provender. Introduced as the mythologist Krile recruited, Snoegeim can barely contain her excitement as she hears your account of the phantom realm, and identifies similarities between the domains you visited and the heavens of legend. Having thus successfully rendezvoused with your new colleague, you make your way to join Krile in the Omphalos."
7,"TEXT_AKTKEA104_04539_SEQ_07","Upon arriving in the Omphalos, Snoegeim immediately begins making excited observations of the isle, which she believes to be the seventh heaven. Your party then reviews all that you have learned thus far and discuss a potential course, before taking a well-earned rest at the most fitting of venues─the Seventh Heaven in Mor Dhona─where you manage to catch a glimpse of Deryk with his guard down. Afterwards, your group disperses for a time, with the solitary explorer opting to go for a walk nearby. For want of an immediate task of your own, you decide to look in on him."
8,"TEXT_AKTKEA104_04539_SEQ_08","Deryk informs you that he intends to remain in Revenant's Toll while awaiting developments, and promises to share any tidings with you. Though you know not when, it's only a matter of time before your investigation resumes, and you look forward to drawing closer to solving the mystery of the Twelve."
