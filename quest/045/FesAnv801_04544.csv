※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_01","Making your way through the Ruby Road Exchange during the Rising, you encounter the wandering minstrel, who asks you to take a fledgling adventurer under your wing. Thus do you make your way to the Gate of Nald, there to await a soul who has just embarked upon the path of adventure.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_02","It doesn't take long for an aspiring adventurer to wander through the gate, nor for you to identify him. You approach the bright-eyed lad, who introduces himself as Nhagi'a Jakkya. He gratefully accepts your offer of help, and heads to the Quicksand to register with the Adventurers' Guild, as you yourself once did."
3,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_03","With the stroke of a pen and a few words of encouragement from Momodi, Nhagi'a's registration is complete. In view of your experience, the Quicksand proprietress then tasks you with giving the lad the grand tour, beginning with recommending a guild in Ul'dah to join."
4,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_04","Your sage advice helps Nhagi'a to settle on a guild. Wasting no time, he rushes off to add his name to its roll, but not before requesting to meet again afterwards. When the lad doesn't return after a good while, you decide to look in on him at the guild."
5,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_05","To your relief, you find Nhagi'a more than holding his own. After apologizing for keeping you waiting, he informs you that a peculiar minstrel had approached him with a task, and bade him come to the Ruby Road Exchange to speak further. Curiously, your own presence is also requested, and you make your way to see the client together."
6,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_06","As you had suspected, the client turns out to be the wandering minstrel. The man reveals that, in seeking inspiration for his next composition, he contrived to bring you and Nhagi'a together─an adventurer old and an adventurer new─in a reminder that the present owes its existence to the past. Having thus established his vision, the minstrel then asks each of you to bring him an object with a connection to the Calamity, the event which gave rise to the realm's rebirth. Excited for his first-ever task as an adventurer, Nhagi'a suggests taking your search to the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, where many vendors peddle their wares."
7,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_07","You join Nhagi'a at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, and together begin looking for your objects.

※You must be accompanied by Nhagi'a Jakkya to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
8,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_08","You have visited a number of vendors and found promising wares for your purposes. Believing you've seen enough, Nhagi'a suggests heading to a quiet spot to discuss what you will bring to the minstrel."
9,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_09","You reveal your selection to Nhagi'a, but he chooses to keep his a surprise. Having then acquired your respective items, you head back to the Ruby Road Exchange, where the wandering minstrel awaits."
10,"TEXT_FESANV801_04544_SEQ_10","You present your acquisition to the minstrel, who declares its suitability for his composition before turning his attention to Nhagi'a. The lad reveals his object to be the scrapbook of articles taken from <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>, the Gridanian tabloid where his sister works as a reporter. During the Calamity, said sister traveled the realm, interviewing adventurers about their journeys, and her tales instilled in him the desire to see the world. Your combined contributions serve to inspire the minstrel, who conceives of a verse and proceeds to perform it. No sooner does he strum the first chord than you are transported to a place beyond time and space, where you meet with the mysterious Naoki Yoshida. The man thanks you for continuing to grace the realm with your presence, and hints that change is coming. Yet come what may, he hopes that your journey together shall ever continue.

Returning to reality, you bid Nhagi'a well as he sets off on his own. And after the young adventurer has disappeared from sight, the minstrel performs for you another song─one of futures unknown and journeys unending. Hardships may await upon the road ahead, and there may be times when you feel defeated. But so long as you harbor love for this world, ever shall there be a place for you in it."
