49,"TEXT_BANARK125_04575_MARU_000_002","The Radiant Host commissioned a major delivery, an' while the hippos hauled the supplies quick enough, we ain't got enough help off-loadin' them. You up for a bit of exercise?"

57,"TEXT_BANARK125_04575_RADIANTSOLDIER04575_000_031","It appears the other Rider will be along soon with the rest of the crates, so you can go ahead and thank Maru for another job well done."
