※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW702_04520_SEQ_01","The investigator introduces you to Marke, an expert on the occult sent by the guild to assist you in apprehending the Scarlet Snout. After sharing a brief explanation on the nature of the so-called Night of Devilry, he presents you with two of his prized inventions that he hopes will serve to make your journey much less precarious. Properly equipped, you prepare to make for the Scarlet Snout's domain and steel yourself for the battle ahead.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

Equipped with the tools you need to ensure your safety in the spectral realm, you go to seek out the harlequin guide under the Bentbranch Meadows bridge or in the Acorn Orchard, that you might be shown to the banquet. Once you have completed your business at the Phantoms' Feast, the Adventurers' Guild investigator will be eagerly awaiting evidence of your experience there in the form of one of the pumpkin cookies the Snout is said to be distributing to his guests."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW702_04520_SEQ_03","You regale the Adventurers' Guild investigator with a tale of your time at the feast. He thanks you for your efforts, and assures you that he has warned the other invitees not to take the Snout up on his offer, so that there will be no further victims. Assured that the denizens of Gridania are safe from the red-nosed fiend's trickery, you consider paying the festivities another visit or two to make sure there are no other lost souls in need of your help."
