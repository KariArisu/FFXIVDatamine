Volusus will not be moved."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZD102_04503_SEQ_01","Volusus succeeds in persuading you and Galla to search the ruins for clues to his parents' whereabouts. Though he had initially intended to visit their family home, the streets above have become far too dangerous, so you agree to go in his stead.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZD102_04503_SEQ_02","Volusus's directions prove remarkably useful and you are soon able to locate his house, ruined though it may be. You join Galla in sifting through the rubble for anything that might lead you to the boy's parents."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZD102_04503_SEQ_03","You succeed in finding a letter addressed to Volusus among what remains of his house. Galla, who is also engaged in the search, will be eager to inspect this vital clue."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZD102_04503_SEQ_04","Upon viewing the letter, Galla deducts it was left here for Volusus by his parents in the event he returned to the house. However, a considerable amount of time has clearly passed since then, and the missing family members are nowhere to be seen."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZD102_04503_SEQ_05","Volusus is thrilled to discover there is a good chance his mother Vipsania is still alive. Though this is a step in the right direction, there is much to be done before the family is reunited."
