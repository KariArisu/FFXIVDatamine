Charmion has one last question to ask you."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_SEQ_01","Charmion, it seems, has saved her most philosophical question for last: how do you feel about your place in the grand scheme of things? To help you better understand her own calling in life, the inquisitive observer bids you follow her northwest to the Anagnorisis archives.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_SEQ_02","The archives in question contain rows of what appear to be administrative records. Charmion has given you leave to browse these documents at your leisure..."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_SEQ_03","Upon perusing the documentation, you discover a staggering number of observation logs─many of them written in Overseer Sokles's hand. Charmion waits nearby, eager to hear your thoughts."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_SEQ_04","Now that you have some inkling of the sheer volume of the overseer's work, Charmion admits to some trepidation at being chosen as Sokles's successor. For his part, however, Sokles has full confidence in her knowledge and ability, and credits you for helping prepare the way for his “return to the star”..."

52,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_SOKLES_000_004","Charmion, perhaps you can provide our friend here with an example of what you mean. Such a nebulous question requires a more recognizable foundation from which to answer."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_CHARMION_000_005","Yes, you're right, of course! We must not skip the journey in our haste to reach the destination."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_CHARMION_000_006","Where to begin? Broadly speaking, we study the wisdom and magicks of our forebears, and choose our path as our interests and talents begin to crystallize."

67,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_SYSTEM_000_044","A stack of half-finished observation logs. Judging by the penmanship, the author is someone other than Sokles."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_CHARMION_000_049","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Did you find the observation logs enlightening?"
69,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_CHARMION_000_050","Overseer Sokles has built up quite a library, hasn't he? He's logged comprehensive observations on every living being in Anagnorisis─not only objective physical descriptions, but also his personal thoughts and impressions."
70,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_CHARMION_000_051","And that's why I'm here: to carry on the overseer's invaluable work."
71,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_CHARMION_000_052","When it comes to the continued success of Anagnorisis, our purposes are very much aligned."
72,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_CHARMION_000_053","I cannot help but worry, however, that I lack the same degree of perception and ability; that I am unfit for the task I have chosen. Even being in the same room as those logs is enough to make me feel uncomfortable."

78,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_SOKLES_000_060","If all I wanted was someone to emulate my work, why, I would simply continue doing it myself. No, the reason I asked you to assume my role is because I believe you can take our projects in new and novel directions."
79,"TEXT_AKTKZG104_04510_SOKLES_000_061","Raising you as a competent successor is the final step of <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> purpose in life. Do me proud, Charmion─it is your growth, your efforts, which will facilitate my return to the star."
