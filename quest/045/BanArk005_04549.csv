※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_01","Trna relates that the new meyhane is a hit with the locals, putting so many adventuring types at her disposal that she now receives direct requests from the Radiant Host itself. Perhaps predictably, Ghasa interrupts this good news with reports of a gaggle of Gajasura heading straight for Svarna, so she asks you to extend an adventurer's welcome to Acala's cohorts. While she doesn't yet explain her reasons, Trna leaves you with one, immovable condition: whatever fighting occurs must not end in tragedy.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_02","You give your Gajasura guests the warmest welcome that will allow you to leave the confrontation unscathed. They will hopefully remain subdued for some time, allowing you to regroup with Trna."
3,"TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_03","When you arrive, Ogul has her weapon drawn and tensions are running high. Acala demands that the Hippo Riders forfeit Svarna and leave immediately. Trna retorts that Acala and his people should join the Riders instead of fighting them. Unable to reconcile their differences, Trna finally starts speaking Acala's language when she challenges him, leader to leader, to a race on hippo carts across a predetermined stretch of the island. Acala, confident in his abilities, accepts and heads directly to the starting line at Yedlihmad."
4,"TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_04","Trna immediately regrets challenging Acala to a race, fearing it will besmirch the Riders' hard-earned reputation. You assuage her concern by suggesting that the race be held as an official, public festivity. Citizens from across Thavnair are invited to witness the landmark competition between the Arkasodara and Gajasura, the first of its kind on the island─or, perhaps, anywhere. Bolstered by your reassurance, Trna bids you accompany her as she negotiates terms of engagement with Acala."
5,"TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_05","Since the outcome of the race will affect the lives of many, Trna offers Acala the option of drawing upon his battle brothers' strength during the race. Acala rebuffs her, insisting that he, and he alone, is strong enough to win. Trna, on the other hand, decides to rely upon not only her associates' guidance, but yours. She pulls you aside to share her strategy."
6,"TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_06","Trna explains her plan: Maru and Ghasa will keep you updated on the race's progress from key locations along the track, and you will use their intel to coach Trna as she rides. Additionally, Maru offers some colorful ingenuity to draw out the full extent of Saurya's enthusiasm when the time is right. Linkpearl in ear, you set off for the finish line by the Giantsgall Grounds and wait for history to begin..."
7,"TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_07","Thanks to your advice and Trna's undeniable skill with a cart, she secures victory by a hippo's nose. Instead of lording her win over the frustrated Acala, however, Trna instead entreats him once more to join her. Besieged by a heartfelt speech and his own sense of duty towards his brothers, Acala accepts, and you extend to Trna your congratulations."
8,"TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_08","While the Hippo Riders were shocked by the Gajasura addition to their family, Trna says she was able to smooth things over with her associates. She has a racing gate installed in Svarna to commemorate the legendary race between her and Acala, with ambitions to hold more in the future. Your heart is filled with ever higher hopes for Trna and all her associates, old and new, as you continue to rebuild a thriving Thavnair."
