49,"TEXT_BANARK128_04578_MARU_000_001","I'm talkin' about Akyaali crab legs─as popular as they are pointy! Still, the creature that bears 'em should be easy prey for you. I reckon they'll know it, too, so don't be stingy with the bait if you want 'em to come scuttlin'."
50,"TEXT_BANARK128_04578_MARU_000_002","Just to be on the safe side, you'd best set down three of these fish, eh? Space 'em out, too, so as to better your chances. Safe huntin', friend."

53,"TEXT_BANARK128_04578_MARU_000_005","Ah, yes... These are exactly what I was lookin' for. Thank you for bringin' me such fine specimens─we'll feed many a hungry Hippo Rider with these."
54,"TEXT_BANARK128_04578_MARU_000_006","...An' plenty of visitors besides, no doubt. Not a lot of cooks linin' up to duel those spindly buggers, even if their meat makes for some of the most mouthwaterin' seafood on the island."
55,"TEXT_BANARK128_04578_MARU_000_007","Toss 'em in a curry and their flavor still sings through the spices, or throw 'em in a biryani for some delightful texture. And that's just the beginnin'..."
56,"TEXT_BANARK128_04578_MARU_000_008","'Course, if they ain't fresh, they ain't nearly as tasty, so it may not be long before we're needin' more. Until then!"
