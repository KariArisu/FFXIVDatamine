※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM801_04540_SEQ_01","Noticing the sweat on your brow from the summer heat, Mayaru Moyaru motions you to visit Costa del Sol so you can cool down by taking a dip in its serene waters. He implores you to enjoy the Moonfire Faire festivities while you are there, and mentions the return of a mysterious attraction. To learn more, it seems you must speak with his colleague, Haermaga, in the seaside resort.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

4,"TEXT_FESSUM801_04540_SEQ_04","Both of R'fhul Tia's apprentices introduce themselves to you at his behest. Though he seems quite confident he will succeed in his attempt through the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, you notice that the two of them and R'majha are worried about him. Proceed to the destination to watch how he performs."
5,"TEXT_FESSUM801_04540_SEQ_05","R'fhul Tia's attempt ended in failure. After such a fall, he is in dire need of help. Render him aid with all haste."
