Galla scans her surroundings, but for what...or whom?"
1,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_SEQ_01","Galla of the Ist Legion has recently made her way to Camp Broken Glass with the refugees, though she was hoping that a young, red-haired boy was among their number. Prior to Galla's departure, he was refusing to leave Tertium, and she believes the child is most likely still there. She petitions your aid in persuading the boy to join his countrymen at your camp, that he may benefit from the food and warmth on offer.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_SEQ_02","Upon arriving at the station, Galla tells you a little more about the boy, in particular his name: Volusus. Although he is probably rather reluctant to cooperate, his distinctive scarlet locks should at least make him easy to locate."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_SEQ_03","You eventually find Volusus, and as he explains, he has no intention of going anywhere without his parents. He does, however, have something he wishes to discuss with you, and Galla urges you to hear him out in the hope he will eventually agree to join you at Camp Broken Glass."

49,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_002","Hmm... He's probably still refusing to budge."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_003","Oh, my apologies. Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Galla, Ist Legion. I've been doing what I can for the refugees...though I suppose I'm one myself."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_004","You see, I've always tried to help those in need─some call me a busybody, in fact. Before joining the military, I was a member of the Vigiles Urbani, and it was our duty to keep the citizenry safe. Old habits die hard, though, which is why I'm determined to look after that lad."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_005","He's been separated from his parents in the chaos, but he won't leave the station without them."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_006","Thing is, that's no place for a child his age to be fending for himself─you've seen the conditions there. He needs food and warmth, which you and yours have been kind enough to offer."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_007","I should go back to the station to try persuading him to join your camp. Could I trouble you to accompany me? It'll do him good to see you're not the monsters he probably thinks you are."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_008","Thank you! Well then, no time like the present!"
56,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_010","If my prediction is correct, he should still be around here."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_011","His name's Volusus, but most know him better for his scarlet locks. Considering how reluctant he is to leave, I doubt he'd answer if we tried calling out for him. Would you mind helping me look?"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_020","Where could he be? You wouldn't think it'd be this hard to find someone with a shiny crop of red hair like his..."

60,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_022","Volusus! We've been looking everywhere for you! Still refusing to join everyone at the other camp, I see."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_VOLUSUS_000_023","I'm not going anywhere. Not without Mum and Dad."

66,"TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_GALLA_000_029","Sorry to burden you, but I've a feeling he'll be more cooperative once he's got this off his chest. Hear him out, would you?"
