2,"TEXT_AKTKEA103_04538_SEQ_02","By learning about the Twelve as They are worshipped, G'raha hopes to identify any similarities or differences between Them and the beings you encountered; in so doing, he believes you will draw closer to the truth of their identities. Your mission thus established, you set out first for Rhalgr's Reach, the holy ground for disciples of the Destroyer."
3,"TEXT_AKTKEA103_04538_SEQ_03","Upon arriving at your destination, Deryk states that those places where phantom realm sightings are known to occur often have a tradition of Twelve worship. Encouraged by this fact, you split up to seek out people who may possess knowledge about the local faith."

5,"TEXT_AKTKEA103_04538_SEQ_05","Skimming over the scripture, G'raha Tia finds an account of the construction of the great image of the Destroyer. The text states that, among the refugees who followed Rhalgr's comet to safety during the Sixth Umbral Calamity, some few claimed to have caught sight of the divinity Himself. Yet even as you struggle to decide whether the mysterious beings gave rise to their respective faiths or were born of them, Rhalgr and Byregot appear before you once more, in the form of a hawk and a spriggan respectively. The two explain that mortals may catch glimpses of them in their true forms when the aether surrounding their sanctums becomes unstable─a phenomenon known to occur during an Umbral Calamity. Having shared this detail in lieu of an apology for their earlier deception, the pair then take their leave. As you discuss these revelations, Krile contacts you with word that she has recruited an acquaintance to your cause─an authority on mythology. While G'raha Tia takes himself to the Sunken Temple of Qarn to receive this individual, you are tasked with going ahead to Ul'dah with Deryk to make inquiries about Nald'thal."
