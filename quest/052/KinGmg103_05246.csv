1,"TEXT_KINGMG103_05246_SEQ_01","As neither memories nor records of Gulool Ja's mother may exist, G'raha Tia suggests splitting up to question the greatest number of people. He and the others will ask around Solution Nine, and you will gather information by speaking with the residents of the outskirts."
2,"TEXT_KINGMG103_05246_SEQ_02","While the people you question have no direct knowledge of the Mamool Ja you seek, their stories contain tidbits of Zoraal Ja's history that imply a larger picture with missing pieces. The best course of action would be to return to the Backroom and see if the others can help make the picture whole."
3,"TEXT_KINGMG103_05246_SEQ_03","The collected stories of you and your comrades reveal that nearly twenty years ago, Zoraal Ja began visiting a settlement located in a region known as Yuweyawata, where he once battled and defeated a tural vidraal, together with a cadre of Landsguard─one of whom was a female Mamool Ja. This settlement may have also been the site of clandestine research, and Shale determines its location by analyzing the history of supplies sent from Everkeep. With your next destination determined, Gulool Ja is eager to set forth and learn more of his family."
4,"TEXT_KINGMG103_05246_SEQ_04","With a glimmer of excitement in his eyes, Gulool Ja says he is ready to cross the lake. The young king will stay close behind as you cut a path through the long-forgotten facility.

5,"TEXT_KINGMG103_05246_SEQ_05","Besting both feral beasts and inhuman abominations, you traverse the derelict facility, slowly uncovering its terrible purpose. At the end of your path, you come upon a storm raging over a deep canyon, and as you draw near the winds cease as a howl resounds in your ears. Breaking free from its prison, a tural vidraal descends from the skies to wreak havoc upon the land. Yet even such boundless fury is no match for you and your allies, and after a fierce battle, the beast lies broken and dying.

※In the event that you leave Yuweyawata, you may return via the driftdowns."
6,"TEXT_KINGMG103_05246_SEQ_06","As you watch the tural vidraal breathe its final breath, the Echo imparts to you a vision of its past. In it, Zoraal Ja approves Kanilokka's proposal to experiment with the transference of human souls into bestial vessels, and after the researcher departs, Zoraal Ja is joined by a Mamool Ja woman. Addressing her as Teeshal Ja, the King of Resolve commands her to aid the project, and she accepts on one condition: that should the work bear fruit, she is permitted to take what she herself desires most of all. The vision ends on this vague note, and after you share its contents with the others, it is concluded that Teeshal Ja may be the woman you have been looking for. Emboldened by this new revelation, Gulool Ja wishes to search the facility further."
7,"TEXT_KINGMG103_05246_SEQ_07","With the facility now devoid of threats, you are free to search for clues of Teeshal Ja's background. Gaining access to the upper floor of the observatory would be prudent at this juncture..."
