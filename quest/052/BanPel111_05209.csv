48,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_YUBLI_000_001","On one of our recent tours around the Fields of Gold, several guests asked whether they could help with work in the paddies. This got me thinking─perhaps we could offer such an experience as part of a bespoke new tour!"
49,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_YUBLI_000_002","I thought it fitting that our special advisor be among the first to take part! I'd love to hear your honest thoughts."
50,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_YUBLI_000_003","The “Fields of Gold Farming Taster Tour” is proving wildly popular. It seems visitors enjoy the sense of connection with the local environment and Hanu way of life the experience provides. It's as smooth a start as I could have hoped for."
51,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_YUBLI_000_004","Nonetheless, there is always room for improvement. Despite having already experienced the tour, I daresay you'll have some more useful insights."
52,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_YUBLI_000_005","Speak with the paddy tour guide in the Fields of Gold. They'll provide you with more details!"
53,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_HANUHANU05209_000_010","If it isn't the special advisor! Welcome! It's a pleasure to have you taking part. Let's make a start, shall we?"
54,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_HANUHANU05209_000_011","Reeds thrive in these paddies, but they still require regular tending."
55,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_HANUHANU05209_000_012","One thing we look out for is when reeds sprout too close to one another, as they tend to grow slender and stunted. To ensure a healthy crop, we routinely thin the reeds until they're ready to harvest."
56,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_HANUHANU05209_000_013","The slender reeds we pluck out during the process are used by artisans to make all manner of goods. Which is why we'll be offering guests on this farming taster a discount on reed handicrafts!"
57,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_TOURIST05209_000_014","Haha, now that's a clever ploy! I'm just happy to get a hands-on experience, but once I'm finished in the fields, I might have to browse a few of the stalls back in the village!"
58,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_TOURIST05209_000_015","I wanted see how the reeds I tended to last time were faring, so I signed up again!"
59,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_HANUHANU05209_000_016","That's wonderful to hear! It's a pleasure to share our customs with visitors, whether it be festivals or farming techniques!"
60,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_HANUHANU05209_000_017","You'll soon spot the overcrowded clusters that need tending to. All you need to do is pull out the stunted plants!"
61,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_TOURIST05209_000_018","I'm an assistant grower at Seafoam Fields in Tuliyollal. I thought I'd come and see Hanu horticulture firsthand. Some of their methods might prove useful on our plots back home."
62,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_HANUHANU05209_000_019","As I said, it's easy to spot the overcrowded clusters. If you'd be so kind as to pull out the excess plants, that would be much appreciated!"
63,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_HANUHANU05209_000_030","Wonderful! I couldn't have done a better job myself. Feel free to leave the reeds you uprooted on the ground. My associates and I will come and gather them up later."
64,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_TOURIST05209_000_031","Whew, I'm starting to feel it in my back...but that's all part of the fun. I think I'll keep going for a while longer."
65,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_HANUHANU05209_000_032","Thanks for your help. Usually we spread our rich blend of natural fertilizer after thinning out the reeds, but you can leave that step to us."

68,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_YUBLI_000_041","Thinning reeds may be a mundane task, but it's essential to ensure the health of the crop. As long as we receive positive feedback from those taking part, we'll look to offer the experience again during the next harvest season."
69,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_YUBLI_000_042","Some visitors have signed up for the experience multiple times. They seem to enjoy seeing the reeds they tended to steadily flourish."
70,"TEXT_BANPEL111_05209_YUBLI_000_043","Ultimately, I think the Hanu will appreciate having a regular stream of helpers in their reed fields. I hope you consider taking part again soon!"
