Much to everyone's surprise, his cries are soon answered by none other than Sareel Ja.

He claims to be the architect behind the city and its denizens, using the power of echoes from a place beyond space and time. His goal is to create a new ruler for Tural, and perhaps even the world, by combining the strength of powerful entities from another world─Vana'diel. Sareel Ja's confidence in his plan is palpable as he vanishes into the aether, leaving behind a promise to return once further preparations are complete."
