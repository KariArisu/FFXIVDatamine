49,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_YUBLI_000_002","I wish to know which aspects of the region and its culture they're interested in, and how they feel about their experience so far."
50,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_YUBLI_000_003","Please seek out three guests in Ok'hanu. By sending along you, our special advisor, my hope is that they'll provide frank, unfettered feedback!"
51,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_TONAWAETAN05208_000_010","A guest survey about the appeal of Hanuhanu culture? Hmmm. I'm an architect by trade, so I often end up viewing the world from a professional standpoint..."
52,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_TONAWAETAN05208_000_011","I'm certainly fascinated by the local construction methods. Of course, there are plenty of Hanuhanu living in the capital, but it's remarkable to see the differences between the structures here and the Hanu-built houses in Tuliyollal."
53,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_TONAWAETAN05208_000_012","I must say I'm awed by the expressiveness of reeds as a building material. From the houses to the festival floats and effigies, the designs have such wonderful personality. And when those yellow stems catch the spray from the river, they glint like gemstones in the sunlight. It's such a beautiful sight."
54,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_TONAWAETAN05208_000_013","I definitely found myself enthralled by the House of Winds High! Ok'hanu has its charms, but to see architecture and the natural world in such harmony is a rare treat indeed."
55,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_SYSTEM_000_014","You jot down the red-haired Tonawawta's thoughts."
56,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_TONAWAETAN05208_000_015","Wherever I go, examining the local architecture is one of my favorite pastimes!"
57,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_HANUHANU05208A_000_016","My guest certainly knows a thing or two about architecture. As a matter of fact, I'm learning a great deal from him!"
58,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_SHETONA05208_000_017","You want to hear about my experience so far? I was about to go and get something to eat, but I'm happy to stop and chat for a moment."
59,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_SHETONA05208_000_018","I've enjoyed learning about the Hanuhanu and their relationship with reeds. I was surprised to find out that the crop is also a staple part of the local diet. I tried some myself─so crisp and delicious!"
60,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_SHETONA05208_000_019","Well, for starters, the rivers here are teeming with life. And with all the locally made rods and whatnot for sale, it's an angler's paradise! Hehe, I can't wait to sample some fresh fish dishes later!"
61,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_SHETONA05208_000_020","I visited Uyuypoga the other day. Apparently, the name means “fruit trees” in the local tongue. The Hanuhanu say that the forest's abundance flows from Kixaihih's shrine. I definitely sensed that power while I was there!"
62,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_SYSTEM_000_021","You jot down the silver-haired Shetona's thoughts."
63,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_SHETONA05208_000_022","It's been tough deciding what to eat. Everything looks so mouthwatering!"
64,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_XBRAAL05208_000_023","My take on the local culture? Not sure I've got anything all that insightful to say─I'm just here out of curiosity. Still, I'm happy to share my thoughts."
65,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_XBRAAL05208_000_024","That float over there─the Hanu use that for Ihih'hana, right? I only caught a glimpse of them rehearsing during the tour, but it's clear the festival means a lot to them."
66,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_XBRAAL05208_000_025","The Fields of Gold were a real spectacle. I get the impression reeds are a fundamental part of daily life in the region. Either way, seeing the crop gently swaying in the breeze is something I won't soon forget."
67,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_XBRAAL05208_000_026","I have a newfound respect for the Hanuhanu and their wind magicks. They may be bulky, but watching them leap down from on high and land without so much as a whisper was simply marvelous!"
68,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_SYSTEM_000_027","You jot down the cobalt-haired Xbr'aal's thoughts."
69,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_XBRAAL05208_000_028","One thing's for certain, there's far too much to see in a single trip!"
70,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_HANUHANU05208B_000_029","Seeing our guests delight at what we consider commonplace is a real joy!"
71,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_YUBLI_000_040","Welcome back. How did the survey go?"
72,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_YUBLI_000_041","Hmmm. Very insightful indeed."
73,"TEXT_BANPEL110_05208_YUBLI_000_042","These responses will be crucial in formulating our ongoing plans as a business. You have my sincere thanks!"
