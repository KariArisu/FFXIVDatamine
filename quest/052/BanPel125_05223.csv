52,"TEXT_BANPEL125_05223_WAWKESA_000_012","Well, today, a guide friend of mine took the lunches with her as she usually does. Being an incurable scatterbrain, though, she only grabbed the customer packs and forgot to take her own."

54,"TEXT_BANPEL125_05223_WAWKESA_000_014","I need someone to deliver a meal to our forgetful guide before she pushes too far on an empty stomach. You'll find her somewhere around Marsh Ligaka─hopefully upright and not fainted by the wayside."
