53,"TEXT_BANPEL113_05211_YUBLI_000_021","It was the Hanuhanu who shared the repellent recipe with us. Apparently, it's especially effective at warding off fiends native to Kozama'uka."
54,"TEXT_BANPEL113_05211_YUBLI_000_022","Thanks to that powerful scent, fiend encounters are down, and customer satisfaction is up! It's also alleviated some of the burden placed on our guides-turned-protectors. Anyway, we soon get through the stuff, so I'll let you know the next time our stocks need replenishing!"
