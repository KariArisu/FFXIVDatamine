49,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_YUBLI_000_001","He's a reliable fellow, so I don't suppose for a moment that he's just abandoned the cargo. Would you mind going to see what the problem is? Knowing the usual delivery schedule, I imagine he's somewhere nearby."
50,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_YUBLI_000_002","We're due another shipment of feed, but as usual, it's proving difficult to transport without the aid of the alpacas..."
51,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_YUBLI_000_003","I'd be grateful if you could find the courier and carry the feed back to the alpaca enclosure."
52,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_HARDWORKER05204_000_005","<pant> <pant> Talk about backbreaking labor─this load is far too heavy for me! Still, I can't let the alpacas down!"
53,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_HARDWORKER05204_000_006","Ah, you look like you've carried a crate or two in your time! Would you be willing to help?"
54,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_HARDWORKER05204_000_007","<pant> <wheeze> Ah, y-you're the one who lent a hand last time! I'd be grateful for your help again!"
55,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_HARDWORKER05204_000_008","Take that wooden crate and deliver it to the alpaca handler. Anything to lighten the load is appreciated! I'll be right along, just as soon as I've...<wheeze>...caught my breath."
56,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_HARDWORKER05204_000_009","If you'd kindly take that wooden crate over to the alpaca handler...<wheeze>...I'd be eternally grateful! I just need to rest a while longer..."

62,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_ALPACAMANAGER05204_000_015","Ah, that must be part of the order... Thanks for the help!"
63,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_ALPACAMANAGER05204_000_016","You did well to manage. I swear those crates weigh as much as a fully grown punutiy! They're full of special feed for the alpacas─enriched with succulent highland corn."
64,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_ALPACAMANAGER05204_000_017","Even when they get tired or sick and lose their appetite, we mix in a handful of the good stuff and they soon perk up!"
65,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_ALPACAMANAGER05204_000_018","Honestly, one whiff is all it takes to distract them. So much so that they simply refuse to carry the feed and just stand there on the spot, kicking up a fuss. Hence why it falls to us to handle the cargo."
66,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_ALPACAMANAGER05204_000_019","Great to see you pitching in to help again! Much obliged. This'll keep us going for the time being."
67,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_ALPACAMANAGER05204_000_020","I tell you, transporting the feed is quite the task. We're so used to the alpacas handling the heavy loads. When it falls to us to carry the odd crate or two, it's easy to get overwhelmed."
68,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_ALPACAMANAGER05204_000_021","Anyway, I appreciate the assistance. Feel free to let Yubli know the shipment has arrived."
69,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_ALPACAMANAGER05204_000_022","I'll have to wait for the rest to arrive. In the meantime, would you mind letting Yubli know the shipment has been taken care of?"
70,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_YUBLI_000_023","Thanks for helping with the delivery. The alpacas will be delighted their favorite treat is back in stock!"
71,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_YUBLI_000_024","We've tried all manner of tricks to get them hauling the feed, but nothing works. Even with an airtight seal on the crates, they soon sniff out the corn and refuse to comply!"
72,"TEXT_BANPEL106_05204_YUBLI_000_025","Suffice it to say we'll have need of your crate-carrying services again. Until next time!"
