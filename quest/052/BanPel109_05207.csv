49,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_YUBLI_000_002","Clearly, our policy of assigning two guides per guest was a wise call. Not to mention the investment made in training facilities and so forth. Still, the guides are keen to seek your counsel. Can I trouble you to speak with them?"
50,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_YUBLI_000_003","I believe they headed south from Ok'hanu. Please see how they're faring."
51,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_000_010","Ah, thank you for coming! This toucalibri came flying at us, but as you can see, it was no match for the two of us. Being able to support one another during the incident was remarkably reassuring!"
52,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_000_011","We're concerned about our guest, though. He's been a little out of sorts since the attack, muttering about this and that. I fear the incident has upset him."
53,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_000_012","Would you be willing to speak with him and find out what the matter is? The two of us will stand guard while you do."
54,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_000_013","I'm not quite sure what's wrong with our guest. Perhaps he's in shock after the incident... Could you talk to him for us?"
55,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_TOURIST05207_000_014","Whoooaaah!"
56,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_TOURIST05207_000_020","Kozama'uka is practically bursting at the seams with life! That fiend rushed right at us with such vigor! And the guides─so gallant! What a thrill!"
57,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_TOURIST05207_000_021","Ah, the Hanuhanu fellows are concerned about my well-being? My apologies. I got so caught up in the sheer magnificence of this place!"
58,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_TOURIST05207_000_022","I was startled when that bird came screeching out of the trees, but the guides soon dealt with the creature. Seeing them command the wind with such poise was a sight to behold!"
59,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_000_023","Ah, I'm glad you weren't frightened by the ordeal."
60,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_100_023","Thank you for intervening, Special Advisor."
61,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_000_024","It seems like the area is safe enough for us to resume the tour. Perhaps you'd care to tell us how the experience struck you when we do?"
62,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_TOURIST05207_000_025","I feel so alive! There's nothing like a sightseeing trip to really put you in the heart of it all!"
63,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_000_026","I see! It's a relief to see you weren't disturbed by the encounter."
64,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_100_026","And thank you, Special Advisor, for lending a hand."
65,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_HANUHANU05207_000_027","We avoid the most dangerous routes, but that doesn't entirely negate the possibility of encountering a fiend or two. We'll do our best to remain vigilant, but, for whatever reason, we always seem to run into trouble with you..."
66,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_YUBLI_000_030","It seems the customer was enthralled by the ordeal, not to mention the Hanu's command of wind magicks. I daresay he won't soon forget <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> experience! Nonetheless, we might need to reconsider our safety precautions..."
67,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_YUBLI_000_031","Honestly, I'm surprised the customer responded so positively. I suppose those with a desire to travel are simply brave and inquisitive by nature, and that gentleman a good deal more than most!"
68,"TEXT_BANPEL109_05207_YUBLI_000_032","Having you on hand to deal with the problems we can't resolve ourselves is reassuring. You have my thanks as always."
