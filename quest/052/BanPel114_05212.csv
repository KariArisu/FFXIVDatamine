49,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_001","The main problem we're facing, however, is navigating the scattered pieces of broken lumber. Aside from how untidy it looks, we cannot have our guests stumbling over and possibly injuring themselves on errant planks of jagged wood."
50,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_002","But I think I've hit upon an elegant solution. Might I trouble you to head over there and retrieve three of the offending obstacles? All will be explained upon your return."
51,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_010","You recall the souvenirs we were making out of the wreckage of the Flight of We Wingless? Well, they've proven to be unexpectedly popular."
52,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_011","Would you mind heading back to the stairs and picking up a few more pieces of scrap lumber?"
53,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_020","Do you have the scrap lumber? Let's see what we have to work with!"
54,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_030","Hmmm... These are actually in fairly good condition, all things considered. With a little work, we should be able to make use of them."
55,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_031","Upon visiting the Flight of We Wingless, our guests have been asking for something to remember the experience by. That's where I had the idea of fashioning the salvaged lumber into decorative boards."
56,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_032","Once we've sanded off the rough edges, we'll brand the planks with the travel agency's emblem and sell them as souvenirs."
57,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_100_032","Not only will this help to clean up the area around the stairs, but it will also provide the tangible memento our visitors have been asking for. I think the proposal has potential...but we shall see how the sales go."
58,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_033","Ah, I should mention that we spoke to Tseeya and secured permission from the Wing of Reflection to repurpose the scrap lumber. The wood did once belong to a national structure, after all, and part of the profits will be donated towards the stairs' restoration."
59,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_034","Such details aside, I must also extend to you our continued gratitude. We greatly appreciate your assistance with every facet of our enterprise, no matter how trivial it might seem."
60,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_040","My thanks. I'll send these over to Shiplu, our mender, and have her whip up some more decorative boards."
61,"TEXT_BANPEL114_05212_YUBLI_000_041","The more souvenirs we can sell, the quicker the Flight of We Wingless will be restored to its former glory!"
