1,"TEXT_AKTKRA401_05252_SEQ_01","An affable researcher introduces himself as Professor Claudien's new assistant, and requests your presence at Aporia on behalf of his superior. It seems Pandæmonium has intrigue to offer yet, and Claudien would make you a part of it."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA401_05252_SEQ_02","Professor Claudien and his colleagues greet you warmly before explaining that, inspired by a memory Claudien glimpsed of Erichthonios's past, they have commissioned a commemorative mammet of Themis for the young warder. As you are the only one who can return to the past, it falls upon you to travel to Pandæmonium and deliver it to your erstwhile companion."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA401_05252_SEQ_03","Upon arriving in Pandæmonium, you encounter Hegemone. While she understands the allure of witnessing his reaction to your gift, she cautions that as Erichthonios is currently training hard to become a more masterful warder, he may prefer to delay any reunions until he has made greater progress. As an alternative to a face-to-face encounter, she proposes that you conceal yourself in the shadows as she speaks with him, and send out the mammet when the time is right."
4,"TEXT_AKTKRA401_05252_SEQ_04","From your hidden vantage, you learn that despite some hardship, the young warder is doing well under his father's tutelage. At Hegemone's cue, you send the mammet out from hiding, which prompts a pleasantly surprised Erichthonios to remark that he but recently met the emissary at the Words of Lahabrea─where they spoke fondly of their dear friend <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Before he can look too closely at the smile in the shadows nearby, Hegemone sends him away on his next task, happily accompanied by the Themis-shaped keepsake of your time together."
5,"TEXT_AKTKRA401_05252_SEQ_05","Pleased to have been able to assist in your delivery via the art of subterfuge, Hegemone wishes you well as you depart Pandæmonium for what may be the last time. Now all that remains is to return to Claudien and report your success."
6,"TEXT_AKTKRA401_05252_SEQ_06","As a reward for your efforts, Claudien presents you with a Themis mammet of your very own. Now you, too, carry a reminder of friendships forged across the endless expanse of time."
