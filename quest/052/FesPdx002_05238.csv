※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDX002_05238_SEQ_01","Picot shares with you the reason he first became a singer, describing in bittersweet detail the shows he would perform for his ailing childhood friend. He hopes that by taking his act to the Little Ladies' Day stage, his voice will then rise high enough and loud enough to reach her ears even in Thal's somber halls. To that end, he asks that you accompany him to said stage, and seek out inspiration that will help him finalize the details of his Seneschal Prince costume.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

Picot lists off the tasks which now stand before him─including his plans for organizing refreshments from the Quicksand's festival menu─and you offer to convey his finalized costume idea to the waiting Marabel over near Eshtaime's Aesthetics."

5,"TEXT_FESPDX002_05238_SEQ_05","Picot is overjoyed by the favorable response from the crowd, and the royal seneschal congratulates his new performer on a stunning debut. Wondering for a moment if his own lost princess was looking on, Picot vows to make the most of this opportunity to bring delight to all who attend his shows. The “Seneschal Prince” presents you with a matching costume as thanks for your patient assistance, then heads off to prepare for his next appearance. Everything has turned out well, yet the Little Ladies' Day festivities have only just begun─you should heed the royal seneschal's advice and go and enjoy them while they last!"
