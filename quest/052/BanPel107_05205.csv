49,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_YUBLI_000_001","When it comes to local knowledge, you couldn't ask for a better guide. Alas, they struggle with public speaking... Perhaps you could offer some advice and encouragement?"
50,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_YUBLI_000_002","Our guide-in-training seeks further practice. Can I count on your help again?"
51,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_010","Y-You're the agency's special advisor! Did Yubli send you to help me practice? F-Forgive me if I'm a little nervous..."
52,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_011","H-Hello, Special Advisor! Thanks for helping out again. I shall do my best!"
53,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_012","A-Ahem. Let's see. Ah, yes, the waterway right in front of us... It's a tributary of Miyakabek'zu."
54,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_013","The river itself splits into several waterfalls... As a matter of fact, Cave Kikitola was formed over millennia by three of those very same falls. At least, that's what people say."
55,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_100_013","Each of the waterfalls has a name, and well, the names are quite...vivid."
56,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_014","For example, Xopek'...ah, no, that's not it! S-Sorry!"
57,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_015","Xopik' means “necksblood,” and Xo'onu means “armsblood.” Then there's Xodune, which means “legsblood.” Each name relates to, er, you see, the blood spilled, as it were, by our forebears..."
58,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
59,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_A1_000_001","Try to maintain your rhythm until the very end!"
60,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_A1_000_002","No need to be so nervous!"
61,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_A1_000_003","A fascinating account!"
62,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_020","Aaah! I'm so sorry! I let my nerves get the better of me..."
63,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_021","Th-Thank you! I just need to stay calm and let the trivia do the talking..."
64,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_022","Where was I? Ah, yes. Back when the giants still ruled Kozama'uka, Hanu who refused to submit to their tyranny were put to death and dismembered."
65,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_023","Their mutilated bodies were thrown into the river, and from there flowed piecemeal over the separate waterfalls... Although the falls are a beautiful sight to behold, they also remind we Hanu of the sacrifices made by those before us."
66,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_024","And that concludes my introduction to the three falls of Cave Kikitola. Thank you for listening!"
67,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_042","Ahem. On this tour, I shall be explaining all about Ok'hanu─one of our villages."
68,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_043","The settlement is surrounded by paddies, and the reeds grown there have been our livelihood for generations. The crop has many different uses. Not only are the reeds edible, but artisans use them in all manner of crafts."
69,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_044","I personally recommend the dolls they make with reed offcuts. They're especially popular with young Hanu! Ah, I suppose some of our guests won't be interested in toys..."
70,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
71,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_A2_000_001","Try to really sell your recommendation!"
72,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_A2_000_002","You're doing just fine. Keep it up!"
73,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_A2_000_003","You could prepare another tidbit to share with customers uninterested in dolls."
74,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_050","M-My apologies! I was feeling so anxious..."
75,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_051","Th-Thank you! Of course, there are plenty of keepsakes I can recommend besides!"
76,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_052","Er, let's see... If you wish to make a purchase, please head to the northern side of the aetheryte plaza. There are plenty of stalls to browse, so I'm sure you'll find something to suit your tastes."
77,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_053","And for the anglers, there's no shortage of fishing supplies. As a matter of fact, we even offer a special fishing tour for those looking to make the most of the local waterways."
78,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_054","Thank you for listening. I hope you've learnt a great deal about Ok'hanu!"
79,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_055","I stumbled over my words here and there, but as long as I keep practicing, I know I can succeed! Thank you for your help!"
80,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_GUIDETRAINING05205_000_056","I know I'm capable of being an excellent guide─I just need to build up my confidence. Thanks again for all your insight!"
81,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_YUBLI_000_060","Sounds like our guide-in-training benefited from the rehearsal. With a little more practice, they'll soon be ready for their first customer."
82,"TEXT_BANPEL107_05205_YUBLI_000_061","Thank you. Perhaps you can offer some more advice the next time you find yourself at a loose end!"
