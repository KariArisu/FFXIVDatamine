1,"TEXT_KINGMG101_05244_SEQ_01","With Tuliyollal enjoying a period of relative peace, the attendant at the For'ard Cabins suggests you treat yourself to a plate of tacos at the nearby Xbalyav Ty'e. Br'uk Evu's cooking is said to be second to none, and his tavern likely has an open seat with your name on it."
2,"TEXT_KINGMG101_05244_SEQ_02","Br'uk Evu greets you with his characteristic hospitality and accepts your order. You find a table to sit at while your food is being prepared."
3,"TEXT_KINGMG101_05244_SEQ_03","As you get ready to enjoy your meal, you overhear a conversation between a father and his son, the latter who is struggling to adapt to life in the capital after thirty years in Alexandria. Just as the pair resolve to tackle this problem as a family, Wuk Lamat approaches to offer advice. Their situation is a common one, it seems, for she tells them about a group established to help impart the skills required for life outside the dome to returning Turali. Content with having helped her subjects, the Vow of Resolve leaves their table and finally notices you sitting nearby. After a bit of catching up, she mentions that she and Koana have something to discuss with you at the palace. Curious as to what the Dawnservants might want, you agree to attend them."

5,"TEXT_KINGMG101_05244_SEQ_05","Upon entering the throne room, you see several of the former Scions waiting as well. You briefly exchange news on your respective affairs before Koana enters the chamber and explains the reason for the summons: a funeral for Queen Sphene is to be held in Alexandria, and he asks if those present wish to attend. For personal and political reasons, Wuk Lamat decides to pay her respects as a representative of Tuliyollal and requests that you and your allies come along to keep watch over proceedings. With your course of action decided, you are to depart to Solution Nine, where Gulool Ja and Oblivion are making final preparations for the ceremony."
6,"TEXT_KINGMG101_05244_SEQ_06","Gulool Ja is thankful that everyone could attend the funeral, which was planned with the aid of recently recovered historical records. These records indicate that flowers were once placed as offerings to deceased Alexandrians, and so flowers are being distributed to all the attendees. The young king likely knows where to receive them."
