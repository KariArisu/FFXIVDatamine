It calls to mind memories of his journey with a band of adventurers who he alleges brought low the real Shadow Lord in Vana'diel. Another step toward recovering his identity, but there will be more time for reminiscing once the electrope is taken to a safe location. With that in mind, you all return to Tuliyollal."
