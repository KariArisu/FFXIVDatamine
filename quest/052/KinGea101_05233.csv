1,"TEXT_KINGEA101_05233_SEQ_01","There is trouble in Mamook, and Miilal Ja is hopeful the unique insights of an adventurer may shed new light on the situation. Assuming you are willing, the Hoobigo messenger bids you go and speak with her at once."
2,"TEXT_KINGEA101_05233_SEQ_02","As Miilal Ja explains it, their troubles began when they found an armor-clad stranger unconscious in the Skydeep Cenote. They have no means of deducing whence he came, and he himself can remember nothing of who he is. Before they can press further, however, Zereel Ja barges in with upsetting news─the shade of Gulool Ja Ja has returned to Yak T'el. Bakool Ja Ja labors to keep the apparition at bay, but his chances appear grim. The Landsguard will soon be assembled to assist him, but Miilal Ja fears their help will be too little, too late. To that end, she asks you venture to Gok Draak Descent to help her son."
3,"TEXT_KINGEA101_05233_SEQ_03","You find Bakool Ja Ja down, but not yet out, somehow managing to hold his own. Before you can take up arms, another enemy─a young girl named Prishe─soon joins the fray. She is eager to fight, but the shade suggests a tactical withdrawal, disappearing into a nearby portal. Bakool Ja Ja is unsatisfied with this conclusion, and so he gives chase, heedless of what dangers may be lurking beyond the rift."
4,"TEXT_KINGEA101_05233_SEQ_04","The stranger's brief altercation with Prishe has helped him to recall part of his past. He now remembers enough to know that Prishe is a friend, and that some malevolent force has likely taken hold of her. While determined to go and rescue her, his body is quick to protest his attempts to leave. You insist that he rest, regarding the portal with equal parts determination and trepidation.

※Jeuno: The First Walk can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
5,"TEXT_KINGEA101_05233_SEQ_05","No sooner do you step through the portal than you arrive in what appears to be a city, littered with monsters. The ensuing battle feels like a fever dream, unseen powers whisking you from one locale to the next. After overcoming what appears to be the last of the nightmarish foes, you somehow find yourself back where you started in the mysterious city."
6,"TEXT_KINGEA101_05233_SEQ_06","Bakool Ja Ja arrives carrying a slumbering Prishe. She soon stirs awake, bereft of any memory of your previous encounters. Mysteries abound as you struggle to make sense of your surroundings."
7,"TEXT_KINGEA101_05233_SEQ_07","You and Bakool Ja Ja emerge from your ordeal with more questions than answers, but for now you are safe. He thanks you for your timely assistance, but it remains to be seen if he will have further need of your strength."
