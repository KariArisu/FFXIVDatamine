48,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_YUBLI_000_000","It is heartening to see the alpaca crias so full of life. Recently, however, the rambunctious little darlings have been escaping the enclosure and running loose around the agency grounds."
49,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_YUBLI_000_001","I shudder to imagine what might happen should they wander off into the wilds beyond... We've been watching them as closely as we can, but there is a certain troublesome trio that has mastered the art of escape and evasion."
50,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_YUBLI_000_002","I've been told that today is no exception, and would like you to assist with rounding up these fugitive crias. After all, who better to track down an expert at hiding than an expert at finding, like yourself?"
51,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_YUBLI_100_002","Once you have apprehended the escapees, I ask that you hand them over to the alpaca handler. He will be somewhere on the grounds, assisting with the search."

57,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_SEARCHPELUPELU05219_000_007","Gah, I can't find them anywhere!"
58,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_SEARCHPELUPELU05219_000_008","You caught them!? That's all three accounted for─and blessedly uninjured, thank the gods...and you, of course!"
59,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_SEARCHPELUPELU05219_000_009","They've only just found their feet, you see, so running has become their favorite new pastime. All they want to do is break out and dash around, and I swear it will be the death of me..."
60,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_SEARCHPELUPELU05219_000_010","Or would be, if they weren't so damnably adorable. I'm thrilled to see our babies grow healthy and strong, but I will need to keep a closer eye on them!"
61,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_YUBLI_000_011","You caught them already!? This is why we have you as our special advisor."
62,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_YUBLI_000_012","I've helped with returning them to the enclosure before, and capturing even one of the crias took all of my patience and cunning. The endeavor also ended with me having to clean spit off my goggles..."
63,"TEXT_BANPEL121_05219_YUBLI_000_013","They may be a handful already, but the alpacas we're raising here will only continue to grow in number. We'll need to take lessons from the Urqopacha ranch if we're to do our best to care for them."
