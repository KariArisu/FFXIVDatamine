※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMX001_05227_SEQ_01","As you make your way through Gridania during the Starlight Celebration, you come upon the celebrant Amh Garanjy. According to the Miqo'te, a new attraction is to be held for this year's festivities in the form of a market called the Starlight Stalls. However, the preparations are behind schedule, and Amh Garanjy requests your aid in investigating the reason for the delay. To that end, she bids you join her at the stalls, which you may travel to by speaking with the guide at the amphitheatre.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

※In the event that you leave the Starlight Stalls, you may return by speaking with the Starlight Stalls guide at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."

5,"TEXT_FESXMX001_05227_SEQ_05","You inform Amh Garanjy that a combination of the cold and tiredness are to blame for the slow progress of the stalls. As you ponder ways to revive the weary workers, two little friends, Saulinne and Tenny, appear and beg to help. Amh Garanjy gladly accepts their offer, and it is decided that you and the children will see to finding something suitably revitalizing to distribute to the workers."
6,"TEXT_FESXMX001_05227_SEQ_06","Saulinne and Tenny are excited as only children can be for the opportunity to help. Inspired by their enthusiasm, you are determined to see that the Starlight Stalls may open as planned."
