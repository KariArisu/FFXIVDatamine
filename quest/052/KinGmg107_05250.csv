1,"TEXT_KINGMG107_05250_SEQ_01","No sooner do you broach the subject of returning to the dome with Wuk Lamat than does Erenville inquire into the details of your business there. As it happens, he too is considering a sojourn to Alexandria, that he might find a way to aid those affected by the turmoil. Thus do you set off for the Backroom together─with his charming Cahciua curio in tow."
2,"TEXT_KINGMG107_05250_SEQ_02","You arrive at the perfect time to hear the fruits of Shale's labors: a series of audio diaries recorded by Teeshal Ja herself, detailing her feelings for Zoraal Ja and his rejection of their child. Though these disturbing revelations would be overwhelming even for an adult, Gulool Ja puts on a brave face, and even thanks present company for helping him to learn the truth of his birth at long last."
3,"TEXT_KINGMG107_05250_SEQ_03","With Gulool Ja's questions answered, Shale may now commit to other matters, such as Y'shtola's investigative foray into Living Memory. The pair depart with little fanfare, leaving you and your remaining companions to your own devices."
4,"TEXT_KINGMG107_05250_SEQ_04","As your primary concern outside of Gulool Ja is spreading word of the railroad's resumption of service, you speak with Geode, who in turn surprises you with the news that precious few people intend to make the journey to Tuliyollal. Given how many voiced their desire to do so before, this is an odd shift in sentiment indeed, and you and Wuk Lamat resolve to learn what prompted it."
5,"TEXT_KINGMG107_05250_SEQ_05","As you approach a crowd gathered near the site of Sphene's funeral, it is clear from their discourse that they have not only failed to come to terms with their existential turmoil in your absence, but have worked themselves into an ever greater panic over their mortality. Glad are they, then, when their beloved Queen Sphene suddenly appears with a solution: to convert the people into Endless via neo regulators, that they need fear death no longer. Given that you were instrumental in the destruction of the Queen of Reason, you and Wuk Lamat immediately suspect deception, and your doubt only grows when “Sphene” mentions the caveat that, at present, her proposed boon will only be extended to five thousand citizens. Despite Wuk Lamat's protestations, none join you in your skepticism, for the Alexandrians seem to be afflicted with collective amnesia and have no recollection of her death or subsequent funeral..."
6,"TEXT_KINGMG107_05250_SEQ_06","As there is naught to be gained from continuing to make a spectacle of yourself in challenging the queen's claims, you rejoin your companions in the Backroom, there to await further intelligence from Oblivion's members in the field. You will need to proceed with caution until such time as you know more about the entity wearing Sphene's face."
