48,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_YUBLI_000_000","Wawkesa's eatery has been a sound success so far. His approach of tailoring the menu to individual tastes has won him plaudits from visitors, but when supplies run low, he is sometimes unable to furnish guests' requests."
49,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_YUBLI_000_001","In fact, he has just used the last of a certain key spice... It grows here in Kozama'uka, but the journey is a long one, and few can spare the time to forage."
50,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_YUBLI_000_002","I'm loath to trouble you, but I'd have you gather Ihuyka achiote for our resident chef. Three sprigs should yield enough seeds for Wawkesa's cooking. Deliver your harvest to him when you're done!"
51,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_WAWKESA_000_010","Well met, adventurer. I heard you'll be fetching me some fresh achiote. Appreciate the help."
52,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_WAWKESA_100_020","That was quick. Did you get the achiote I needed?"
53,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_WAWKESA_000_020","Perfect. Top-notch quality too."
54,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_WAWKESA_000_021","Ihuyka achiote belongs to same family as the achiote that grows in Yak T'el. Usually, the seeds are ground up into a powder for use in the kitchen."
55,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_WAWKESA_000_022","Achiote is just about essential in Xbr'aal cooking. Same goes for the cuisine here in Kozama'uka. A sprinkle or two really elevates a dish. I also use it to add a touch of color to grilled meat and the like. I couldn't do without it, personally!"
56,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_WAWKESA_000_023","Anyway, I appreciate you traipsing all the way out there to keep my operation running. Be sure to give Yubli my thanks as well."
57,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_WAWKESA_000_030","With a good supply of achiote, I'll be able to keep our guests from Yak T'el happy. As I said, I appreciate the help."
58,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_YUBLI_000_040","May I presume your foraging mission was a success? No doubt Wawkesa was pleased."
59,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_YUBLI_000_041","It seems his time as a cook in Shaaloani gave him a thorough education in a variety of cuisines. Funny that he should end up catering for an entirely different clientele here at the agency."
60,"TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_YUBLI_000_042","Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I shall be in touch next time Wawkesa's spice supplies are running low. I'll warn you now though, with all the flavorsome food on the menu, you might find yourself foraging again quite soon!"
