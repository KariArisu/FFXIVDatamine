49,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_YUBLI_000_002","I fully endorse his wish to introduce more variety to the eatery, so I thought to send our most experienced warrior to procure it. What say you?"
50,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_YUBLI_000_003","Wawkesa has made another procurement request! His Ligaka thigh special was most well received, and he needs to restock his meat supply."
51,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_YUBLI_000_004","Blowing on this game bird whistle near the falls of Miyakabek'zoma should bring a fledgling of Ligaka right to your location. Once you have the meat we need, please make the delivery to Wawkesa."
52,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_WAWKESA_000_005","I made a request to Yubli for fresh ingredients, but I didn't expect they would send <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>. Well, I, uh...appreciate the help. Truly."
53,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_WAWKESA_000_020","Oh, you've brought the meat I tasked Yubli with procuring?"
54,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_WAWKESA_000_021","Now that's a nice hunk of bird! The dishes we used to make from this back in our old, uh, “hunting grounds” were always camp favorites."
55,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_WAWKESA_000_022","The Hanu prefer leafy greens and bugs over beast flesh, so there's not much around in the way of meaty cuisine. A few customers mentioned they'd like something to sink their teeth into, though, and that got me to thinking about a new menu."
56,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_WAWKESA_000_023","The meat is tasty enough just grilled over charcoal... Or maybe I can try that fried bird recipe Chekochuk taught me about!"
57,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_WAWKESA_000_024","People seem to love the recipe Chekochuk taught me for frying the thigh and coating it in “tangyspices.” I can see it becoming a local specialty."
58,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_WAWKESA_000_025","The distinctive flavor─packed with savory tenderness─is something only the fledgling of Ligaka can provide. You have my thanks, as does Yubli. You've done me a great favor here!"
59,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_YUBLI_000_029","Any troubles procuring the meat? If all is well, I can take the whistle off your hands for now."
60,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_YUBLI_000_030","I'm glad to hear Wawkesa was pleased! Such ingredients are difficult to come by without someone trained in battle─which makes us very lucky to have you around."
61,"TEXT_BANPEL122_05220_YUBLI_000_031","Wawkesa's cuisine is greatly enjoyed by our visitors, so I hope you'll be willing to help out again soon!"
