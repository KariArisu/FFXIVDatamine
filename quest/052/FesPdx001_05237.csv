※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDX001_05237_SEQ_01","After finding great success with the Songbirds, the royal seneschal has plans to debut a new act for Little Ladies' Day: the Seneschal Prince. The young man auditioned to play the part, however, has failed to return from picking up his costume. The royal seneschal asks that you make your way to Eshtaime's Aesthetics and see what has befallen Picot, his up-and-coming star.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

It comes to light that the “Seneschal Prince” does not, in fact, know what makes a good seneschal, and he recruits you to form a general consensus of the role by thoroughly questioning the townspeople of Ul'dah."
3,"TEXT_FESPDX001_05237_SEQ_03","You speak to three Ul'dahn residents and gather their thoughts on the topic of seneschals. Picot awaits your revelations at the Gold Court."
4,"TEXT_FESPDX001_05237_SEQ_04","Having learned the qualities people expect in a seneschal, Picot declares himself ready to serve the waiting audience. When it comes to settling the specifics of his princely persona, however, it seems he desires your continued assistance."
