48,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_YUBLI_000_001","Those former bandits make for surprisingly hard workers. I admit, I was nervous about employing them at first, but now I can't imagine running the agency without them."
49,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_YUBLI_000_002","I wonder, however, if they have any qualms about the work they do for us. As you know, the Wing of Reflection is supporting the initiative and we need to report our progress... Would you mind heading out and assisting with the employee interviews?"
50,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_YUBLI_000_003","Our group of former bandits is working as hard as ever. It's gratifying indeed to watch them develop a sense for the sightseeing business."
51,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_YUBLI_000_004","Speaking of which, the time has come to make our regular report to the Wing of Reflection. Would you mind heading out and assisting with the employee interviews?"
52,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_YUBLI_000_005","A Hanu guide is out at Many Fires with one of them this very moment, lending a sympathetic ear to their concerns."
53,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_SHETONA05221_000_009","You want to hear our worries and woes? You people are too good to us..."
54,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_010","Ah, you're just in time! Please feel free to chime in while we discuss this lady's concerns."
55,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_011","Tell us, how do you feel about your tour guide duties? It's fine if you're simply enjoying the work, but please don't hesitate to share any issues you've encountered."
56,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_SHETONA05221_000_012","Hrmmm... There <Emphasis>was</Emphasis> something bothering us lately..."
57,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_SHETONA05221_000_013","Those of us from the old gang, well, we're not the most polite bunch. We try to watch our tongues, but old habits die hard...and we're afraid the customers are put off by our rough way of talking."
58,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
59,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_A1_000_001","You can work on improving it, slowly but surely."
60,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_A1_000_002","Some might find it appealing."
61,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_A1_000_003","The Hanu and the Pelu have their own quirks, as well."
62,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_015","Exactly. There's no need to force yourself! The important thing is that you inform our guests in a friendly manner."
63,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_016","Exactly. There are definitely those who prefer the rougher edge─it can make you seem a more capable guide out here in the wilderness!"
64,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_017","Yes, we all speak a little differently! That's exactly the kind of thing our customers are here to enjoy."
65,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_SHETONA05221_000_018","My friends and me, we're not the cleverest bunch. We know the trails, and we swing a mean axe, but when it comes to explaining the history of a place, we come up short on details..."
66,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
67,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_A2_000_001","You'll pick it up as you go."
68,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_A2_000_002","You can give your own perspective."
69,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_A2_000_003","A mean axe makes up for a lot!"
70,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_020","Exactly. Every day is a chance to learn! Besides, we local guides will be right by your side should you need us!"
71,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_021","Yes, don't sell yourself short! You know a side of Kozama'uka's wilds that we can only imagine."
72,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_022","Exactly! Your martial skills are a great asset! Greater knowledge of the lands we tour through will come in time."
73,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_SHETONA05221_000_023","I hadn't thought about it like that... My thanks! That actually made me feel better! I'll let my comrades know we've been worrying ourselves over nothing."
74,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_024","I'm glad we were able to put your concerns to rest."
75,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_HANUHANU05221_000_025","Now it's time we returned to our guide practice. Please send my best regards to Yubli!"
76,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_YUBLI_000_030","Thank you for listening and providing encouragement. Our newer trainees may have been outlaws once, but none can deny the effort they're making to redeem their less-than-savory past."
77,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_YUBLI_000_031","Although, just between you and me, the chance to be escorted by a former bandit has become something of a draw for certain customers..."
78,"TEXT_BANPEL123_05221_YUBLI_000_032","In any case, as the agency continues to expand, I'm sure new concerns will arise. I'd appreciate it if you could be there for them again when the time comes!"
