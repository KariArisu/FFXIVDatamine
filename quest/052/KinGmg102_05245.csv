67,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_WUKLAMAT_000_101","I'm Vow Wuk Lamat of Tuliyollal. Thank you for extending us an invitation to Queen Sphene's funeral."

71,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_GOSSAN_000_105","Yes, Your Majesty. The flowers are being handed out at the counter yonder, alongside the regulators."
72,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_WUKLAMAT_000_106","What? We need to wear regulators for the funeral?"
73,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_GOSSAN_000_107","Ah, rest assured they are not a requirement. We're aware your people do not use them."
74,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_GOSSAN_000_108","You see, people in the Alexandria of old wore tokens of mourning upon their persons when attending funerals."
75,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_GOSSAN_000_109","As such tokens were black, it was suggested that we might wear regulators painted the same color."

78,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_GOSSAN_000_112","Yet regulator or no, the important thing is that we remember Queen Sphene. Remember her and her kindness as you make an offering of your flower."

83,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_ALISAIE_000_125","Seeing that child reminded me of myself. Of how hard it was for me to accept that Grandfather was gone."

88,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_GULOOLJA_000_201","Shale searched the system for information on residents, but the only Mamool Ja she found listed were my father and me."

90,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_WUKLAMAT_000_203","Well, that you're here means she was here too, inside the dome. There can't be any other way about it."

92,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_A1_000_001","Perhaps we should try looking again."

94,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_GULOOLJA_000_205","Maybe... It's hard to explain. I'm not sad, but I feel like...like I'm missing something."
95,"TEXT_KINGMG102_05245_GULOOLJA_000_206","So even if it makes me feel sad, I want to know my mother."
