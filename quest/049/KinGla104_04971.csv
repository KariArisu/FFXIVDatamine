0,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_SEQ_00","An urgent order has come in, and Rral Soj needs your help to see it completed."
1,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_SEQ_01","Rral Soj has tasked you with crafting lightweight lanterns for a Pelupelu peddler.

※Minimum collectability rating for this delivery is 230. Delivering items with a rating of 470 or more will earn greater rewards."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_SEQ_02","You deliver the lightweight lanterns to Rral Soj. The peddler arrives before long to pick them up, and is thrilled to see her urgent order was completed in so short a time. Unfortunately, however, Papawni seems to have fallen into a slump, failing to craft even a single lantern. Exasperated, Rral Soj pleads with Papawni to pick up her pace, but this only seems to push the former potsworn beyond her breaking point, causing her to flee back to Earthenshire. Rral Soj appears shocked by her employee's sudden departure, and will no doubt need some comforting words once she has had time to process her emotions."

50,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_RRALSOJ_000_011","Our client this time's a travelin' Pelupelu peddler, who needs as many lightweight lanterns as we can make before she departs the city."
51,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_RRALSOJ_000_012","While she'll use a number o' the lanterns herself during her travels, I understand she intends to sell the majority o' 'em to folk back home. I'll need you both workin' at a brisk pace today."
52,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_PAPAWNI_000_013","Y-Yes ma'am! Erm, will the lanterns be used on alpacaback? Or will they be carried by hand?"
53,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_PAPAWNI_000_014","I-It's just that depending on how the lanterns will be used, their intensity, size, and practicality ought to be considered..."

59,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_PAPAWNI_000_017","Oh, I had no idea... I've seen little of the world for myself, so my outlook is probably narrower than most. Mayhap that is why it takes me so long to understand the needs of our patrons."
60,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_PAPAWNI_000_018","J-Just by your intuition alone!? Amazing... I've always had the desired materials and product laid out before me by someone else, so perhaps that is why I never developed such a sense. How liberating it must feel to act by your wits alone..."
61,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_PAPAWNI_000_019","Maybe I should... No, no, this isn't the time. I must concentrate on completing the task set before me first..."
62,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_RRALSOJ_000_020","I'll help her get started. In the meantime, I need you preppin' those lanterns as soon as able. If you can craft at least six, we should be in the clear."
63,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_PAPAWNI_000_030","If the lanterns are to be used for travel, they must be not only lightweight, but durable as well. Which materials would be best suited to accomplish such a feat...? Think, Papawni, think!"

74,"TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_RRALSOJ_000_067","No doubt Papawni understands this most keenly. She failed to craft even a single lantern, after all."
