0,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_SEQ_00","Wuk Lamat has a request to make before setting off to confront Zoraal Ja."
1,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_SEQ_01","Zoraal Ja is on the move once more, marching on Vanguard ahead of a second invasion of Tuliyollal, and you accompany Wuk Lamat as she confronts her brother. As their duel unfolds, the King of Resolve reveals that it is in fact the Queen of Reason who has orchestrated the attacks in order to plunder life force for her people. When Sphene personally appears to confirm the disturbing claim, Zoraal Ja unceremoniously cuts her down, thereby exposing that she is an illusion projected upon a mechanical soldier.

As the battle continues to unfold, Wuk Lamat divests Zoraal Ja of his advantage by destroying his regulator, but he responds by unleashing his war fleet on Tuliyollal. However, his forces are ultimately repelled, prompting him to take drastic measures. Having cut down his own aide for another regulator, he gives the order for all civilians in Everkeep to be executed for their souls, leaving Sphene horrified. It is at that moment that Gulool Ja unexpectedly appears to plead with his father, but Zoraal Ja takes him hostage and places Otis under his thrall. The king then flees, but not before challenging Wuk Lamat to come to the summit of Everkeep, there to settle matters once and for all."
2,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_SEQ_02","Knowing that her brother cares not for others' lives, Wuk Lamat fears the worst for the civilians. So it is that you hasten back to Everkeep, braced for a grueling struggle with Zoraal Ja's mechanical army."
3,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_SEQ_03","Upon entering Solution Nine, you are greeted with scenes of unspeakable carnage as mechanical soldiers carry out their orders with cold efficiency. In spite of Sphene's crimes, Wuk Lamat offers to help her protect her people, and together you make your way through the district to deal with rampant machines and fiends alike. At length you encounter Otis, who remains under Zoraal Ja's control, and are forced to fight him. Sphene's fervent plea awakens the old knight just in time for him to save her from a marauding fiend, and together you succeed in defeating your fearsome foe. Sadly, the exertion proves too much for Otis's aging frame and he ceases to function, having valiantly protected his queen."
4,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_SEQ_04","Thanks to your intervention, the carnage has been brought to an end with Solution Nine being spared the worst. Cahciua asks that you help treat the wounded, and you and your comrades regroup in preparation for the relief effort."
5,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_SEQ_05","Wuk Lamat cannot hide her fury at Zoraal Ja for slaughtering his own citizens, nor her confusion as to why he would commit such an atrocity. But now is not the time to ponder such questions, for there are people in need of help."

51,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_012","Before we get going, I have a request to make of you."
52,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_013","When we confront Zoraal Ja, you must let me face him alone."
53,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_ALISAIE_000_014","What!? No, that's far too dangerous! Why put you at such risk if we don't have to?"
54,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_015","We have two priorities."
55,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_016","The first is to hold Zoraal Ja within the dome and protect Tuliyollal."
56,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_100_016","The second is to free Wayakkwe if she's been captured."
57,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_017","To make sure we succeed, I need to play the worthy foe for Zoraal Ja."
58,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_018","If I come at him with help, he'll likely lose interest and proceed with his attack on the city. That's why it needs to be a duel."
59,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_ALISAIE_000_019","Even if Tuliyollal is better prepared this time, it's true that it would be best to avoid another battle. And failing that, we might at least weaken Zoraal Ja..."
60,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_020","Rest assured I'm not going into this without a strategy. Our time in the dome has given us invaluable insights into Alexandrian culture."
61,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_021","The use of regulators, for one. The secret to Zoraal Ja's strength."
62,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_ALISAIE_000_022","Then you mean to..."
63,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_023","That's right. If I destroy his regulator, he'll be unable to draw upon souls. We'll see how much he wants a duel after that."
64,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_024","So, will you leave Zoraal Ja to me?"
65,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
66,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_A1_000_001","We believe in you, Lamaty'i!"
67,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_A1_000_002","It's nothing the Vow of Resolve can't handle!"

72,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_030","Together with Koana, I'll keep Tuliyollal safe!"

84,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_KRILE_000_065","To slaughter his adopted people too... Is there no end to his villainy?"

87,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_WUKLAMAT_000_081","That he's still bent on surpassing Papa is clear, but why this massacre? I don't understand..."
88,"TEXT_KINGME111_04942_KRILE_000_082","Right now we can only guess at his intent, but his obsession must be strong indeed to endure after thirty years..."
