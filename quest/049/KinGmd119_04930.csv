55,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_030","What's going on? How could Pepoane suddenly forget about Namikka?"
56,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_031","It's as if he never knew her..."
57,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_032","Could the same thing have happened to others as well, I wonder?"
58,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_KRILE_000_033","There's only one way to find out. Let's make inquiries about Namikka in the area. We can reconvene afterwards at the aetheryte."

60,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_GRAHATIA_000_035","As far as I could tell, Pepoane genuinely had no recollection of Namikka."
61,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_KRILE_000_036","We'll see how it is with other people."
62,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_037","I've never seen nor heard of anything like this before."
63,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_OUTSKIRTSRESIDENTA04930_000_040","An old woman named Namikka?"
64,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_OUTSKIRTSRESIDENTA04930_000_041","I'm afraid I don't know that person. I'm sorry I couldn't be of help."

67,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_OUTSKIRTSRESIDENTB04930_000_051","Never met anyone by that name, and I've worked at the outskirts for a good while now. If she'd spent time here, I would remember."
68,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_OUTSKIRTSRESIDENTB04930_000_055","Like as not, this Namikka is up in the cloud..."
69,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_OUTSKIRTSRESIDENTC04930_000_060","Hmmm... I do recall caring for someone until recently. And you say that it was a woman named Namikka?"
70,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_OUTSKIRTSRESIDENTC04930_000_061","While I can't say for certain if it was her, I wouldn't worry. I'm sure she's just been taken up to the cloud."
71,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_OUTSKIRTSRESIDENTC04930_000_065","It's not common, but it does happen from time to time."
72,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_070","So it was the same for everyone."
73,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_071","Not a single person remembers Namikka. It's as if the memory of her has been purged from their minds."
74,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_KRILE_000_072","While such a thing might be done with magic, to alter the memories of so many at once would be a tremendous undertaking. We would have felt a surge of aether corresponding to the act, too, and I sensed none in that moment."
75,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_073","Neither did I. But I did notice something else─right before Pepoane seemingly forgot, a light in the device on his head began to blink."
76,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_GRAHATIA_000_074","Could there be a connection? Someone also said something about “soul cells.”"
77,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_GRAHATIA_000_075","But who might we ask about this? If we continued making such inquiries, I expect we would only cause confusion."
78,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_076","Indeed... If we can't readily solve the mystery about Namikka, perhaps we could search for Cahciua instead?"
79,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_077","Sphene said to try the Thunderyards."
80,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_078","It should be in this direction."
81,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_CAHCIUA_000_079","(-Unidentified Floating Object-)<gasp> Impossible!"
82,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_080","Hm?"
83,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_081","Another kind of mechanical soldier!? It looks dangerous! We'd better destroy it!"
84,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_CAHCIUA_000_082","(-Unidentified Floating Object-)Uwaaah!"
85,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_KRILE_000_083","Should we give chase?"
86,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_084","I think it understood our words. It might be worth asking it some questions."
87,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_085","...Erenville? Are you alright? You look like you've seen a ghost."
88,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_086","I-It's nothing. I'm fine."
89,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_087","Well, it went off in the direction we're headed anyway, so let's try to track it down."
90,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_090","Nothing but birds over here."
91,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_095","It's faster than it looks."
92,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_KRILE_000_100","No sign of it over here."
93,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_GRAHATIA_000_105","I do not see it..."
94,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_108","That voice... Could it be...?"
95,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_110","You found it!?"
96,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_111","To the northeast? Then it must be bound for the mines."
97,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_112","Come on, then!"
98,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_113","It could well be a trap, so let's not rush in too quickly."
99,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_115","So it went in here?"
100,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_120","I think it's safe to assume it went into the mines."
101,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_KRILE_000_125","An old coal mine? It appears to have long since been abandoned, like so many other places."
102,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_GRAHATIA_000_130","The stones in those crates... Could it be turquoise?"
103,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_140","I heard faint voices coming from inside."
104,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_141","So it's not alone. But we're still going in, of course?"
105,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_142","This may be a trap. Be ready for a fight, everyone!"
106,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_145","This tunnel just keeps going..."
107,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_150","I'm not worried. We've had to improvise countless times before, after all."
108,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_KRILE_000_155","A device made with electrope. It seems to be the only one here."
109,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_GRAHATIA_000_160","It would appear no one has worked these tunnels in quite some time..."
110,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_170","I can hear them. Several people up ahead."
111,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_171","Hmm. I can't make out their conversation with the echoing."
112,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_172","Let's keep going. Stay on your guard."
113,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WUKLAMAT_000_180","I can't say I understand what's going on, but at least Cahciua is safe."
114,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ALISAIE_000_185","Erenville's mother is a floating machine. Right─that makes about as much sense as everything else thus far."
115,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_KRILE_000_190","At this point, I doubt anything could possibly surprise me."
116,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_GRAHATIA_000_195","The Allagans had machines that could be controlled remotely. Is she using something similar to communicate with us?"
117,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_GEODE_000_200","Always too much excitement with her... Sorry for drawing our weapons on you."
118,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_NOSTALGIA_000_205","If it's any consolation, this is all rather confusing to us as well."
119,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_WAYAKKWE_000_210","Oh, uh...hello."
120,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_CAHCIUA_000_215","Come, come, make yourselves comfortable!"
121,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_220","As far as I can tell, this is indeed my mother. I can think of few people in the world quite so spirited..."
122,"TEXT_KINGMD119_04930_ERENVILLE_000_221","But as to what's happened, we'll need to ask her..."
