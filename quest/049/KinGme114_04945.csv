1,"TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_01","Having tended to the aftermath of the massacre in Solution Nine, you and your allies now look to dealing with Zoraal Ja. In order to reach the summit of Everkeep where he awaits, you must climb your way through Origenics, the facility where souls are separated and refined for use. To that end, you follow Cahciua to your departure point at the driftdowns."
2,"TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_02","At the pier, Cahciua explains how the mission will unfold. When Origenics takes a scheduled delivery, you will steal inside aboard a hover cargo, and thence fight your way upwards. As you await departure, you see to your final preparations in anticipation of the facility's tight security.

※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
3,"TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_03","After an arduous climb that takes you past technology both extraordinary and disturbing, you finally arrive at the uppermost section of Origenics on Everkeep's eleventh floor. There you come upon a storage chamber for soul cells, but to your dismay, most are already spent of their contents─it would seem Zoraal Ja has wasted no time availing himself of their power. A sudden noise from behind causes alarm, but it quickly gives way to gladness as you make out the figures of Alphinaud, Y'shtola, and Estinien, who have entered the dome in order to lend you a hand. With your formidable crew thus assembled, you press onwards to the summit in search of Zoraal Ja.

※In the event that you leave the summit of Everkeep, you may return there by speaking with Kiluwsa at the driftdowns."
4,"TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_04","Ascending to the summit, instead of a twelfth level, you are shocked to find an enormous interdimensional portal hanging overhead in the open sky. Your immediate concern, however, is Zoraal Ja, who emerges from the blanket of clouds. A gasp escapes your lips when you see his tortured form, in the process of being twisted by the profusion of souls he has taken into himself. Wuk Lamat steps forward to challenge her brother, and thus begins the final battle between the siblings─between the Vow of Resolve of Tuliyollal and the King of Resolve of Alexandria─whose outcome will steer the course of the world...

5,"TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_05","Despite completing his transformation into a transcendent being, Zoraal Ja ultimately falls before your determined onslaught. Having told a teary Gulool Ja that he is free to embrace or spurn his legacy, he then breathes his last. As Wuk Lamat laments her brother's path, Sphene arrives and reveals that she still intends to plunder aether from other worlds in order to sustain the Endless, whom she insists are not dead. She takes up the object the king left behind, the key to interdimensional fusion, and sends it through the portal before closing it. In that instant, she disappears, having left you with the fervent declaration that she will stop at nothing in order to save her subjects─even should it demand that she become history's most brutal queen.

※In the event that you leave the summit of Everkeep, you may return there by speaking with Kiluwsa at the driftdowns."
6,"TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_06","In place of roiling storm clouds, a clear and empty sky now hangs over Everkeep. As all present stand silent, processing events, you turn to Y'shtola for what insights she may be able to offer.

※In the event that you leave the summit of Everkeep, you may return there by speaking with Kiluwsa at the driftdowns."
7,"TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_07","Y'shtola posits that Sphene's true form exists in the reflection beyond the portal, but with it closed, you cannot go after her. Hoping to find clues, she suggests examining Cahciua's vessel, which has ceased to function.

8,"TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_08","Erenville reveals his suspicion that Cahciua is in fact an Endless. Given the timing of her vessel's deactivation, she is likely in the same reflection as Sphene, to which you must find a way to travel if you are to prevent the queen from enacting her genocidal plan. While Y'shtola leads an investigation at the tower's summit, you are urged to head back below with Wuk Lamat and Gulool Ja to get some rest."
9,"TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_09","You join Wuk Lamat in the Backroom. She concedes to needing a rest, and having witnessed her exertions every step of the way, you are inclined to agree."
