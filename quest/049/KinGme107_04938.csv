80,"TEXT_KINGME107_04938_TAAPU_000_068","Should he in turn bare his heart to you, accept and respect his wishes. As Queen Sphene respected ours when she granted us a place in her realm."

82,"TEXT_KINGME107_04938_WUKLAMAT_110_068","But, uh...what do you mean when you say Sphene respected your wishes?"
