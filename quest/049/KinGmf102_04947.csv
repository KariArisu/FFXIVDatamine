54,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_WUKLAMAT_000_007","Y'shtola is heading back. I dare to hope she's found a way to pursue Sphene."

58,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_GRAHATIA_000_012","Aye. We believe we've found a way to travel to the reflection to where Sphene has retreated."
59,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_ALISAIE_000_013","I was busy providing aid in Solution Nine, so I haven't heard the details myself."
60,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_ALISAIE_000_014","Could you start from the beginning, Y'shtola?"
61,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_YSHTOLA_000_015","Per Sphene's own words, the gate atop Everkeep was opened and closed by the power of interdimensional fusion."
62,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_YSHTOLA_000_016","And it was the artifact known as the key that allowed her to control it."
63,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KRILE_000_017","According to Ketenramm, the key was brought with me to the Source twenty years ago."
64,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KRILE_000_018","It was then kept here in the palace until its theft by Zoraal Ja, who used it in Yyasulani to fuse a portion of our world with this reflection."
65,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_YSHTOLA_000_019","Following Zoraal Ja's demise, Sphene claimed the key and disappeared through the gate."
66,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_YSHTOLA_000_020","But where exactly did that gate lead? In seeking the answer, we took another look at Origenics─and made a startling discovery."
67,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_YSHTOLA_000_021","As you all know, there should have been one more level at the summit of Everkeep. "
68,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_ALISAIE_010_021","The twelfth level─the King of Resolve's royal abode."
69,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_SHALE_020_021","Right. But when you actually went there, you saw that it didn't exist."
70,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_SHALE_000_022","Curious, we analyzed Origenics's logs to see where the memories of the departed were being sent. And where should it be but <Emphasis>through</Emphasis> the gate, to the missing twelfth level."
71,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_YSHTOLA_000_023","That level alone must have lain outside the fused region, and so was left behind."
72,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_ALISAIE_000_024","Then it means..."
73,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_Q1_000_025","What will you say?"
74,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_A1_000_026","The reflection to which Sphene has fled is her own."
75,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_A1_000_027","Alphinaud, if you'd be so kind!"
76,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_YSHTOLA_000_028","Indeed."
77,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_YSHTOLA_000_029","'Tis Sphene's home world, and she has returned there, to join the memories of her departed citizens."
78,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_ALPHINAUD_000_030","It means that beyond the gate lies not just any reflection, but the one from which Alexandria originally hailed."
79,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_ALPHINAUD_000_031","'Tis Sphene's home world, and she has returned there, to join the memories of her departed citizens."
80,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_GRAHATIA_000_032","But as the key lies with her on the other side, we haven't the means to reopen the gate."
81,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_WUKLAMAT_000_033","Forgive me, but I thought we already knew she had gone home─or at least it seemed obvious to me. What I want to know is, how do we pursue Sphene if the gate here is closed?"
82,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KRILE_000_034","We use another gate. And it just so happens we know where one is."
83,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_ALISAIE_000_035","The Skydeep Cenote!"
84,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KRILE_000_036","Aye. All evidence suggests that the gate there leads to the world whence the Alexandrians and I came."
85,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_ALISAIE_000_037","But assuming that's true, how can we open it?"
86,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KRILE_000_038","That is what we shall find out, using the code in this earring."
87,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_SHALE_000_039","As you'll recall, Krile's earring is in fact a data storage device."
88,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_SHALE_000_040","An analysis of it yielded a code─something used to control a contraption, and a very large one at that."
89,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_GRAHATIA_000_041","Given the circumstances of Krile's arrival in the Source, we believe that said contraption is the gate to the golden city."
90,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_GRAHATIA_000_042","This is admittedly an educated guess, but we are quite hopeful that it will work."
91,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_WUKLAMAT_000_043","To make such progress in so short a time... You really are amazing!"
92,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_YSHTOLA_000_044","We couldn't have done it alone. The credit must go to the members of Oblivion for acquiring the information we needed, Shale especially."
93,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_WUKLAMAT_000_045","Right then, it seems the plan is set! To the Skydeep Cenote!"
94,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_GULOOLJA_000_020","Aren't we going yet?"
95,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_WUKLAMAT_000_025","I've told the officers of the Landsguard about my intention. They fully support our endeavor."
96,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KOANA_000_030","Begging your pardon, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but might I have a moment ere setting forth?"
97,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_WUKLAMAT_000_031","Oh, you're already going to give <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> the thing?"
98,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KOANA_000_032","Yes. I had thought to save it for later, but in light of these developments, I feel now is the time."
99,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KOANA_000_033","As Lamaty'i says, I have something for you. Please come with me to Bayside Bevy."
100,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_GULOOLJA_000_035","Are these all shops? It's so different from Solution Nine!"
101,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_WUKLAMAT_000_040","Hehe, I hope you like it!"
102,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KOANA_000_050","Tuliyollal is safe in no small part due to your valor. As a token of our appreciation, I have commissioned special equipment for you."
103,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KOANA_000_051","While it is inadequate as an expression of gratitude, I pray it will serve you well in your coming mission."
104,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_WUKLAMAT_000_052","It apparently incorporates foreign technology. Leave it to Koana to request such a thing, eh?"
105,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_KOANA_000_053","Mewazunte yonder has the equipment in his keeping. Just say the word, and he will bring it out."
106,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_SYSTEM_000_100","You may now obtain job-specific gear from Mewazunte."
107,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_SYSTEM_000_101","The weapons and gear obtained can be equipped at level 99. However, all item stats will be subject to item level sync."
108,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_SYSTEM_000_102","Upon reaching level 100 with the corresponding job, these items will no longer be synced."
109,"TEXT_KINGMF102_04947_SYSTEM_000_103","Furthermore, the gear can be dyed upon completion of the role quests associated with said job."
