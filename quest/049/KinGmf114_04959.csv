1,"TEXT_KINGMF114_04959_SEQ_01","The moment of reckoning is at hand. Interdimensional fusion has been initiated, meaning the Meso Terminal is now vulnerable. Determined to carry out Cahciua's plan, you make haste back to the terminal at the heart of the city."
2,"TEXT_KINGMF114_04959_SEQ_02","Unsurprisingly, one cannot simply shut down the Meso Terminal. In anticipation of this, Cahciua has left you with a program that will send your souls into its memory banks, where you are to seek out and stop Sphene. A virtual domain generated by her memories awaits, and dying there would mean dying in reality, but for the sake of the lives in all worlds, you must brave the dangers and see your mission through.

※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
3,"TEXT_KINGMF114_04959_SEQ_03","You fight your way through Sphene's lived memories, bearing witness to her past, to arrive at the innermost sector. All that remains is to confront your adversary and prevent her from harvesting life from other worlds.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with Erenville in Living Memory."
4,"TEXT_KINGMF114_04959_SEQ_04","At last you come face-to-face with Sphene, but not before her memories are expunged. Before your very eyes, the once-gentle queen is recreated as a terrifying entity, and she summarily expels your comrades before moving to erase you from existence. If you would protect all that you hold dear, your only choice now is to fight─and triumph.

※The Interphos can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
5,"TEXT_KINGMF114_04959_SEQ_05","At the end of a grueling struggle, you succeed in defeating the monstrosity Sphene had become. To your surprise, she then reappears as she once was, having been remade from her memories as an Endless. Deeply remorseful, she apologizes for all the suffering she has caused, and entrusts her burdens to Wuk Lamat before going to join her beloved people in oblivion's embrace."
6,"TEXT_KINGMF114_04959_SEQ_06","Together with your comrades, you make a triumphant return to Tuliyollal. Though much work remains to be done, the people again look to a brighter future.

You are resting in your cabin after the victory celebration when Wuk Lamat and Erenville pay you a visit. The Dawnservant thanks you for all that you have done for her nation, while the gleaner reveals that he has given up that calling, that he might fulfill his mother's dream of seeking discovery. And whatever your own plans may be, you are assured that you are a guest in Tuliyollal until you are ready to leave."
7,"TEXT_KINGMF114_04959_SEQ_07","So it is that your grand adventure in Tural comes to an end. When first you set out in search of the legendary city of gold, little did you imagine that you would discover it to be a twisted utopia. And though Sphene is no more, her hopes survive in Wuk Lamat, who shall watch over her beloved subjects as they rebuild their lives. With the cycle of life restored to Alexandria, its people will once more live and die as creation had intended, with the legacy of one generation being passed down to the next. Thus carrying the memories of those you met in your heart, you look to the journeys still ahead. As you continue walking your path, you may collide with others and your steps may falter. But come what may, you find encouragement in the knowledge that the world shall ever be filled with wonders awaiting discovery."
