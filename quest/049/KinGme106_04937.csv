1,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_SEQ_01","After a quick word with Tassos, you are shown through to the Backroom, the headquarters of Oblivion. There, Cahciua, Shale, and Genolt provide you with an overview of their operations, which include investigating Preservation, an organization credited with developing interdimensional fusion─the power which brought Alexandria to Tural. In the course of the conversation, Shale recognizes Krile's earring to be a data storage device. The manner in which Krile and the accessory arrived in the Source leads to speculation that her parents may in fact be the founders of Oblivion, and she is given permission to review data in the Backroom. While your other comrades are then engaged in various ways, you find yourself roped into lending Genolt a hand. Even now, he regards you with his unsettlingly familiar grin in anticipation of your aid...

※In the event that you leave the Backroom, you may re-enter by speaking with Tassos at the Neon Stein."
2,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_SEQ_02","Severely sleep-deprived but determined to do his work, Genolt tasks you with fetching his favorite energy tonic. He hands you vouchers that can be exchanged for two cans─one for him and one for you─which you are to collect from a man named Philomon on the main strip of True Vue."
3,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_SEQ_03","Upon finding Philomon, you are taken aback when he angrily denies selling energy tonics. His tone quickly changes, however, as he leans in and quietly tells you to give him the voucher."
4,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_SEQ_04","Philomon hands you the cans of energy tonic, with yours apparently formulated for beginners. This being your first time, he requires that you drink it in his presence in case there are side effects."
5,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_SEQ_05","You drink the energy tonic and experience transcendent alertness, all with seemingly no adverse effects. Satisfied that all is well, Philomon bids you return to the Backroom to deliver Genolt his tonic."
6,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_SEQ_06","No sooner do you put the tonic into Genolt's hand than he drains it in one pull. The effect is immediate and intense, and the man resumes his work with newfound vigor. Having completed your little errand, you turn to join Wuk Lamat in conversation with Cahciua."
7,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_SEQ_07","Cahciua confirms your suspicions: the blue-scaled Hoobigo child is most certainly Zoraal Ja's son. Named Gulool Ja by Cahciua after she found him, he was abandoned at an early age and prefers to be on his own. As his aunt, Wuk Lamat expresses her desire to take him in, but when she mentions her objective of killing his father, you are alerted to the sound of fleeing footfalls. To everyone's dismay, it appears that Gulool Ja was eavesdropping. Desperate to explain herself to her nephew, Wuk Lamat will set out to find him, and you and Alisaie will help search outside Everkeep."

54,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_ALISAIE_000_020","A little. Try to keep closer to the rest of us so you don't get surrounded."
55,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_CAHCIUA_000_025","This place was originally designed by a Preservation engineer. That's why it's wall-to-wall with contraptions."

58,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_GENOLT_000_060","Sorry ye had to see me passions spillin' over. Happens when ye put yer heart an' soul into yer craft, ye know?"
59,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_GENOLT_000_061","An' not to be weird or nothin', but I felt a sense o' kinship when I saw ye. As if we've met in another life..."
60,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_GENOLT_000_062","Anyroad! As I was sayin', I need someone to lend me a hand."
61,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_GENOLT_000_063","I haven't slept fer two nights now─not a single wink─an' I'm ripe to collapse."

71,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_PHILOMON_000_091","Here you go. Yours is formulated for beginners. Gentler than the full-strength stuff."
72,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_PHILOMON_000_092","It's not contraband or anything, so you won't run afoul of the authorities. But if the Rhodina Consortium was made aware of my special selection, it'd be bad for business."
73,"TEXT_KINGME106_04937_PHILOMON_000_093","Now, seeing as it's your first time, I want you to drink your tonic here. Just in case there're side effects."
