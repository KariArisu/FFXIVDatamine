1,"TEXT_KINGLA501_04996_SEQ_01","Fish Fancies Donuhanu is a unique-yet-unprofitable emporium of the finned and bizarre. The eponymous monger would have your help in fishing his enterprise out of hot water, but though his love for fantastical catches is genuine, his business sense seems sadly lacking. Luckily for him, his reputation as an odd fish has not left him friendless, and a fisher asks for his assistance with some matter or another down at the docks."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA501_04996_SEQ_02","The fisher leads you to a man in blue, who introduces himself as Pashenine, a member of the Whalaqee. He has come seeking a strong fish with which to slay a giant toad as part of a rite of passage paramount to his people─and Donuhanu is all too eager to help. Marveling at the ability of fate to bring kindred souls together, you follow them back to Fish Fancies Donuhanu."
3,"TEXT_KINGLA501_04996_SEQ_03","Distracted from his shop's dim prospects for the moment, Donuhanu plunges himself into the task at hand, wracking his brain for the strongest fish he can come up with. You stand by, eager for him to point you in a direction, because the waters of Tural are teeming with fish, and you are ready to cast your line."
