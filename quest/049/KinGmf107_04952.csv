1,"TEXT_KINGMF107_04952_SEQ_01","Having encountered an Endless incarnation of Ser Otis Velona in Yesterland, Wuk Lamat is eager to speak further with him. Thus do you set off towards the air cab station, where he appeared to have been bound."
2,"TEXT_KINGMF107_04952_SEQ_02","You find Otis rehearsing the lines for the upcoming Founding Celebration play, which tells the tale of the realm's birth. The knight reveals that, due to there being fewer Endless, it has become difficult to gather a crowd. To that end, he tasks you and Wuk Lamat with spreading word of the production to the younglings of Yesterland, for which he will provide child-pleasing animal costumes for the both of you to wear."
3,"TEXT_KINGMF107_04952_SEQ_03","You don your costume and assume the guise of a friendly rabbit. As per Otis's instructions, you turn your attention to the children in the vicinity of the air cab station.

※You must be wearing the costume provided by Otis to complete this task. Speak with him again to prolong or restore the guise."
4,"TEXT_KINGMF107_04952_SEQ_04","You have told a good number of children about the play. Satisfied with your efforts, you make your way back to Otis."
5,"TEXT_KINGMF107_04952_SEQ_05","Having thanked you for promoting the production, Otis now asks you to perform a duel in it. Though Wuk Lamat is reluctant at first, your enthusiasm wins her over, and together you make your way to Proto Alexandria to prepare."
6,"TEXT_KINGMF107_04952_SEQ_06","At last the play begins, and you perform your parts with aplomb. But when Otis takes the stage for his own, he is overcome by the memories of failing to protect his queen and freezes still. Fortunately, the day is saved when Wuk Lamat launches into an inspired improvisation which brings the tale to a satisfying conclusion.

Afterwards, when you finally manage to have a quiet moment with Otis, you reveal to him that you are in fact living people. Answering his questions, you tell him that Alexandria endures, and that his other self served the realm valiantly. Comforted by this knowledge, the knight declares that he may rest easy, his newfound peace comforting you in turn as you press on to the Geo Terminal."
7,"TEXT_KINGMF107_04952_SEQ_07","Wuk Lamat shuts down the terminal, causing the Endless in Yesterland to fade away. Her time here has impressed upon her how much Sphene's people loved her and yearned for peace, and she swears to carry it all with her."
