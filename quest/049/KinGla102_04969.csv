The farmer soon arrives to retrieve their order, and is so pleased with the quality of your work that she thanks both you and Papawni directly. Evidently, this is Papawni's first time to be shown gratitude by a customer, and she is moved by the experience. Rral Soj asks that you continue to lend your assistance until Papawni has a better handle on the tasks required of her."

73,"TEXT_KINGLA102_04969_PAPAWNI_000_058","I did, but an intermediary took care of transactions, so I never actually met a customer face-to-face. B-Believe it or not, this is the first time..."
