※Minimum collectability rating for this delivery is 210. Delivering items with a rating of 430 or more will earn greater rewards."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_SEQ_02","You deliver the tortilla presses to Rral Soj. Aunt Tii soon arrives to pick them up, and is pleased to see her bulk order was finished in time─no thanks to Papawni, unfortunately, who was so fixated on crafting a flawless press, that she only managed to make a single one. It seems Rral Soj will still need your help for now."

54,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_RRALSOJ_000_016","What? You've never heard o' Aunt Tii's Tacos? It's one o' the most popular taco places in the city."
55,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_PAPAWNI_000_017","I see... But are tortilla presses normally ordered in bulk? Surely her stock didn't break all at once...?"
56,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_RRALSOJ_000_018","This is somethin' of a special case. Seems the manufactory in charge o' Tii's tortilla production's havin' a complete overhaul, and everythin' needs replaced─spares included. She wants us to prepare as many presses as possible."
57,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_RRALSOJ_100_018","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I'd like you to make six o' 'em. Papawni and I'll handle the remainder."
58,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_RRALSOJ_000_019","Tii entrusted this order to my shop 'cause she has faith we'll get the job done in a timely fashion. Let's show her what we're made of."

60,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_PAPAWNI_000_030","As I understand, the most crucial factor is to ensure each tortilla is pressed to a uniform size... This may require some metalworking wizardry!"
61,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_RRALSOJ_000_040","I'll be hard at work craftin' my share o' presses when I get a spare moment from tendin' the shop. Soon as you have your share ready, just say the word."

63,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_RRALSOJ_000_051","Ah, finished already, have you? This has jus' the right amount o' weightiness to it, an' the surfaces look perfectly flat. I daresay Tii will steal whatever competition is left with the tortillas she makes from these."

66,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_TIISOLJA_000_062","We'd been using only hardwood presses at the manufactory till now, but I can't tell you how many times I've had to order replacements. The things seem to break at the slightest bit of force! Having metal presses will be a huge relief."
67,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_RRALSOJ_100_062","I promise you these can take a beatin', and then some."
68,"TEXT_KINGLA103_04970_TIISOLJA_000_063","Oh, I don't doubt it! And, seeing as you've proven yourself a woman of your word, you'll be the first person I come to for my cooking supplies from now on!"
