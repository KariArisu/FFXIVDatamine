Although he is scarce on the details, he pledges that working for the shop will be a pleasant and fruitful experience. Shunye's Apothecary can be found at the far end of the marketplace, and the proprietor is always there to speak with customers─or prospective talent."

He explains a recent lack of proper materials has caused business to stagnate but then brightens when you offer your services. Your conversation is interrupted by the arrival of a Viera who introduces himself as Uvlo, who explains that he has traveled from Othard to learn about the Shetona tribe. Sensing an end to his troubles, Shunye proposes a test of your respective abilities. May you gather the best of what Tural has to offer!"

60,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_SHUNYE_000_014","To put it simply, I purvey in goods which promote a healthy body and mind. Herbs to cleanse mild ailments, incense to calm the senses, stones to massage aching shoulders, and much more, as you can see."

74,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_UVLO_000_028","I...have no money."
75,"TEXT_KINGLA401_04989_UVLO_000_029","Not even a single coin. I spent my very last one hiring a ship to bring me here."
