54,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_014","We believe so."

58,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_SHALE_000_018","While the king and queen's residence is believed to be located there, the details are highly classified. Hence the lack of map data."
59,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_019","We do, however, have reliable intelligence concerning everything up to the eleventh level."
60,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_GRAHATIA_000_020","What is this place?"
61,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_021","That is Origenics, the facility where souls are separated and refined for use."
62,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_022","The process begins at the base with the extraction of souls from regulators and fiends."
63,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_023","Those souls are then transported up to the aetheric separator, where they are cleansed of memories."
64,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_024","Finally, they are packed within soul cells for distribution."
65,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_GRAHATIA_000_025","Twelve forfend... They've recreated the process by which souls are broken down in the aetherial sea..."
66,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_026","An affront to nature, I know, but ethical discussions must wait."
67,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_027","The salient point is that the facility extends vertically from the first to the eleventh level."
68,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_028","Now, if Zoraal Ja intends to strengthen himself with the people's souls, as we strongly suspect..."
69,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_KRILE_000_029","Then the facility will be operating to process and transport those souls directly to him─on the twelfth level!"
70,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_KRILE_000_030","So in order to reach Zoraal Ja, we make our way through Origenics!"
71,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_031","Precisely."
72,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_032","As the facility sustains the Alexandrian way of life, security will be extremely tight."
73,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_033","But if you are willing to brave the route, we'll back you up as best we can. What say you?"
74,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_WUKLAMAT_000_034","It goes without saying that we're going!"
75,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_035","<chuckle> I never had any doubt."
76,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_036","I'm coming too. You'll need guidance on-site, and this body makes me best suited."

78,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_ERENVILLE_000_038","All this time, you've known that Sphene is an Endless, haven't you?"

80,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_ERENVILLE_000_040","Why didn't you tell us?"
81,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_041","Honestly...it didn't seem relevant to the matters at hand? More complicated to explain than it was worth, and a distraction from our efforts to deal with Zoraal Ja."
82,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_042","Speaking of which, we should get moving. Those who are sallying forth, we gather in front of the tower!"
83,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_043","We can count on you to provide support from here, yes?"
84,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_ERENVILLE_000_044","...Of course."
85,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_ERENVILLE_000_050","I need to talk to you about... Never mind. It can wait."
86,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_ERENVILLE_000_051","Lest you wonder, I have no objections to remaining here. Someone needs to keep those in Tuliyollal informed."
87,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_ERENVILLE_000_052","Best of luck to you."
88,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_WUKLAMAT_000_060","Zoraal Ja is no king. Not anymore. For the sake of Tuliyollal─of the world─we must put an end to his madness."
89,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_ALISAIE_000_065","I've spoken with Alphinaud. Apparently, the dragons came to Tuliyollal's aid!"
90,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_KRILE_000_070","I'm coming too, of course. This is what I've worked so hard to be a part of."
91,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_GRAHATIA_000_075","The summit of Everkeep... Finally, we shall see what the clouds conceal."
92,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_080","All present and accounted for? Excellent."
93,"TEXT_KINGME113_04944_CAHCIUA_000_081","We make for the summit in one push. This will be a grueling climb, so see to it you spare no preparation."
