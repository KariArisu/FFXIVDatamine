54,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_022","I considered the possibility."
55,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_023","But when my brother told me to come and prove myself, he meant it."
56,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_024","He wants to show that his kingdom is superior to Tuliyollal, and it'll give him no satisfaction to attack when he knows I'm not there."

58,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_ALISAIE_000_026","Indeed... If anything, we're more likely to put Tuliyollal in danger by not taking the fight to him."
59,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_KRILE_000_027","So we indulge Zoraal Ja. At least, until Tuliyollal has shored up its defenses."
60,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_028","Right. We'll charge in from the front and keep his eyes on us."

68,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_KRILE_000_037","Shenza has given me a list of materials. We'll see to it they have everything they need!"

73,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_042","As I understand it, the two of you met your fair share of craftsmen during the rite of succession."

77,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_046","Perhaps my greatest concern is keeping the train safe from enemy attacks."
78,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_047","Even with you all aboard to fend them off, it'd be over in an instant if they managed to get just one good hit on the ceruleum tanks."
79,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_048","According to eyewitnesses, the soldiers use lightning-based weapons, so I've a mind to install grounding rods. Would you happen to know a carpenter who could handle that?"
80,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
81,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_A1_000_001","We could ask Wuk Evu."
82,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_A1_000_002","We could ask the fellow with a fetish for formalities."
83,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_050","A master carpenter from Ok'hanu, eh? If they'd be willing, we'd be glad to have them."
84,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_051","No objections from me. Just be sure not to forget their traditional greeting..."
85,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_052","Heh, you mean Wuk Evu. While he has his quirks, there's no questioning his carpentry!"
86,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_053","A master carpenter from Ok'hanu, eh? If they'd be willing, we'd be glad to have them."
87,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_054","But we'll need more than just a carpenter if we want this done in a timely fashion."
88,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_055","We've got a lot of equipment that needs moving. <Emphasis>Heavy</Emphasis> equipment. I don't suppose you know anyone up to the task?"

90,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_A2_000_001","Perhaps Fonjeantaine can help."
91,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_A2_000_002","Perhaps Zurmurwur can help."
92,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_057","Fonjeantaine? That's...certainly a choice."
93,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_058","But I wouldn't exactly call him strong. For a task like this, I think we should ask someone like, say, Zurmurwur."
94,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_059","You're friends with the Yok Huy? I'll be damned. We'll not want for strength with help like that."
95,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_060","Zurmurwur would be perfect! We'd be hard-pressed to find folks stronger than the Yok Huy, and I'm sure he'd be willing to help."
96,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_061","You're friends with the Yok Huy? I'll be damned. We'll not want for strength with help like that."
97,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_062","Next, I'd like to outfit the train with some powerful weaponry of its own."
98,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_063","Like as not, the soldiers will be riding their flying vessels. We'll need countermeasures to deal with them."
99,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_064","That's true... I for one can't use magic, nor am I handy with a firearm like my brother."
100,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_065","Any ideas for ranged weapons we can use?"
101,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_Q3_000_000","What will you say?"
102,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_A3_000_001","Let's borrow guns from Koana for everyone!"
103,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_A3_000_002","Let's install ballistas on the train! Big ones!"
104,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_067","Guns, eh? While they'd be suitable in theory, it takes no ordinary marksman to hit a flying target."
105,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_068","So it'd need to be something that doesn't require that level of skill and precision. But weapons aren't exactly my field of expertise..."
106,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_069","Ballistas, eh? While they'd be powerful, it seems to me it'd take too long to reload between shots."
107,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_070","If there were some sort of ballista that could reload quickly, then that might work. But weapons aren't exactly my field of expertise..."
108,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_GRAHATIA_000_071","Perhaps I can be of assistance."
109,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_GRAHATIA_000_072","The Crystarium employed aetheric cannons for its defenses, and I see no reason why the design cannot be adopted for your train."
110,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_GRAHATIA_000_073","While I did not conceive them myself, I know their design. It should be possible to build them here, provided we have the requisite materials and skilled smiths."
111,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_074","Now, that sounds like something Fonjeantaine can help with. What are the materials we need?"
112,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_GRAHATIA_000_075","The barrel can be fashioned from any metal, so long as it's highly conductive to aether. To power the cannon, we will require fire-aspected crystals of the highest purity."
113,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_076","Fire crystals, eh? Might be as the miners over at the Springs can help with that."
114,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_GRAHATIA_000_077","Then if I could leave the crystals and smiths in everyone's hands, I shall get started drawing up the schematics."
115,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_078","Right then, I'll secure us the smiths."
116,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_100_078","In the meantime, could you deal with the materials? Shenza is in charge of our supplies, so it might be good to talk to him about it first."
117,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_079","Well, I think we're set for a plan! Thanks for the consultation!"
118,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WAWLIKA_000_080","Now let's get this train dressed up, and give her the proper farewell she deserves!"
119,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_GRAHATIA_000_085","Right. Time to put my knowledge gained in the First to use."
120,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_090","Hehe, the plan's coming together!"
121,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_091","To make good speed, I'm going to try and enlist some more help from among our friends back in Yok Tural."
122,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_WUKLAMAT_000_092","I'll leave the materials in your care. I think I saw Shenza over to the southeast."
123,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_SHENZA_000_100","That should be enough lumber for the armor. What else do we need...?"
124,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_SHENZA_000_101","Oh! Sorry, I didn't see you there. What can I do for you?"
125,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_SHENZA_000_102","Aetheric cannons? Interesting. I have an idea where we can get the conductive metal, so I'll take care of it."
126,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_SHENZA_000_103","I'm not sure about the fire crystals, though. Might be best if you spoke directly with a miner. Can I leave that to you?"

128,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_SHENZA_000_105","You're friends with Iyaate, aren't you? One of the best miners around. If anyone can get you the crystals you're after, it's her."

130,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_IYAATE_000_120","Oh, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. What brings you around these parts?"
131,"TEXT_KINGMD113_04924_IYAATE_000_121","The purest fire crystals, you say?"
