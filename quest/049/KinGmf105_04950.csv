68,"TEXT_KINGMF105_04950_EUCLASE_000_048","(-Euclase-)Even then, our reunion wasn't yet to be, for the aether shortage means not everyone can be recreated. I had to wait until but recently to see her again."

115,"TEXT_KINGMF105_04950_CAHCIUA_000_128","Well, that's enough about me for now. While we wait for Krile and Elene'shpya, I have a favor to ask of you."
116,"TEXT_KINGMF105_04950_CAHCIUA_000_129","As you may have noticed, most of the fountains here aren't running. That's because, despite its shiny appearance, this city is centuries old and everything is dreadfully run-down."
117,"TEXT_KINGMF105_04950_CAHCIUA_000_130","The fountains apparently used to put on magnificent shows, and I was hoping that we could get them working again."
