49,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_PAMEKA_000_002","Zemoweni said he had Pelupelu tales to tell us next, correct?"
50,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_PAMEKA_000_003","In which case, I thought using materials sourced from the Pelupelu's ancestral home of Urqopacha might give our cover an authentic touch."
51,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_PAMEKA_100_003","A book about any given peoples should look at home amongst them, or so I think."
52,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_PAMEKA_000_004","Then it's settled. I trust you'll know just what local materials we need."

54,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_PAMEKA_000_100","We'll require local materials from Urqopacha for our book of Pelupelu tales. Did you find anything?"
55,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_PAMEKA_000_101","Simple and rugged...quite like the mountainous terrain of Urqopacha itself! I am eager to see the finished product."
56,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_PAMEKA_000_102","Oho! Your elegant use of snow cotton has not gone unnoticed. With it, your cover is <Emphasis>bound</Emphasis> to radiate Pelupelu spirit!"
57,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_103","Today, I'd like to share a few stories about the Pelupelu. These days we know them to be avid travelers and seekers of profit, but this was not always so."
58,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_104","Long before this nation was founded, the Pelupelu were a reclusive folk who rarely left the solitude of Urqopacha..."
59,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_105","Now, in one solitary village, there lived a Pelupelu named Cibli. The poor lad was sickly and short of stature─even compared to his diminutive fellows."
60,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_106","With such a frail constitution, Cibli could neither work in the fields nor tend to the alpacas."
61,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_107","But the village loved him even so, and he loved them in turn. They nursed him back to health in his times of need and offered tasks that would not fatigue him. He only wished he could better serve them."
62,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_108","Yet kindness cannot solve all ills─and in the year of the cold summer, crops withered upon the mountains of Urqopacha. The Pelupelu began to starve..."
63,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_109","They ate what remained of their food. They ate all their frail livestock. Cibli knew that they had reached their limits and snuck quietly from the village."
64,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_110","With one less mouth to feed, his people would have more to eat. Finally, he had found a way to help!"
65,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_100_110","His mind made up, the poor Pelu made for the sacred mount, that he might fade from this world in its silence."
66,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_111","As he began to climb, a spirit appeared and forbade him to go any further. Cibli begged the spirit to let him pass and spoke about his village."
67,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_112","The spirit was moved by the lad's fervent resolve, and bestowed unto him a handful of leaves. “Return to your village,” it said. “Your people must drink of these leaves.”"
68,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_113","Cibli obeyed and steeped the leaves in hot water. When his people drank, their hunger miraculously faded. No Pelupelu succumbed to famine, and they all lived to see the coming year. So it was that the Pelupelu first encountered mate tea..."
69,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_114","Another impeccable book! Thank you, both of you."
70,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
71,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_A1_000_001","What a peculiar story."
72,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_A1_000_002","Do spirits like that really exist...?"
73,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_116","Of course, there's no telling whether it actually happened. But mate tea <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> rich in nutrients, and I've heard it's effective in relieving hunger as well."
74,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_117","I wonder. But more important than the tale's veracity is its continued importance in Pelupelu culture, I think."
75,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_PAMEKA_000_118","To me, the moral seems to lie in the virtue of caring for one another. That even in times of great difficulty, keeping others in your heart can lead to unexpected solutions."
76,"TEXT_KINGLA203_04977_ZEMOWENI_000_119","Well, I'd better be off... I still have some reading and writing practice to do. But next time, I think I'll share some tales from our Moblin customers. See you then!"
