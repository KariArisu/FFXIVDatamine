1,"TEXT_KINGMC108_04904_SEQ_01","In the interest of time and safety, your group splits into pairs to search for the elector. You can only hope the people's reception of outsiders is not as bad as Hunmu Rruk predicted..."
2,"TEXT_KINGMC108_04904_SEQ_02","You are staunchly ignored and avoided by the citizens you attempt to speak to. Perhaps Wuk Lamat fared better."
3,"TEXT_KINGMC108_04904_SEQ_03","Wuk Lamat's experience was strikingly similar to your own. However, she spots what looks like a market nearby─and those endeavoring to earn coin may be more inclined to lend an ear."
4,"TEXT_KINGMC108_04904_SEQ_04","You are called away from another fruitless attempt at communication by Alphinaud, who urges everyone to join him with all haste. You arrive in time to watch Zoraal Ja bend knee to a hulking shadow of his father─a shade which subsequently vanishes into smoke, revealing the elector of Mamook, Zereel Ja. The elector chastises the First Promise for attempting to obtain the keystone by force after being bested in battle, and for this violation, he is disqualified from the rite of succession.

Zoraal Ja has no sooner left the stage than Bakool Ja Ja arrives, a homecoming that turns sour in an instant. When he discovers Bakool Ja Ja has not only failed to make progress in the rite, but suffered defeat at the hands of Wuk Lamat, Zereel Ja banishes him, casting aside his own son as he might a broken tool. The elector of Mamook then turns his gaze to the remaining claimants, who he is eager to engage in the Feat of the Brotherhood, an ultimate test of strength against the most formidable of blessed siblings─a foe he is confident they will be unable to overcome. Wuk Lamat refuses, however, stating that she must learn more about Mamook first. Hearing this, the woman standing beside Zereel Ja approaches Wuk Lamat and whispers that she wishes to speak in private..."
5,"TEXT_KINGMC108_04904_SEQ_05","As no locals have shown any inclination towards speaking with outsiders thus far, the woman who left with Zereel Ja may be your only opportunity to learn anything substantial about Mamook. Wuk Lamat sets out to meet her west of the city as requested."
6,"TEXT_KINGMC108_04904_SEQ_06","The woman introduces herself as Miilal Ja, and explains that Mamook has become a cloister for devotees of blessed siblings. Only two-headed Mamool Ja are worthy of ruling Tuliyollal─or so they fervently believe. But Miilal Ja and others reject this tradition, and want nothing more than to convince their brethren of its senselessness. But what is the terrible price they have paid for their zealotry which has moved her to seek your aid?"
