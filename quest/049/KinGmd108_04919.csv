1,"TEXT_KINGMD108_04919_SEQ_01","Rather than remain idle, Erenville suggests moving the timber somewhere more easily accessible. You brace your back and prepare for a little heavy lifting."
2,"TEXT_KINGMD108_04919_SEQ_02","With a heave and a ho, you take up a crate full to bursting with timber. Thankfully the main road is not terribly far."
3,"TEXT_KINGMD108_04919_SEQ_03","No sooner do you set down the last of the timber than Wawlika arrives with Shenza, Zawpya, and a rroneek in tow. They insist you go and wait at the train station while they see to the timber's delivery."
4,"TEXT_KINGMD108_04919_SEQ_04","Erenville welcomes you back to the station, hopeful that you have had your fill of the sights of Shaaloani. He invites you to wait with him and watch the train as it departs."
5,"TEXT_KINGMD108_04919_SEQ_05","The skies over Shaaloani suddenly grow dark, and with a thunderous boom a giant dome appears in the distance. A moment later, flying warships emerge from its murky depths, and upon realizing that they are heading for Tuliyollal, you and Erenville hasten back to the capital. You arrive in a city embroiled in chaos, with mysterious soldiers in the streets slaughtering innocents seemingly at random. Once reunited with Wuk Lamat, the Dawnservant explains that the enemy forces appeared out of nowhere and attacked without provocation. Together with Erenville, the three of you make your way towards the palace, and there find Gulool Ja Ja locked in mortal combat with a transformed Zoraal Ja. The hardened warrior proves no match for his father, but through the use of an unknown power, he not only revives himself, but manages to deal Gulool Ja Ja a fatal blow.

※In the event that you leave the area and wish to return, speak with the Landsguard gatekeeper at the entrance to Sunperch."
6,"TEXT_KINGMD108_04919_SEQ_06","A hush falls over the throne room as all present realize Gulool Ja Ja is moments from his end. It remains to be seen if aught can be done to save the former Dawnservant..."
