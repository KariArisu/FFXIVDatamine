The individual is so pleased by their quality that they return with Rral Soj, both to thank everyone involved in their creation and to request that the three of you craft something for the royal family. Rral Soj heartily accepts the request, and should it become official, this will be XRral Soj Metalwares first royal appointment. The proprietress asks that you stay just a bit longer, as this could be a turning point for her store."

54,"TEXT_KINGLA106_04973_RRALSOJ_000_023","I heard through an ol' acquaintance that a palace seer was looking for an artisan to craft a censer for their ceremonial practices. Told 'em I'd be happy to oblige."
55,"TEXT_KINGLA106_04973_PAPAWNI_000_024","It'd be a trifle to craft were it a simple censer, but seeing as it's for ritual use, I believe it will require delicate and precise ornamentation."
56,"TEXT_KINGLA106_04973_PAPAWNI_000_025","Which is why Mistress Rral Soj and I have decided to split up the task thus: she shall prepare the molds, while I oversee the censers' decoration and finishing touches."

58,"TEXT_KINGLA106_04973_RRALSOJ_000_027","The design o' censers where you're from may look different from those in the palace, but a quality work is a quality work. I'm confident the seer will be happy to use any that an artisan of your talent can make."
59,"TEXT_KINGLA106_04973_PAPAWNI_000_040","Much as Mistress Rral Soj said, this will be a dance of sorts. Once she prepares a mold, I shall see to its ornamentation. In the meantime, she'll begin preparing the next mold, and so our “dance” will continue."
60,"TEXT_KINGLA106_04973_RRALSOJ_000_050","Countin' on you for those censers. As they're for ceremonial use, they'll need to be not only easy to employ, but elaborate in design as well."

70,"TEXT_KINGLA106_04973_BOONEWAPRIEST04973_000_077","I've never seen censers of such marvelous make in all my days at the palace. Not only do they function perfectly, but each one is simply exquisite. They are most beautifully designed."
