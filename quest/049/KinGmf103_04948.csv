1,"TEXT_KINGMF103_04948_SEQ_01","It has been determined that the gate of the golden city likely leads to Sphene's home reflection. The Queen of Reason has all but certainly retreated there, and in order to find her and thwart her plot, you and your comrades set forth for the Skydeep Cenote."
2,"TEXT_KINGMF103_04948_SEQ_02","At the entrance to the cenote's inner chamber, Wuk Lamat cannot help but be struck by a pang of nostalgia for the journey thus far. The others join in sharing their feelings before you all proceed inside."
3,"TEXT_KINGMF103_04948_SEQ_03","So it is that you come before the enigmatic gate to the golden city once more. You take your places as Krile prepares to see if her earring is indeed the key to lifting the seal. In conjunction with the authority Gulool Ja inherited from his late father, the earring serves to open the gate and reveal a portal to another reflection. With the way forward thus secured, it is decided that you, Wuk Lamat, Krile, G'raha Tia, and Erenville will be the ones to sally forth, and you gird yourselves as you regard the golden light into which you must step.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return via the inner chamber of the Skydeep Cenote."
4,"TEXT_KINGMF103_04948_SEQ_04","With the portal's protection entrusted to your companions, you sally forth unto the unknown reflection that Wuk Lamat has dubbed the unlost world."
5,"TEXT_KINGMF103_04948_SEQ_05","Mere moments after entering the portal, you emerge on the other side. Your breath catches in your throat as the scenery comes into view─a sprawling, dazzling city that could only be described as the legend of the golden city come to life."
6,"TEXT_KINGMF103_04948_SEQ_06","Having composed yourselves after the initial awe, you set about exploring your surrounds. Wuk Lamat suggests following a nearby path to see where it leads."
7,"TEXT_KINGMF103_04948_SEQ_07","As you and your comrades observe that the city is likely Alexandrian, you are approached by an Endless named Constancy. Introducing himself as a guide, he explains that the city is called Living Memory, and it was originally a recreational attraction for ordinary people before being repurposed as a haven for Endless. When Wuk Lamat indicates your desire to see Sphene, he advises you to seek her out at the Meso Terminal at the center of the city."
8,"TEXT_KINGMF103_04948_SEQ_08","Sphene appears upon being called at the Meso Terminal, and Wuk Lamat pleads for her to reconsider her course. Alas, the queen refuses to be swayed and vanishes again, but not before revealing that she will erase the memories she has as a living person, that she might shed with conscience to become a devourer of worlds."
9,"TEXT_KINGMF103_04948_SEQ_09","Wuk Lamat is dejected that she could not reason with Sphene. As you hear your friend's frustration, you find yourself wondering about the true nature of the Endless, and why Sphene goes to such lengths to protect them."
