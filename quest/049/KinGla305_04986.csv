1,"TEXT_KINGLA305_04986_SEQ_01","After three successful prototypes, Xeerol Ja reveals her most ambitious desire yet: blending a beverage for the Pelupelu, expert brewers themselves. Their mate tea already serves as a popular source of nutrition, but Xeerol Ja suggests a trip to Wachunpelo to see if any hidden health concerns are plaguing the Pelupelu. "
2,"TEXT_KINGLA305_04986_SEQ_02","Upon your arrival in Wachunpelo, Halnaruk expresses his eagerness to exchange tongueflaps with the locals. Surely someone will have the insights you need to conceive a worthy concoction."
3,"TEXT_KINGLA305_04986_SEQ_03","You learn about the history of several classic Pelupelu beverages. How this information might serve your own juicemaking endeavor remains to be seen, but Xeerol Ja's arrival in Wachunpelo is imminent. Maybe she will have some ideas."
4,"TEXT_KINGLA305_04986_SEQ_04","Thus far, it seems nothing you've managed to glean from the locals has led Xeerol Ja to a juicy epiphany. Still, it's possible Halnaruk might have found a lead...whether he realizes it or not. "
5,"TEXT_KINGLA305_04986_SEQ_05","Halnaruk's discovery is that of a Pelupelu experiencing all the symptoms of someone who drank too much mezcal. Xeerol Ja sends the fellow on his way with a glass of water and lecture on the virtues of hydration, but not before he misunderstands her concerns as one of a physician. Halnaruk is all too eager to support the flattering claims, insisting that Xeerol Ja is every bit the healer she once aspired to be, but these words bring her no joy. She confesses that the reason she never became a chirurgeon was due to her utter lack of magical talents─an unthinkable handicap for a member of the Boonewa clan. She can never achieve her dreams because she is inherently broken; and with such a declaration, Xeerol Ja excuses herself, her head hung in shame."
6,"TEXT_KINGLA305_04986_SEQ_06","As much as Halnaruk regrets his thoughtless words, he's determined to lift Xeerol Ja's spirits. From his bulging pack, he produces a kukuru pod and bids you make some delicious kukuru pulp juice from it. Here's hoping the finished product tastes better than the name sounds...

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Halnaruk."
7,"TEXT_KINGLA305_04986_SEQ_07","Xeerol Ja gratefully accepts the kukuru pulp juice and marvels at the taste, wondering why something so soothing is not a more popular beverage in the city. Halnaruk explains that kukuru beans are more highly valued than their pods since they create chocolate─but he vows never to underestimate a kukuru pod again. Both have their strengths, regardless of societal opinion. Taking his meaning, Xeerol Ja's eyes brighten and she resolves to keep trying, for the sake of her customers and for the sake of Xeerol Ja Juicecraft. It's back to Tuliyollal with the lot of you─there are drinks to be made!"
8,"TEXT_KINGLA305_04986_SEQ_08","Back in her own shop, Xeerol Ja seems more motivated than ever to develop a drink for the Pelupelu. Research takes time, however, so you may have to wait until she has more juicy details to spill..."
