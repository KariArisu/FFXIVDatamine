1,"TEXT_KINGMC106_04902_SEQ_01","After divulging the truth of his relation to Wuk Lamat, Hunmu Rruk requests a moment to compose himself. You return to the Garden of the Stars, leaving the Xbr'aax Rax alone with his thoughts."
2,"TEXT_KINGMC106_04902_SEQ_02","No sooner do you rejoin Wuk Lamat than one of Bakool Ja Ja's minions arrives to escort Wuk Lamat to an undisclosed location for purposes unknown. Whatever it is, it cannot be good, so Wuk Lamat answers this summons with you as her second. Thus are you led to the Xobr'it Cinderfield, where you discover that a swaggering Bakool Ja Ja holds hostage Hunmu Rruk─whom he exposes as Wuk Lamat's birth father. The elector's release is contingent upon Wuk Lamat placing her keystones on the line and triumphing over Bakool Ja Ja in single combat. All you can do is trust in your friend as she attempts to settle the score with her tormentor once and for all..."
3,"TEXT_KINGMC106_04902_SEQ_03","Bakool Ja Ja brings to bear the full wrath of blessed siblings, but to little effect. Unable to tolerate the impending defeat of their fearless leader, lackeys and bandits who have tied their fate to the two-headed claimant join the fray─yet Wuk Lamat stands firm. Out of options and out of strength, Bakool Ja Ja flees into the forest, abandoning his prisoner.

Before Wuk Lamat can confirm the truth of her heritage, Hunmu Rruk diverts the conversation, praising her strength as Gulool Ja Ja's daughter. His eyes bespeak a kindness and resolution to leave other words unsaid, which Wuk Lamat no doubt sees as well. Though you cannot know her heart, her smile says enough."
4,"TEXT_KINGMC106_04902_SEQ_04","Wuk Lamat has proven to both herself and the world that even when forced to stand alone, she is capable of protecting what is precious to her. Whatever the final feat demands, it is clear that she can rise to the occasion."
