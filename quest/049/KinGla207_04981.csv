1,"TEXT_KINGLA207_04981_SEQ_01","Pameka is glad for your presence, but regretfully informs you that there has been no word from Zemoweni about his next commission. Curious as to his storytelling duties at Xbalyav Ty'e, your scrivener friend suggests you pay him a visit at his workplace."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA207_04981_SEQ_02","At Xbalyav Ty'e, Zemoweni admits his intention to commission Pameka again─this time for a book of tales from his homeland. His dilemma, however, stems from the fact that a written work may not properly represent a Tonawawta village that adheres to an oral tradition. Recalling the power of illustration, Pameka proposes the next book be one that incorporates different media to fully tell the tale within. With Zemoweni's materials from Xak Tural in hand, you set out to craft a binding worthy of his people's stories.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Zemoweni."
3,"TEXT_KINGLA207_04981_SEQ_03","After you deliver the components to Pameka, she begins transcribing Zemoweni's tale.

4,"TEXT_KINGLA207_04981_SEQ_04","At Xbalyav Ty'e, Zemoweni gathers the crowd's attention with the promise of a new story and begins reading from the book you bound him.

5,"TEXT_KINGLA207_04981_SEQ_05","Zemoweni's smile is equal parts relief and gratitude, still breathless from his long tale. He suggests you seek out Pameka, who has already returned to her stall."
6,"TEXT_KINGLA207_04981_SEQ_06","Pameka reflects upon her time with you and Zemoweni, reporting a new appreciation for the power of words both written and spoken. Theirs is the power to carry one generation's hopes to the next, and she vows to improve upon her skills as a scrivener and endeavor to transfer the full weight of her client's words to parchment as best she can. She thanks you for your help and brings to the final page your endeavors as book-binder─but one small tale among the many of Wachumeqimeqi."
