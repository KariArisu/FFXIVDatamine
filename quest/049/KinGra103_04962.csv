1,"TEXT_KINGRA103_04962_SEQ_01","Your second foe is Honey B. Lovely, who is known to wield both poison and the pheromones of a queen bee to charm her enemies in battle. While Black Cat has some reservations about how you might fare in the coming clash, Metem has full faith that you will claim victory.

※AAC Light-heavyweight M2 can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA103_04962_SEQ_02","After dodging a veritable maelstrom of charms, groupbees, and more, you have defeated Honey B. Lovely─who increasingly seemed more like Honey B. Angry as the fight went on. No doubt Metem will be pleased by this latest achievement.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA103_04962_SEQ_03","Having won two matches in a row, your next bout will be against the champion of the light-heavyweight tier, but certain arrangements must be made before the match can begin. Metem suggests you find yourself a “second” in the meantime, which inspires Black Cat to ask if she can fulfill this responsibility for you. Since she appears eager to work with you, and you have no other apparent alternatives, you decide to accept her request. Now acting as your second, she reveals that her real name is Yaana."

52,"TEXT_KINGRA103_04962_METEM_000_102","As you can doubtless guess, she utilizes the soul of a bee─and an extremely venomous one at that. But rather than her poison, you should be wary of her ability to charm all before her."
53,"TEXT_KINGRA103_04962_METEM_000_103","For in addition to her winsome charm, which serves her well as a songstress, she can produce the pheromones of a queen bee to enthrall even her foes. Those who fall under her spell delight in the torment she unleashes upon them."
54,"TEXT_KINGRA103_04962_METEM_100_103","Which is why the audience will be spectating via special contraptions cloaked in holograms. It wouldn't do to have hundreds of people be enthralled."

61,"TEXT_KINGRA103_04962_METEM_000_132","With this victory, you're now eligible to challenge the reigning champion of the light-heavyweight division. And as eager as I am to see you claim the crown, it will take some time to make arrangements for the match."
62,"TEXT_KINGRA103_04962_METEM_000_133","While you wait, why not find yourself a “second”? That is, someone who supports you by gathering information on your opponents and giving advice on your training."
