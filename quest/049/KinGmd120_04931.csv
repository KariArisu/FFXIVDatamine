77,"TEXT_KINGMD120_04931_GEODE_000_030","The first, as the name suggests, is the regulation of the wearer's reserve of souls. Should they die, the regulator expends a soul to bring them back to life."

88,"TEXT_KINGMD120_04931_GEODE_000_041","The regulators are constantly recording the memories of their wearer, so if they should suddenly die, their memories can be refreshed as part of the restoration process."
89,"TEXT_KINGMD120_04931_GEODE_000_042","This is how they preserve one's identity and sense of self. However, the regulators are also triggered when someone else dies."
90,"TEXT_KINGMD120_04931_GEODE_000_043","Reason being is that regulators forcibly extract memories relating to the deceased from anyone wearing one."

97,"TEXT_KINGMD120_04931_GEODE_000_050","It's then delivered to a facility where memories are separated from the soul."

99,"TEXT_KINGMD120_04931_CAHCIUA_000_052","Meanwhile, the memories are stored in the core system. To be “remembered” forever."

103,"TEXT_KINGMD120_04931_GEODE_000_056","Amidst the mounting death toll, scientists used electrope to devise a means to save what lives they could so that the nation could endure."
104,"TEXT_KINGMD120_04931_WUKLAMAT_000_057","I understand the people of Alexandria did what they believed was best to save their people. I just find it hard to believe the Turali would also accept this way of living."
