1,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_SEQ_01","For you and Erenville, the time has come to embark on a new adventure in the northern reaches of Tural. To that end, the gleaner bids you speak with the sentry standing near the gate leading out of the city. Once you show him your travel pass, you can be on your way."
2,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_SEQ_02","You present your travel pass to the sentry, who proceeds to open the gates and grant you and Erenville passage to Xak Tural. On the other side of the great bridge you find arid wilds stretching out before you. Thus do you begin your journey into Shaaloani with Erenville as your guide."
3,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_SEQ_03","Erenville believes traveling by train will be the swiftest way to reach his home, Yyasulani, and he suggests riding rroneek to the station. Thankfully, there is a stable nearby where you should be able to secure mounts. "
4,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_SEQ_04","The stablekeep regretfully informs you that he does not have rroneek to spare for your trip. At least, not at present. He wishes to see you safely to your destination, and so he asks that you wait a short while until he can prepare mounts for the both of you. To pass the intervening time, Erenville suggests going to the nearby town of Hhusatahwi."
5,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_SEQ_05","No sooner do you enter town than the commotion from a nearby tavern draws your attention. Two men step outside, one chasing after the other, and their heated exchange seems likely to escalate into violence until the timely intervention of a familiar bystander, Estinien. You and the dragoon exchange pleasantries, but he departs as quickly as he arrived, leaving you and Erenville to reflect upon recent events."
6,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_SEQ_06","As Erenville explains it, Shaaloani was once a lawless place where differences were often resolved through duels. To preserve the peace without having to resort to conflict, the Dustwatch was founded, likely at the behest of those who share in Koana's vision of a modern Tural. Knowing your history of solving problems through strength of arms, Erenville urges you to remain on your best behavior, lest you find yourself in one of their jails."

60,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_034","They're usually so docile, and the ones I saw earlier didn't appear to be unhealthy, either. But much has changed since last I was here..."

62,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_036","Still, the train station isn't far. Seeing as we aren't in a hurry, let's go on foot."
63,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_RRONEEKLENDERA_000_037","About that, sir. As well traveled as you look, it's not only the rroneek that've been givin' us trouble. Other wildlife have shown signs of aggression, too."
64,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_RRONEEKLENDERA_000_038","A merchant should be returnin' soon with one of our beasts. Stick around till they do, and I'll see you both on rroneek for a safer trip."

72,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_RRONEEKLENDERA_000_043","Hahaha! If this is your first time in Shaaloani, I can understand your enthusiasm. It'd be a shame not to ride one at least once while you're here."
73,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_044","A fair point. If we're to give you the “authentic Shaaloani experience,” I suppose it's worth the wait."

76,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_047","Right, change of plans. There's a small town nearby. We can pass the time there while waiting."
77,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_RRONEEKLENDERA_000_048","Take it you're headin' to Hhusatahwi, then. I'll have a man bring the rroneek over there."

79,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_RRONEEKLENDERA_000_050","Won't take long, rest assured. Keep an eye out for a man in Hhusatahwi with two rroneek."

82,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_071","This Dustwatch has their work cut out for them. For as long as I can remember, all disputes big or small were settled by dueling."
83,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_072","The peoples of Shaaloani rarely saw eye to eye. And for better or worse, it was the simplest way to settle differences."
84,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_073","Since most would sooner not risk their lives, though, it encouraged parties to pursue peaceful resolutions in a roundabout fashion."
85,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_074","The Dustwatch was likely established by supporters of Koana, preferring peace be enforced through the formal rule of law."
86,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_075","A reasonable stance, all things considered. If things ever got out of hand, the Landsguard would be forced to step in. What freedom they have now would be lost under Zoraal Ja's authority."
87,"TEXT_KINGMD101_04912_ERENVILLE_000_076","All of which is to say that, unless a lengthy stay in a jailhouse appeals to you, be mindful of how you handle your arms in town."
