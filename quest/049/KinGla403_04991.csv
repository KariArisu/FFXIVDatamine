※Shunye's Apothecary spiritual supplements can be gathered near the House of Winds High by miners, and near Ok'hanu by botanists.

※Minimum collectability rating for this delivery is 240. Delivering items with a rating of 600 or more will earn greater rewards."

Uvlo explains that his people live among harsh mountains and have developed a talent for mining. He reveals that he is acting as an emissary of his village, and aims to eventually return to his people to share his acquired knowledge of the outside world. The Shetona are of particular interest to him, being a people so far apart, yet so similar to his own. Shunye is pleased to learn more of his employee, and asks you to return again when your hands are free."
