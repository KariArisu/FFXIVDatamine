50,"TEXT_KINGME104_04935_WUKLAMAT_000_011","Look, you obviously have duties to attend to─citizens to look after. We can stop here if you like."
51,"TEXT_KINGME104_04935_SPHENE_000_012","No, no. I do this because I want to, so please do not worry."
52,"TEXT_KINGME104_04935_SPHENE_000_013","Next, I'll show you one of the district's most vital facilities, a place called Resolution. To reach it, we'll need to go by way of leynode nine, where the aetheryte is situated."

64,"TEXT_KINGME104_04935_WUKLAMAT_000_036","Well, it can wait for another time. We've been exploring for a while now and should probably go to Cahciua's meeting point. "
