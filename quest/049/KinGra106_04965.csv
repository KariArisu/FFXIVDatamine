1,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_SEQ_01","With a special exhibition match against Wicked Thunder now decided, you can see the conflict in Yaana's eyes. Yet she quickly recovers from her thoughts, declaring that while Eutrope is her sister, she's your second. She once more reviews the neoteric witch's fighting style for you, and then wishes you luck in your upcoming bout. An electrifying clash is sure to ensue.

2,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_SEQ_02","Though you prevail against Wicked Thunder, the levinsteed-empowered fighter who can bend electrope to her will, she manages to escape in a sudden flash of lightning. An anxious Yaana surely awaits you in the greenroom.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_SEQ_03","Yaana is genuinely impressed that you managed to claim victory over her sister, but appears troubled that she disappeared yet again. As it will be some time before matches in the next tier begin, she suggests you both return to Tritails Training."
4,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_SEQ_04","The witch for a new age reveals a shocking truth: the extended use of feral souls causes an affliction called psychonekrosis, a fatal ailment which eats away at one's soul. Eutrope herself suffers from the illness, and seemingly wishes for Yaana to leave the Arcadion so she does not succumb to the same fate. The only cure, according to Eutrope, is the exceedingly dense soul of a person─such as yours. Metem suddenly arrives however, prompting the Arcadion fugitive to flee. The stylish commentator urges you to become the grand champion, that you may release all the souls in the repository without arousing the president's suspicion."
5,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_SEQ_05","Yaana is thankful she has you by her side as she goes through this difficult time. She's of a mind to continue acting as your second, while otherwise working with Neyuni to investigate an alternative cure for Eutrope. Though cruiserweight matches have yet to begin, a cartoonist named Gabbro is quite interested to hear a direct account of your battles in the Arcadion, and Yaana believes it would be worth your while to speak with him."

66,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_EUTROPE_000_106","Because if you repeatedly transfigure your flesh with a feral soul, you'll eventually develop psychonekrosis─an irreversible disease where your own soul degrades."

75,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_EUTROPE_000_114","I feared I would become another victim if I remained. And so I disappeared, and began searching for a cure to the illness."

77,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_EUTROPE_000_116","In theory, the remedy is another person's soul, but an ordinary one won't do. No, it has to be surpassingly dense."

84,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_METEM_000_123","Forgive my intrusion. I'd come to see how you were faring after your sister's sudden appearance...but I fear I've overheard something most distressing."

88,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_METEM_000_127","Oh no, that is the worst thing we could possibly do! The president shows no mercy to those who get in his way!"
89,"TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_METEM_000_128","Should we go public with his secret, no one would be safe. Not you or me or any of the fighters. That Eutrope has kept silent, I suspect, is because she understood this."
