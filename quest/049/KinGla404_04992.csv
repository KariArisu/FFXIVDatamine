79,"TEXT_KINGLA404_04992_UVLO_000_061","You said these “cleanse” your homes. How, exactly? Do they keep insects away? Or perhaps they keep the floors clean?"
80,"TEXT_KINGLA404_04992_SHUNYE_000_062","Indeed, they do serve such purposes, but more importantly, they're essential to upholding Shetona customs."

85,"TEXT_KINGLA404_04992_SHUNYE_000_067","We fell trees only when absolutely necessary, or else live in the natural shelter of caves. Some of our small settlements even make use of buildings abandoned by other peoples."

87,"TEXT_KINGLA404_04992_SHUNYE_000_069","Nowadays, Shetona are not an uncommon sight even in a metropolis like Tuliyollal. Some even consider embracing change to be a part of nature's flow."

89,"TEXT_KINGLA404_04992_UVLO_000_071","I see... I suppose these supplies are a way of allowing nature's blessing into your homes and maintaining your connection to its cycle."
90,"TEXT_KINGLA404_04992_SHUNYE_000_072","Exactly. Saca sage is native to the wilderness of Shaaloani and is purported to be closely linked to the greater power flowing around us, which lends it potent cleansing properties."
91,"TEXT_KINGLA404_04992_SHUNYE_000_073","Niikwerepi feeds into several bodies of water, Lake Toari among them. Such water passes through countless valleys and under vast reaches of sky, and connects us to that unfathomable journey."

93,"TEXT_KINGLA404_04992_SHUNYE_000_075","After her children set off on their own journeys, she settled down in Tuliyollal with a new family. But she still maintains a strong connection to the natural energies she was once surrounded by."
