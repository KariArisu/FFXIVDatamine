55,"TEXT_KINGMD110_04921_A1_100_002","It looks like a person, but it's clearly mechanical."
56,"TEXT_KINGMD110_04921_ALISAIE_000_012","Indeed... While it resembles a person, it has features that make it uncanny, the lack of a face not least of all. Did you see any sign of a power source?"
57,"TEXT_KINGMD110_04921_ALISAIE_000_013","So it probably doesn't run on ceruleum or any other conventional fuels."
58,"TEXT_KINGMD110_04921_ALISAIE_000_014","I tried channeling aether into it earlier, but there was no response. That would seem to rule it out as an arcane entity."

60,"TEXT_KINGMD110_04921_ALISAIE_000_016","Even the material it's made of is a mystery. Rather than a metal, it's more akin to stone... Wait. Haven't we seen this somewhere recently?"

65,"TEXT_KINGMD110_04921_ALISAIE_000_019","Uh, yes, it certainly is. But it's nothing like what was used to craft this machine."

67,"TEXT_KINGMD110_04921_ALISAIE_000_021","And while the soldiers are a different color, the warships are the same black as the stone of the gate itself."
