50,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_000_006","Tuliyollal gets far more sunlight than our native lands, so we find ourselves prone to dry, itchy scales. It can be sheer torture some days!"
51,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_000_007","Luckily, the cherimoya fruit harvested from Urqopacha may offer a solution. According to Pelupelu merchants, regular consumption does wonders for dry skin."
52,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_000_008","The only complication is that, in appearance and texture, cherimoya very much resembles Mamool Ja scales. Hard to garner appetite for something that looks like a piece of your body."
53,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_000_009","If it were any other fruit, I'd think to extract the liquid from within─but not only is most of cherimoya's flavor kept in its pulp, its nutrients are as well. "
54,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_000_011","Perhaps you can find a way around this conundrum, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? See if you can't make a cherimoya juice both healing and appetizing to Mamool Ja!"
55,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_100_011","Now, I'm afraid I don't keep cherimoya on hand─the sight alone is enough to make me queasy─but I've seen it for sale in Bayside Bevy."
56,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_000_012","We'll be testing for flavor and efficacy both, so make a big batch if you can─six glasses or so. Thank you, and good luck!"

67,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_000_022","Exquisite! Thick with the cherimoya's signature sweetness and aroma, yet utterly smooth in texture!"
68,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_000_023","No one would ever guess this juice came from a fruit so wholly unappetizing in appearance..."
69,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_000_024","Yes, I can safely say that no Mamool Ja could find qualms with this beverage─I myself would happily drink it daily. And with its nutritional benefits, peeling scales may become a thing of the past!"

72,"TEXT_KINGLA302_04983_XEEROLJA_100_026","Can I interest you in a glass, Halnaruk? I'd love to hear what Moblins think of cherimoya's flavor."
