1,"TEXT_KINGMF109_04954_SEQ_01","As fate would have it, Krile has been reunited with her mother and father, Alayla and Robor. While uncertain how she should interact with her long-lost parents, with your support and encouragement, she sets off for the heatwells to make the most of this chance to be with them."
2,"TEXT_KINGMF109_04954_SEQ_02","Krile and her parents' initial attempts to get acquainted prove awkward. As you observe their struggles, inspired by her experiences with xibruq pibil, Wuk Lamat offers to bring them food in a bid to break the ice. Alayla requests something cold, and you turn to your comrades to discuss options."
3,"TEXT_KINGMF109_04954_SEQ_03","As this is a special moment, it is decided that you will look for a treat that will leave an impression. The search begins with asking locals for recommendations, and you make your way to leynode pyro to question the Endless there."
4,"TEXT_KINGMF109_04954_SEQ_04","The answers you receive point you to a stall southwest of the leynode, which apparently offers something called gold star ice cream. Without delay, you set forth in search of it."
5,"TEXT_KINGMF109_04954_SEQ_05","You arrive at the stall to find Wuk Lamat also eyeing it. The ice cream looks duly impressive if cumbersome, but confident in your transporting skills, you volunteer to deliver all three servings to Krile and her parents."
6,"TEXT_KINGMF109_04954_SEQ_06","You have picked up the servings of gold star ice cream. Stepping quickly but lightly, you begin making your way back to Opal Springs."
7,"TEXT_KINGMF109_04954_SEQ_07","You deliver the ice cream intact, but even with the delightful treats, the awkward air persists between Krile and her parents. Thankfully, the ice is finally broken when G'raha Tia makes an artful intervention, and genuine smiles manifest upon the faces of all present.

At the meal's conclusion, Krile's parents tell you about interdimensional fusion. The key for invoking the power is a relic that belonged to their people, the Milalla, who employed it in the distant past to flee to another reality when a great calamity froze their homeland. When lightning then threatened this world, Robor and Alayla attempted to invoke the power once more, but were unable to do so. In desperation, they agreed to cooperate with Preservation only to discover that the order sought to siphon aether from other worlds. This led to the couple's defection, and in the course of fleeing pursuit, they brought their only daughter to the Source to keep her safe. So it is that Krile comes to know the truth of her origin, and in order to learn more about the Milalla, you decide to visit the cavern inside the volcano, where their ancient homeland has been recreated."
8,"TEXT_KINGMF109_04954_SEQ_08","Standing at the entrance to the cavern, Krile expresses her heartfelt gratitude to you all. Thanks to your intervention, she was able to not only bond with her parents, but know the joy of sharing a meal with them besides."
