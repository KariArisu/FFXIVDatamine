1,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_SEQ_01","You barely step foot out the doors of the Arcadion before a crowd surrounds you, eager to praise─and deride─the upstart who quickly made a name for themself. Yet Yaana does not go unnoticed either, as one disgruntled fan heckles her for consorting with the competitor who defeated her, instead wistfully singing the praises of her sister, Wicked Thunder. Seeing no end to the crowd's badgering, you and Yaana break into a run in order to slip away. Eventually, you reach the entrance of Tritails Training."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_SEQ_02","Inside, you meet Neyuni, Yaana's precocious younger sister. The pair impart to you that their mother and father were hunters who died in the midst of one of their expeditions, and thus their elder sister, Eutrope, took it upon herself to look after them. Joining the Arcadion, she became a fighter, climbed the ranks, and eventually rose to the heavyweight tier, only to suddenly disappear one day─right before she was due to be immortalized. Having shown you a glimpse of their past, Yaana informs you the time of your next match is nigh, and so you depart for the Arcadion once more.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_SEQ_03","Yaana is ecstatic to begin acting as your second. Your match against the champion of the light-heavyweight division is nigh, and you can only hope you are prepared."

50,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_EXCITABLEMAN_000_101","To not only fight, but <Emphasis>win</Emphasis> without using a feral soul... You're absolutely amazing! I'll be cheering for you from now on!"

56,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_GABBRO_000_107","(-Genial Gentleman-)Ah, but do excuse me. I'm something of a storyteller, and I have a keen interest in seeing how this championship unfolds. When you have a moment, I would love to ask you a few questions."
57,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_DISSATISFIEDMAN_000_108","Wait, you're Black Cat! What are you doing, keeping company with the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>bloke</If> who just beat you!?"

59,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_110","This is never-ending. Let's get out of here."
60,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_111","Looks like we managed to slip away. Come on, the gym's just over here."
61,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_120","And here it is. Tritails Training, the home of Alexandria's finest fighters! That being said, I'm the only one here at the moment..."
62,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_121","It's also my actual home. The first floor is where I live, and the basement is where I train. Now don't be shy, go on in and make yourself comfortable!"
63,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_000_200","It's a pleasure to meet you, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>mister</If>! My name is Neyuni. Thank you very much for looking after my sister!"
64,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_201","Thanking <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> for knocking me out, are you?"
65,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_202","Anyway, as you may have pieced together, I have two sisters. And though they're gone now, our parents were originally from Tural."
66,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_000_203","They happened to be in Yyasulani when the dome appeared, and ended up trapped."
67,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_000_204","Here they took up work as hunters, but they were always opposed to regulators and never wore them. And one day, they went out and never came back..."
68,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_205","Truth be told, I became interested in you because you reminded me of our parents. Like them, you're averse to using souls."
69,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_206","We, on the other hand, don't see such a problem with the practice. So at our sister's urging, we started wearing regulators after Mother and Father died."
70,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_207","It's only because they weren't wearing regulators when they passed that we can still remember them. Whether we're better or worse off for it, I can't say..."
71,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_000_208","I was too little to understand when it happened, but I've heard the story from my sisters. So when I see you fight, I can't help but feel anxious."
72,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_000_209","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I say this knowing your stance, but won't you consider wearing a regulator in matches? If only to revive yourself should the worst come to pass."
73,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_210","I'm afraid you can't change people's minds when it comes to soul use, Neyuni. It's a question of culture and upbringing."
74,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_211","But rather than talk about such things..."
75,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_212","We should celebrate! You've won two championship matches now, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─this calls for drinks! We've only got energy tonics, but it's the gesture that counts, right?"
76,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_000_213","You're celebrating even though you lost...?"
77,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_214","So, after what that <Emphasis>delightful</Emphasis> fan said outside earlier, I imagine you're curious about my sister."
78,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_215","Her name's Eutrope, and she rose to be a top contender in the heavyweight division. She became a fighter to look after me and Neyuni first and foremost, but it turned out she was great at it."
79,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_216","Hardly surprising, I suppose. She always excelled at anything she set her mind on. She was a natural at combat, and on top of that she mastered how to wield electrope."
80,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_100_216","Hold on, I've just the thing."
81,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_000_217","Wicked Thunder was her ring name. She harnessed the levinsteed's soul in conjunction with electrope, and could shapeshift to adapt to her enemies in battle."
82,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_218","I'm confident enough in what I can do─Eutrope herself taught me how to fight─but I could never emulate her fighting style."
83,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_219","The thing is, she just disappeared one day, without saying a word to us."
84,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_000_220","She was so close to being immortalized, too."
85,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_221","Right, you wouldn't know. All Arcadion fighters retire young. Feral soul transfiguration is just too much of a burden on the body."
86,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_222","Those who fight to the age of twenty are immortalized in the Ascension Arcadia Hall of Fame. This comes with the privilege of moving to the luxury residences on Everkeep's upper level, where they can live out their days in comfort."
87,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_223","Eutrope threw all of that away when she vanished. I just can't wrap my head around why..."
88,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_YAANA_000_224","But that's enough reminiscing for now. It can't be long now before your next match, so let's head back to the Arcadion."
89,"TEXT_KINGRA104_04963_NEYUNI_000_225","Good luck, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! And please, be careful..."
