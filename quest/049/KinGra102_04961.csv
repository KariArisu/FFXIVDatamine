1,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_SEQ_01","You are introduced to your first opponent, Black Cat─the very same prideful girl whom you met earlier. Metem explains that she uses the soul of Cath Palug, a legendary feline said to have fought an ancient hero of their world. Once utilized, her claws will grow sharp enough to rend steel, and her agility will be unmatched. You will need to remain on your toes if you are to come out of this match the winner.

2,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_SEQ_02","After a grueling bout against the lithesome rookie, you have emerged victorious. Metem will no doubt be eager to speak with you.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_SEQ_03","Metem explains the history of the Ascension Arcadia Championship, and you learn that the contest existed well before Turali people arrived in Alexandria. He has barely finished his explanation when Black Cat emerges, frustrated that she lost to you. In an unexpected twist, she indicates her interest in learning more about you and your strength. You decide to allow her to stick around and observe your progress through the championship."
4,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_SEQ_04","Metem implores you to overlook Black Cat's so-called fickle behavior. You intend to do so for the time being, yet you cannot help but wonder what changes her presence might bring to the fold."

49,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_000","Now, I shall introduce your first opponent. Pray look at the monitor."
50,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_001","This here is Black Cat, feared as the claw in the dark!"
51,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_002","That's right, she's the one who took your measure earlier. While she's still a rookie herself, you'd be wise not to underestimate her. She has real talent and is expected to go far."
52,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_003","Her feral soul is Cath Palug, a terrible feline said to have pushed a legendary hero to his limits."
53,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_004","With its power, she becomes unimaginably nimble, and her very claws can rend steel. You'll need to keep your wits about you."
54,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_005","Now, you should know that the ring is uniquely configured to complement the fighting style of your foes."
55,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_006","This is in order to provide the audience with a spectacle. After all, we're first and foremost in the business of entertaining!"
56,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_007","On a similar note, I should mention that I'm also the commentator for matches. Leave it to me to squeeze every drop of excitement out of your fight!"
57,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_008","Now then, you had best see to your preparations. May you emerge victorious in your debut!"
58,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_100","Bravo, bravo! You were simply magnificent out there!"
59,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_101","The president's eye for talent is keen as ever."
60,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_102","So, now that you have your first victory under your belt, I shall tell you more about the Arcadion."
61,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_103","The championship traces its roots to a time in Alexandria long before the coming of the Turali people."
62,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_104","It was very different in the beginning, though, with matches pitting recreated simulacra against each other."
63,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_105","That's right─the very same that fought at your side. But with the advent of soul-derived resuscitation, battles to the death between living combatants became the norm─and all without any actual deaths."
64,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_106","The contest evolved once more after Zoraal Ja was made king. It was he who proposed the use of feral souls to enhance one's flesh, leading to the technology for it being devised."
65,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_107","So it was that combatants took on the power and likeness of beasts, and the audience experienced newfound heights of excitement!"
66,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_108","However, when Zoraal Ja raised the banners of war to embark on his conquest, all feral souls were reserved for the army's use. We had no choice but to suspend operations at the Arcadion."
67,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_109","What happened afterwards, I believe you know. Having gone mad, the king was vanquished by your hands, and shortly thereafter, our beloved queen was taken from us... Though we are thankfully safe now, sadness and uncertainty darken our hearts..."
68,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_110","Some may think it in poor taste to resume the championship now of all times, but it is now most of all that the people need cheering up. And as I mentioned when first we spoke, we wish to help them forget their cares."
69,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_111","Did you see how the audience roared when you, the upstart challenger, triumphed over our rising rookie? You have captured their imaginations, and I hope you will continue to do so!"
70,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_YAANA_000_112","(-Black Cat-)Ugh, I can't believe I lost to someone who wasn't even using a feral soul! What are you!?"
71,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_YAANA_000_113","(-Black Cat-)Damn it all! I can't leave things like this..."
72,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_YAANA_000_114","(-Black Cat-)Say, would you mind if I watched you for a while? Don't worry, I don't have any hard feelings. I'm just curious, that's all─about what you can do."
73,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_Q3_000_000","What will you say?"
74,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_A3_000_001","Be my guest."
75,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_A3_000_002","As long as you don't get underfoot."
76,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_YAANA_000_120","Don't mind me. I'm just going to be watching you quietly."
77,"TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_METEM_000_130","As fickle as a feline, that one... But I do hope you won't hold it against her. Deep down, she has a good heart."
