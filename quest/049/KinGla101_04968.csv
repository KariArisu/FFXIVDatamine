1,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_SEQ_01","Rral Soj, the eponymous proprietor of XRral Soj Metalwares, welcomes the arrival of a seasoned artisan at her shop. She explains that she recently hired an employee named Papawni, who seems to have difficulty with carrying out even the simplest of tasks. Before realizing this, however, Rral Soj had accepted a hefty bulk order, and was in danger of not fulfilling in time─until you showed up. She asks that you find Papawni, who was tasked with purchasing supplies in Bayside Bevy, and bring her back to the shop."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_SEQ_02","You find a troubled Papawni near a fountain in Bayside Bevy, and discover that she's a former potsworn whom you previously crossed paths with in Earthenshire. She shares the sad story of her failure to procure supplies for crafting a pot, explaining that in all her years as an artisan, she had never needed to purchase raw materials. Although initially dismayed that you were hired to pick up her slack, she realizes that another skilled crafter can only help her learn more quickly, and affirms her desire to relearn the basics. With her spirits recovered, Papawni bids you both return to meet the proprietress as she had requested."
3,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_SEQ_03","Although startled to learn Papawni lacked even the knowledge to forge such a simple tool, Rral Soj nevertheless decides to press on, and is ready to discuss a hefty bulk order she has lined up."

49,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_RRALSOJ_000_001","It's a pleasure. Name's Rral Soj, and I'm the proprietor of this here shop. From pots to knives, if it's used on the daily and made o' metal, I smith it."
50,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_RRALSOJ_000_002","There's one code I live by, and it's to never keep a customer waitin'. Soon as an order comes in, I do my damndest to have it ready soon as able. Can't have folks livin' their lives without the proper utensils, see?"
51,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_RRALSOJ_000_003","Won't say that speed don't come at a price. My goods come quality assured, but they ain't always pretty to look at."

58,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_RRALSOJ_000_011","But that Papawni, bless her heart... She's earnest to a fault, but the girl barely knows her way around a pitchfork, let alone a forge."
59,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_RRALSOJ_000_012","I've already accepted a hefty order, and I'm afraid we won't have it ready in time. I don't wanna let any one o' my customers down. So I ask you, will you lend me a hand? You'll be well compensated for your work, promise."

65,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_RRALSOJ_000_015","We'd best begin with introductions, then. Might I trouble you to fetch Papawni? I sent her to Bayside Bevy to purchase materials for pots some time ago, but she hasn't returned."
66,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_RRALSOJ_000_020","I gave her the simple task o' purchasing supplies, but she's been gone for quite some time now. Bring her back with you if you see her in Bayside Bevy, would you?"
67,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_030","Wait... You're one of the Third Promise's companions, aren't you?"
68,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_031","You may not recall, but we actually passed by one another in Earthenshire! I'm Papawni, a former potsworn. I'm honored to finally meet you!"
69,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_032","Gosh, do I miss how the Moblins spoiled us artisans. They provided every luxury you could imagine─a cot fluffier than alpaca fleece, platters of delectable food...best of all, they took care of all the cleaning, letting us focus wholeheartedly on our work!"
70,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_033","Alas, the storm left them short of supplies and helphands. I realized that the environment I once enjoyed there would not soon return, and made the hard choice to end my potpact and journey here for work."
71,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_034","Ah, but look at me─we've hardly met and I'm already talking your ear off! Excuse me. What brings <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> to this corner of Tural?"

75,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_038","As a potsworn, my work was quite intricate, you see. The Moblins desired only the most lavish and ornate novelties, so that is what I made. I can't even imagine where to begin making <Emphasis>household goods</Emphasis>..."
76,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_039","Not even a pot. <sigh> I spent more time than I care to admit in front of the supplier, trying to guess which materials might be appropriate for forging one until I just felt utterly overwhelmed...and wound up here."
77,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_040","Ugh, confounded by a <Emphasis>pot</Emphasis>. I'm no artisan─I'm a fraud."
78,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_041","You know, most people aren't even aware that the potsworn exist. Even bringing it up as a credential here only seems to garner doubt. I feel as if I've begged for work from every shop in Tuliyollal, but none would hire me."
79,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_100_041","No one but Mistress Rral Soj... She knew no more of the potsworn than anyone else, but she welcomed me with open arms instead of disbelief. I want to repay her compassion─her faith in me."
80,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_042","So I will! This isn't the time to be moping! I even have a new friend beside me! I can simply relearn the basics─starting with the materials for a pot!"
81,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_043","But first things first: we should return to Mistress Rral Soj as she requested!"
82,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_PAPAWNI_000_050","I see... Among the materials available in Tuliyollal, ingots smelted from Turali iron ore are most suitable in the forging of a pot!"
83,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_RRALSOJ_000_060","Thanks for bringing her back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. To think Papawni didn't even know the makings of a pot..."
84,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_RRALSOJ_000_061","<sigh> But that can come later. Now that you're both here, I'd like to discuss the bulk order we have lined up. I'll fill you in once you're ready, so just give me a shout."
85,"TEXT_KINGLA101_04968_SYSTEM_000_070","You may now undertake deliveries for XRral Soj Metalwares. Speak with Rral Soj to learn more."
