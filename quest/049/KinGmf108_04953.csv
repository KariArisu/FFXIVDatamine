52,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_010","So far there appears to be no change with the Meso Terminal."
53,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_011","So let's take the opportunity to visit another zone: Asyle Volcane, in the northeast."
54,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_012","The place with the volcano, eh? And I suppose we're using the zip line again."
55,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_013","You know it. Like before, I'll take care of the guard at the Gate of Remembrance. Come, let's head back."
56,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_KRILE_000_014","That's a fiery place indeed... I wonder what it's themed upon."
57,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_GRAHATIA_000_015","I must say, it saddens me to see the scenery change in our wake."
58,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_ERENVILLE_000_016","How can she be so carefree about everything...?"
59,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_017","That volcano <Emphasis>really</Emphasis> isn't real, right? All that smoke pouring out is just part of the glamour?"

64,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_110_020","N-Not on your life! I-It isn't even real, is it?"
65,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_021","Oh, definitely not. But don't take my word for it─jump in and see for yourself."
66,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_022","N-No need. I-I believe you."
67,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_023","That there is the terminal."
68,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_100_023","You can get to it via the caverns that run through the volcano."
69,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_024","I'll go on ahead and wait for you. Take care around the wildlife, now!"
70,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_025","Hey, Erenville?"
71,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_ERENVILLE_000_026","I'll explore alone. You needn't worry─I'll give the wildlife a wide berth."
72,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_KRILE_000_027","Poor Erenville... He's still coming to terms with it."
73,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_028","You can hardly blame him. Let's leave him be for now."
74,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_029","Come on, let's get moving ourselves."
75,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_KRILE_000_055","Right would seem to be the more direct path to the terminal, but I must say I'm curious about that building on the left."
76,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_GRAHATIA_000_060","The mechanical soldiers are as common here as they are in Solution Nine. I wonder how long ago they were created."
77,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_070","Looks like we have two paths to choose from. I thought I saw Cahciua heading left, though."
78,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_KRILE_000_071","While that would seem to be a detour, I must say I'm rather curious about that round building."
79,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_072","Well, I'm always up for the scenic route. Let's follow after Cahciua and see what the building's about!"
80,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_KRILE_000_075","Found her!"
81,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_GRAHATIA_000_080","A round building with seating for spectators... Might this be a fighting arena?"
82,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_085","Erenville is...elsewhere, of course."
83,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_090","Well now, look who came this way too. Great minds, as they say!"
84,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_GRAHATIA_000_091","This appears to be a fighting arena. Is it also a recreation of an actual place?"
85,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_092","In all likelihood. While I don't know the details, I understand such facilities were once common across the land."
86,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_093","Though it's closed at the moment, even Solution Nine has the Arcadion. It may well be a legacy of the past."
87,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_CAHCIUA_000_094","Anyway, it seems the next match is about to begin. As I've already spectated my fill, I will move on, but you ought to head inside for a look!"
88,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_GRAHATIA_000_095","To think that Krile would actually meet her parents..."
89,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_WUKLAMAT_000_100","Miracles really do happen here... I'm happy for Krile."
90,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_KRILE_000_110","Could it be that the system orchestrated this reunion as well...?"
91,"TEXT_KINGMF108_04953_KRILE_000_111","Forgive me... This is all so much to take in, I'm struggling to collect my thoughts."
