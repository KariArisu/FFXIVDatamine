2,"TEXT_KINGME109_04940_SEQ_02","After a rummage through the ruins, you manage to gather a decent amount of electrope pieces. As per Otis's instructions, you bear them to Gulool Ja for identification."

4,"TEXT_KINGME109_04940_SEQ_04","With the preparations complete, Otis cooks up the promised repast and serves it up for all to enjoy. As you relax afterwards, your bellies full of delicious stew, Wuk Lamat has a candid conversation with Gulool Ja and tells him what it means to be family. At Alisaie's urging, Otis then shares with you his tale. Centuries ago, before lightning had changed the world, he was an ordinary man who served as a knight of Alexandria. When the great calamity struck, the king and queen passed away, and their only daughter the princess was taken by illness not long after ascending the throne. Through the power of electrope, however, her soul and memories were preserved, and she was spared eternal death. This procedure was made possible by none other than Otis, who volunteered as a test subject, resulting in his transformation into the machine he is now. Those that are thus recreated from the memories of the departed are known as the Endless, and to everyone's shock, it is revealed that Sphene was the first of them─the queen who was brought back to life."
5,"TEXT_KINGME109_04940_SEQ_05","As you and your companions struggle to process the revelation of Sphene's true nature, questions arise over whether Cahciua and her people had been aware of this fact. For all that you have learned, it seems there is still much and more that you do not know..."
