1,"TEXT_KINGLA201_04975_SEQ_01","Pameka, the scrivener of Wachumeqimeqi, earns her living by transcribing letters and official documents for patrons─but her most recent commission would have her record an entire book. You agree to be the talented artisan who will bind said tome, and set off for Xbalyav Ty'e to meet with your client."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA201_04975_SEQ_02","An order for one tome turns to several as you speak with Zemoweni, a Tonawawta newcomer to Tuliyollal and employee of Xbalyav Ty'e. He has gained a fascination with the stories told by the restaurant's regulars, and wishes to immortalize them in text. Pameka explains she plans to transcribe the stories he dictates, and you return to her workshop in preparation for the project to come."
3,"TEXT_KINGLA201_04975_SEQ_03","Despite her piles of parchment and surplus of ink, Pameka has a few more preparations to make before Zemoweni's first dictation. When next you return, your joint endeavor will begin in earnest, so ready your tools for the tales of a lifetime..."

58,"TEXT_KINGLA201_04975_PAMEKA_100_007","Then you should have little trouble here. Turali borrows the Eorzean alphabet, and you will find our languages share numerous similarities."
59,"TEXT_KINGLA201_04975_PAMEKA_000_008","We of Tuliyollal speak Turali with aplomb, yet it is a comparatively young language. As our traditional tongues place emphasis on oral storytelling over the written word, we have a sizable population of citizens who do not read or write."

83,"TEXT_KINGLA201_04975_ZEMOWENI_000_108","But memory has its limits, and I'm afraid the details from so many different narratives might eventually become jumbled or forgotten. Which is why I thought to record them in a book for all to enjoy."
84,"TEXT_KINGLA201_04975_ZEMOWENI_000_109","Of course, my people pass down our traditions via the spoken word, so I neither read nor write. Pameka may be an exception among Tonawawta in that respect."
