70,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_XBALAALOLD04901_000_052","I only saw him in passing, mind─if anyone were to know more, I'd wager it would be Hunmu Rruk. He was already Xbr'aax Rax then."

81,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_KRILE_000_080","Not by blood, but he is family nonetheless."

88,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_KRILE_000_086","Out of more <Emphasis>general</Emphasis> curiosity, I have another question. They say the Yok Huy once dwelled in these forests. Where was that, exactly?"
89,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_HUNMURRUK_000_087","<Emphasis>General</Emphasis> curiosity, indeed... But yes. Before they withdrew to Urqopacha some five centuries ago, the Yok Huy claimed Yak T'el as their own."
90,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_HUNMURRUK_000_088","Many of their architectural remains can be found in the lower forests─the Ja Tiika Heartland."

92,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_KRILE_000_090","Thank you. That answers much and more."
93,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_HUNMURRUK_000_091","I understand what it means to long for one's family. So believe me when I say that, though my position forbids me from aiding you further, I wish you nothing but success."

109,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_HUNMURRUK_000_126","Girls are rarely born amongst the Xbr'aal. So when she arrived, the village was elated. Such joy I felt when first I held her...and pain when I found her at the bottom of a cenote."

115,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_HUNMURRUK_000_132","I was determined not to let them succeed. And so I let the memory of my daughter die in that cenote, and gave her into the care of the one person I knew who could protect her."
116,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_HUNMURRUK_100_132","...Dawnservant Gulool Ja Ja."
117,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_HUNMURRUK_000_133","Though she was born to lead the Xbr'aal, fate had a greater plan for Wuk Lamat."

119,"TEXT_KINGMC105_04901_HUNMURRUK_000_135","If the villain who attempted to murder my daughter was indeed of Mamook, then rancor towards the Xbr'aal still burns. "
