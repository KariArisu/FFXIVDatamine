1,"TEXT_KINGMD109_04920_SEQ_01","The sun has set on the former Dawnservant Gulool Ja Ja. Unfortunately, there is no time to remain idle─the people of Tuliyollal have need of their new leaders.

※In the event that you leave the area and wish to return, speak with the Landsguard gatekeeper at the entrance to Sunperch."
2,"TEXT_KINGMD109_04920_SEQ_02","Wuk Lamat wishes to render aid to the people of Tuliyollal, and the Scions readily offer their assistance. She assigns them all to various places about the city in the hopes of attending to as many wounded as possible. As for you, she asks that you accompany her to the Resplendent Quarter."
3,"TEXT_KINGMD109_04920_SEQ_03","You have aided what people you can in the Resplendent Quarter, but there is yet more work to be done. Perhaps Wuk Lamat has an idea of where else your help may be needed."
4,"TEXT_KINGMD109_04920_SEQ_04","Not wishing to waste any time, Wuk Lamat asks that you make for Talonmarch. Your task is to assess what damage has been done to the area, after which you can reconvene with Alisaie at Bayside Bevy."
5,"TEXT_KINGMD109_04920_SEQ_05","You have a look about Talonmarch, and while there are parts that remain unscathed, the same cannot be said for what has become of Bayside Bevy. With your assessment complete, you seek out Alisaie."
6,"TEXT_KINGMD109_04920_SEQ_06","Alisaie has done what she can for the people of Bayside Bevy, and based on what little damage has been done to the buildings, she is convinced Zoraal Ja's attack was a display of force and not intended to inflict significant harm. Putting his motives aside, she is more concerned for Wuk Lamat, and asks that you return to check on her. Word has it she was last seen near the Gornitruq Gleamsands."
7,"TEXT_KINGMD109_04920_SEQ_07","You find Wuk Lamat alone, overcome with shock. You offer her what words of comfort you can, and though her heart yet aches, she finds the determination to press on."
8,"TEXT_KINGMD109_04920_SEQ_08","Wuk Lamat has newfound resolve to strike down Zoraal Ja and secure the peace and safety of Tural. She prepares to return to the place and speak with Koana to plan their next move, bidding you and the Scions join them."
9,"TEXT_KINGMD109_04920_SEQ_09","Alisaie is relieved to hear Wuk Lamat is doing better. There can be no doubt the Scions will do all in their power to assist the new Dawnservants, but she cannot shake the uneasy feeling brought on by this unprecedented threat."
