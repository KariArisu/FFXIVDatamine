50,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_011","Namely, I'm looking for maca, a plant which imparts unflagging vigor, and springstone, which is used to warm the body and soothe aches in the muscles. "
51,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_012","You can bring me whichever is easier for you to gather─either will sell just as quickly. Since this is only a trial, let's start with say...six or so?"
52,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_UVLO_000_013","Six springstones from Urqopacha... Understood. I shall return with haste."

61,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_050","I must say, there's no greater reassurance than knowing I have wares to sell. Even though this was but a trial run, you conducted yourself flawlessly."
62,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_051","Truth be told, when I first began this endeavor, I didn't imagine I would sell such a wide array of goods. But health is a goal we all share, and there are any number of ways to pursue it."
63,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_052","Take maca, for instance. It thrives in the harsh climes of Urqopacha, accumulating nutrients from its unique environment. It has been a favorite since time immemorial for its nutritional value and invigorating properties."
64,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_053","Springstone, on the other hand, is a type of volcanic rock. It retains heat rather well, so after a bit of polishing and warming, you can place it in your pocket or directly on the skin. Even in hotter regions, it's used to relieve stiff muscles and troublesome aches."
65,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_054","I know you came to me seeking gainful employment, but you must place your own health first and foremost. If anything ever ails you, I would welcome your custom with open arms."

67,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_056","Judging by his story, he arrived in Tural only shortly before visiting my shop. His confident stride suggested he knew where he was going, but how could he...?"
68,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_UVLO_000_057","I am returned. Master Shunye, I hope my deliveries meet with your satisfaction."
69,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_058","Well, I suppose there was no need to worry."
70,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_059","Hmmm... Yes, these are good. They'll certainly sell."
71,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_060","Forgive my imposition, but have you been to Tural before? Or did you hire someone to guide you?"
72,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_UVLO_000_061","Neither. This is my first time in Tural, and I have no money for a guide."
73,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_UVLO_000_062","Yet this city is home to a great many people. If you ask around for information, you can piece together any puzzle in time. That is, of course, if you have the patience to do so."

84,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SHUNYE_000_073","Well, I may prove to be a worthless teacher in that regard, but I suppose I can try. As for our mutual prosperity, that depends on us..."

86,"TEXT_KINGLA402_04990_SYSTEM_000_075","Shunye is pleased with your efforts. He now considers you a <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Greenhorn Gatherer<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>!"
