51,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_WUKLAMAT_000_020","I've been thinking... By wearing regulators, the people of Alexandria had been spared the fear of death."
52,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_WUKLAMAT_000_021","That's because the device not only resurrects you─it also erases your memories of the departed. The very notion of dying would have become vague, if not forgotten."
53,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_WUKLAMAT_000_022","To be killed over and over... I can't imagine how traumatized the survivors must be. Even if they're not physically hurt, they would still need care."

67,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_TREMBLINGRESIDENT4943_000_041","To be killed again, and again, and again... It was a living nightmare. And King Zoraal Ja was behind it, you say?"
68,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_TREMBLINGRESIDENT4943_000_042","Since he suddenly appeared, he's done nothing good for us. He thinks only of war─ordered more soldiers be produced. And now he unleashes them on us..."

74,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_EXHAUSTEDRESIDENT4943_000_053","I'd always wondered why the Alexandrians never questioned her true nature, but now I think I understand why."
75,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_EXHAUSTEDRESIDENT4943_000_054","She personally fought to protect us. That's enough for me to know she's a worthy ruler. It doesn't matter what she is."
76,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_EXHAUSTEDRESIDENT4943_000_055","To fight for her people is proof of her dedication to her people. Whatever she may be, she is our queen."

84,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_WUKLAMAT_000_094","Bright as he is, there's no use hiding it. He'd eventually find out, and it'd hurt him more."

86,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_CAHCIUA_000_100","To make your own child suffer so... I cannot comprehend the heartlessness."

93,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_CAHCIUA_000_117","There's a room in the back you can use. Could you take Gulool Ja there?"
94,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_WUKLAMAT_000_118","I will, thank you."
95,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_CAHCIUA_000_120","The things I would say to Zoraal Ja as a mother... But I'd better not get started."

97,"TEXT_KINGME112_04943_CAHCIUA_000_122","Until the others return, you ought to take what rest you can as well. It isn't over yet, after all."
