2,"TEXT_KINGMF112_04957_SEQ_02","You take yourself around the gardens and, through a combination of conversation and observation, make a number of interesting discoveries. Satisfied, you go to report them to Cahciua."
3,"TEXT_KINGMF112_04957_SEQ_03","After you delight Cahciua with your findings, Erenville mentions that he caught sight of an unfamiliar scalekin. His description of it, however, leads Cahciua to believe that it may instead be a beastkin, and it is decided that you will all seek it out for observation."
4,"TEXT_KINGMF112_04957_SEQ_04","You join mother and son for their discussion on wildlife classification, which leads to the revelation that not only did Cahciua meet Galuf during his time in Tural, but also that it was his tales of Sharlayan gleaners which led her to encourage Erenville to become one when he was older. Cahciua then expresses her desire to visit the Cleyra Museum of Nature, which she says has creatures that take patrons on leisure flights. As only three people can fly at a time, the group heading there is limited to Cahciua, Erenville, and yourself."
