1,"TEXT_KINGRA101_04960_SEQ_01","As you walk along the avenue, you cannot help but notice a stylishly dressed man who perks up upon sighting you. Introducing himself as Metem, he explains that he represents Ascension Arcadia, the premier enterprise for entertainment in the city, which boasts the Arcadion as its flagship facility. He states that he has been seeking its next star─you─to join the Ascension Arcadia Championship. If you are interested in learning more, he bids you proceed to the Arcadion's doors, where an attendant will escort you to the greenroom."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA101_04960_SEQ_02","Though you are not yet sure what to think of Metem, you are nevertheless enticed by the idea of joining this championship. So it is that you make your way to the Arcadion and beckon the attendant awaiting your arrival to show you inside.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA101_04960_SEQ_03","Metem informs you that each fighter in the Ascension Arcadia Championship employs the use of feral souls to augment their strength, and the three tiers of the competition are divided by the potency of the souls utilized: the light-heavyweight tier at the lowest level, followed by the cruiserweight tier, and finally the heavyweight tier at the highest level. Your goal is to climb the ranks by defeating the respective champions of each tier and ultimately become the grand champion. To ensure the matches are fair, Metem requires that the souls of seven fighters join you in battle. Should you be victorious in your matches, he promises to set them free."
4,"TEXT_KINGRA101_04960_SEQ_04","With the rules now thoroughly elucidated, and the objective of freeing the souls stored in the repository in mind, you decide to accept Metem's proposal. When you are ready to face your first opponent, you need only speak with him to begin."
