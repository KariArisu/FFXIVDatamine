48,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_ALISAIE_000_001","Well, having established that we should be wary, we could use more information."
49,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_ALISAIE_000_002","So let's head to this place, the outskirts, and see what we can learn. Perhaps about Sphene, as well."
50,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_010","I trust you have similar farming facilities in Tural?"
51,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_WUKLAMAT_000_011","They're completely different from ours. I've got no idea what all those machines do."
52,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_012","We settled on this approach after some trial and error. The Turali have their own methods of farming, which they wanted to continue employing."
53,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_013","But the environment makes it challenging. There's too much rain and not enough light."
54,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_100_013","Thankfully, the use of electrope has allowed us to fortify the buildings here, as well as provide what nature cannot."
55,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_WUKLAMAT_000_014","Electro-what...?"
56,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_015","Electrope. It's a material we use for myriad devices and applications."
57,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_016","A topic for another time, perhaps. If you would follow me, we're nearly to the outskirts."
58,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_KRILE_000_020","A most unusual farm, but the produce appears normal enough."
59,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_WUKLAMAT_000_025","Have you ever seen such strange contraptions? I wonder what this one is used for."
60,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_ALISAIE_000_030","It's a relief to see the people here are well, at least."
61,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_GRAHATIA_000_035","The innovations of Alexandria are nothing short of extraordinary."
62,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_ERENVILLE_000_040","Those brick buildings... I've seen their like before, though I cannot remember where."
63,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_KRILE_000_050","It's a rather lively settlement, isn't it? In defiance of this ceaseless gloom, almost."
64,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_WUKLAMAT_000_055","It's a relief to see the people here are well. Hopefully the same can be said for everyone in Yyasulani."
65,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_ALISAIE_000_060","I'll admit, I've seen nothing particularly suspicious. Yet."
66,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_GRAHATIA_000_065","It's fascinating how they've combined traditional bricklaying with electrope-based engineering. A curious blending of two cultures."
67,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_ERENVILLE_000_070","This is a Tonawawtan village. Or at least, it was. Before the dome and these strange contraptions."
68,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_080","Electrope has done much to improve the efficiency of their farming, but hasn't replaced everything."
69,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_081","The people wanted to preserve their old way of life, and we did not want to force ours upon them."
70,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_WUKLAMAT_000_082","You went to such lengths so that our cultures could coexist. Even going so far as to learn our tongue... I'm sure everyone appreciated that."
71,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_083","Communication was thankfully not an issue, for the Turali tongue is surprisingly similar to Alexandrian."
72,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_084","Of course, there are words and phrases for which there is no equivalent, but those can be taught with minimal effort."
73,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_085","Through mutual respect, understanding, and patience, we Alexandrians and Turali have learned a great deal from one another."
74,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_SPHENE_000_086","And I am sure there is much you wish to learn as well. So please, if you have questions, do not hesitate to ask."
75,"TEXT_KINGMD117_04928_WUKLAMAT_000_090","Touring farmlands with the queen of another nation is not how I expected to spend my day."
