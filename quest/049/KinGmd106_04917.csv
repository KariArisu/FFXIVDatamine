54,"TEXT_KINGMD106_04917_ERENVILLE_000_023","They were understandably worried, but I've told them of what happened in Hhusatahwi. Our minor adventure made for quite the tale."

70,"TEXT_KINGMD106_04917_ZEKOWA_000_044","We'll train night and day, so no one'll get the better of us ever again. Isn't that right?"
71,"TEXT_KINGMD106_04917_KWIKANA_000_045","Right! And you'll teach us how you draw your pistols so fast, won't you?"

86,"TEXT_KINGMD106_04917_IYAATE_000_060","I'd like to believe the train will be up and running again soon..."
87,"TEXT_KINGMD106_04917_SHENZA_000_063","I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do with the tracks as they are."

89,"TEXT_KINGMD106_04917_SHENZA_000_070","We'll be ready to handle that timber when you and the chief get back."
90,"TEXT_KINGMD106_04917_ZAWPYA_000_075","With your help, we'll get the railroad operating again. And then you'll have the chance to see our engine in motion─it's poetry, I tell you!"
91,"TEXT_KINGMD106_04917_NITOWIKWE_000_080","Right, we've got work to be getting on with ourselves!"
92,"TEXT_KINGMD106_04917_ERENVILLE_000_090","Though no small number live in Shaaloani, I must confess that I've never visited the home of the Hhetsarro."
