1,"TEXT_KINGLA107_04974_SEQ_01","You speak with Rral Soj, who informs you that she's heard word from the palace seer about the request concerning the royal family. It seems you will need to journey to the Arterial Climb near Vollok Shoonsa to learn more."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA107_04974_SEQ_02","At long last the palace seer elaborates on the details of the request, explaining that Vows Wuk Lamat and Koana are in need of ceremonial sun reflectors─traditional devices used for certain rites. With a set of the design plans used to craft the late Gulool Ja Ja's sun reflector in hand, Rral Soj asks that you return to the shop to discuss how to go about crafting this complex item."
3,"TEXT_KINGLA107_04974_SEQ_03","Papawni has tasked you with crafting a solar reflector, which you must then deliver to Rral Soj.

※In the event you lose the components or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Papawni."
4,"TEXT_KINGLA107_04974_SEQ_04","You deliver the sun reflector to Rral Soj. After waiting a brief while, Papawni finishes up the remaining device, using yours as an example. The three of you set off for the palace to present the finished products to the palace seer, who awaits you in the courtyard of Vollok Shoonsa. While impressed by the design, the seer is most keen to ascertain the functionality of the reflectors, and puts them to the test immediately. Fortunately, the trial proves successful, with the seer not only extolling your exemplary work, but even offering XRral Soj Metalwares an official royal warrant of appointment. Rral Soj does not hesitate to accept, declaring it an honor. It seems that her lifelong dream of crafting metalwares fit for the royal family has been realized."
5,"TEXT_KINGLA107_04974_SEQ_05","Rral Soj and Papawni are ecstatic about the reception the solar reflectors received at the palace, and finally have the confidence to spread their wings and attempt to fly on their own. With the combination of Rral Soj's unmatched output, and Papawni's unparalleled fastidiousness, you feel confident that the future of XRral Soj Metalwares is bright."
