0,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SEQ_00","Shunye appears concerned for one of his most diligent employees."
1,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SEQ_01","After a bit of prodding from Uvlo, Shunye agrees to task you both with going to Yak T'el, where a meteor once struck the earth. There you are to dig deep into the ground in search of anything which might resemble the Azure Tears.

※Deep earth fragments can be gathered near Iq Br'aax by miners, and near the village of Ilyon Asoh by botanists.

※Minimum collectability rating for this delivery is 240. Delivering items with a rating of 600 or more will earn greater rewards."
2,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SEQ_02","After examining the mineral deposits you deliver, Shunye admits that while there are traces of a deep blue substance, it is still not enough to form a definite conclusion. Although a somewhat disappointing conclusion, you and Uvlo lift Shunye's spirits by reaffirming your dedication to solving the mystery behind his village's fate. The apothecary agrees to move forward, but asks that you wait until he thinks of a better approach than to dig up the entirety of Yak T'el. In the meantime, hone your gathering skills for what is sure to be a challenging search."

50,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_011","Although since last we met, Uvlo has been acting strangely."
51,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_012","He brushes off all my attempts to help and works with a singular focus. I think he still believes he crossed a line in asking about my past, and is focusing his efforts more than usual to make up for his perceived affront."
52,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_013","All of which is to say, I've no work for you today."
53,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_014","Well, if our tasks for the day are done, I think we should try to unravel the nature of these “Azure Tears” you found."
54,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_015","...Ah hah, I understand now. You squared away today's work so quickly because you had hoped to employ <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s energies on the tears. "
55,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_016","Not exactly. Yet I admit the thought did occur to me."

58,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_019","Truth be told, I can scarce imagine how we might prove they are connected to a meteor. As difficult as it is for me to admit, Master Shunye, your theory remains just that."
59,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_020","Yet if we were to find similar crystals at another location where meteors had fallen, what then?"

62,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_023","I've asked all who would listen if they've seen anything resembling the tears. But even the most worldly of my connections say they are quite singular."
63,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_024","Perhaps they are the only objects of their kind in this world. In that case, they would be rarer than any precious jewel. "
64,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_025","I believe your inability to find any information on them gives us all the more reason to look."

71,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_032","<sigh> Very well, but I'll only make this imposition on you once. You've done enough for me already."
72,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_033","Now, there are several locations in Tural where meteorites have fallen in the past."
73,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_034","The Cexudross crater is purported to be the largest by scholars who study such phenomena."
74,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_035","However, over the years nature has healed the scar left behind. Soil has accumulated, and trees have taken root. Now the area is known as Yak T'el."
75,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_036","But I doubt a little earth and wood can deter you. Somewhere under all that wildlife, you may find material that has lain there since the meteors struck."
76,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_037","If you find something that resembles the tears, then we may be able to solidify a theory of what transpired fifty years ago. We'll know they came from a meteorite, at least."
77,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_038","Well then, let us waste no time. Off to Yak T'el we go."
78,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_040","I'm sorry that you got roped into this, but I'm looking forward to seeing what you can find all the same. What we seek is most likely in Yak T'el─you'll have to dig deep, but I know you're equal to the task."
79,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_050","You actually did it! I wager the earth you found these in hadn't been touched by hands for uncountable years, if at all."

82,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_053","You've done well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. With both your and Uvlo's samples, we may be able to reach a conclusion at last."
83,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_060","Did you discover aught?"

85,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_062","And when I shined a light on it, its color did indeed resemble the tears."
86,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_063","But even so, there wasn't enough. As far as my abilities can discern, there's no way to say for certain that the two substances are one and the same."
87,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_064","I see..."
88,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_065","Yet you admit a possibility that they might be related. These are good tidings."
89,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_066","We simply need to keep digging, and eventually we will find a sample large enough to give us a definite conclusion."
90,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_067","I did not expect this journey to be finished after just one outing. I shall return to Yak T'el as many times as it takes."
91,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_068","Why must you do this to yourself, Uvlo?"
92,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_069","You needn't feel obligated to help me resolve this personal matter. At the end of the day, it won't teach you any more about the Shetona..."
93,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_070","...You are correct. I admit that digging deep into the soil is not a task that will help my people thrive."
94,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_071","Yet hearing Uapyota speak with such affection about her family, and seeing you suffer so deeply from the loss of your own, I came to a realization."

98,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_075","That is why you still have the tears, even though they hold naught but painful memories. Before, you said that your long years running this shop allowed you to guess that the stones were related to your tragedy."
99,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_UVLO_000_076","But I know that deep down, you started this apothecary because you <Emphasis>knew</Emphasis> it would bring you closer to an answer."

104,"TEXT_KINGLA406_04994_SHUNYE_000_081","When I do, I only ask that you be there to help, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Can I count on you?"
