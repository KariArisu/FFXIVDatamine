92,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_ERENVILLE_000_140","...I somehow anticipated this."
93,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_CAHCIUA_000_150","This particular garden is called Blooms of Discovery. Beautiful, isn't it?"
94,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_GRAHATIA_000_151","It's absolutely stunning! And they are all actual plants?"
95,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_CAHCIUA_000_152","They are indeed. These specimens were brought here hundreds of years ago for conservation, as the calamity had pushed them to the brink of extinction."
96,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_KRILE_000_153","So this zone is like a great conservatory."
97,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_CAHCIUA_000_154","Precisely, my dear Krile! Here you'll find flora and fauna the likes of which no longer exist elsewhere."
98,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_CAHCIUA_000_155","Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter?"
99,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_ERENVILLE_000_156","I suppose."
100,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_ERENVILLE_000_157","I expect that some creatures I encountered outside of Tural may have cousins in this world."
101,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_ERENVILLE_000_158","While I am no expert on life in the reflections, it would make for an interesting study to compare them."
102,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_CAHCIUA_000_159","Now there's an idea! Leave it to my pupil to think up such."
103,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_CAHCIUA_000_160","Here we have not only a worlds-traversing adventurer and a veteran gleaner, but a pair of Sharlayan's finest scholars besides."
104,"TEXT_KINGMF111_04956_CAHCIUA_000_161","It's a veritable gathering of inquisitiveness, and I'm thrilled to be part of it!"
