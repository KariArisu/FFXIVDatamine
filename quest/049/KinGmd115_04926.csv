2,"TEXT_KINGMD115_04926_SEQ_02","With the Dawnblazer complete, you and your comrades hop aboard and set out for the dome. The train's fortifications and weaponry are soon put to the test when soldiers on flying vehicles descend upon you. Despite their best efforts, however, they fail to stop the train. Shortly before reaching its final destination, you all jump off and watch as the Dawnblazer crashes into Zoraal Ja's base."
