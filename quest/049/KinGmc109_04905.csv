49,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_KRILE_000_005","“The price we pay”... Is she referring to the marriages between the Hoobigo and Boonewa clans?"
50,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ERENVILLE_000_010","What I know about Mamool Ja extremism is limited to what I've heard through rumors. The same is true for most who hail from Xak Tural."
51,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ALPHINAUD_000_015","Gulool Ja Ja labored to break down walls. That his very existence would instead lead some to raise them is unfortunate..."
52,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ALISAIE_000_020","I expect it was for his devotees that Bakool Ja Ja joined the rite of succession."
53,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_MIILALJA_000_025","There is a place that will help you to understand our plight."
54,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_MIILALJA_000_026","It lies far to the west of here. Follow me."
55,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ERENVILLE_000_030","You won't find sights like these anywhere else."
56,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_035","Is that a meteorite up there?"
57,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ERENVILLE_000_036","Aye. And judging by their attachment, that tree must benefit from the meteorite's unique aether."
58,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ERENVILLE_000_037","Anyway, we should press on. Miilal Ja was anxious for us to see whatever it is she has to show us."
59,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_KRILE_000_040","The canopy blocks out the sun so completely, it's as if we're in a room without windows..."

61,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_KRILE_000_046","I'd love to talk to Mamool Ja hunters and learn about their ways, except they'd probably ignore me..."
62,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_KRILE_000_047","The others have continued on. Let's catch up to them."
63,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_MIILALJA_000_050","The place I would show you is just ahead."
64,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_KRILE_000_055","A cavern. And it looks deep..."
65,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ERENVILLE_000_060","I was not aware that such tunnels could be found in the Ja Tiika Heartland. A well-kept secret indeed..."
66,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ALPHINAUD_000_065","Having seen how dark this forest is, I can understand why so many Mamool Ja chose to live in Tuliyollal instead."
67,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ALISAIE_000_070","What are we looking at, then?"
68,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_075","This is the place you wanted to show us?"
69,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_MIILALJA_100_076","It lies just beyond this passage."
70,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_MIILALJA_000_076","Entry to these grounds is not permitted even to the devout."
71,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_MIILALJA_000_077","Nonetheless, I would reveal our secrets to you. Rest assured I shall take full responsibility."
72,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_MIILALJA_000_078","Come. See for yourself the truth of the blessed."
73,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_080","Hey, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>... Before we rejoin the others, can we talk for a moment?"
74,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_081","I really hated him, you know. Bakool Ja Ja. With every fiber of my being."
75,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_082","He tried to ruin Ihih'hana, sabotaged us on the river, kidnapped me for my keystone, and released the most vicious tural vidraal of all time! Anything he could do to cause us pain, he did!"
76,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_083","Never in a million years would I forgive him..."
77,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_084","But the moment I understood why he did what he did─the pain he's been carrying this whole time─all my anger just...evaporated."
78,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
79,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_A1_000_001","Does his pain justify his actions in your eyes?"
80,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_A1_000_002","He still needs to make amends."
81,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_086","I hear you. Bakool Ja Ja's motives don't absolve him of his crimes. He must answer for them, like anyone else."
82,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_100_086","But right now, my duty is to ensure that no one in Mamook feels desperate enough to go to such lengths ever again."
83,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_088","Anyway, thanks for listening. Now that I've voiced that, I feel readier for the challenges ahead. Come on, let's head back to the city!"
84,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_KRILE_000_090","It's amazing how Wuk Lamat can connect with anyone. She has an incredible gift."
85,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ERENVILLE_000_095","To think that there was such a dark secret behind blessed siblings... Even among the Mamool Ja, I cannot imagine many know the whole truth─especially not those who reside in the capital."
86,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ALPHINAUD_000_100","I had no idea Bakool Ja Ja was bearing such a burden. Had he but chosen a different path..."
87,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ALPHINAUD_100_100","Still, I believe our true character is demonstrated not by right action, but rather by our conduct upon recognizing our faults. It is a struggle I know all too well..."
88,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_ALISAIE_000_105","...Sometimes it's best to just forgive and move on. It can be difficult─gods, don't I know it─but that's all the more reason to try your damndest to look past how you were wronged and let bygones be bygones."
89,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_110","Bakool Ja Ja's scale represents his faith in us."
90,"TEXT_KINGMC109_04905_WUKLAMAT_000_111","We won't fail him or his people."
