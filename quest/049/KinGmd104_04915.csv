72,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_031","<sigh> The bracelet must wait. Let's break him out and withdraw for now."
73,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_040","All that effort, and naught to show for it..."
74,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_041","Sorry about that... But damn, I didn't think anyone would have the balls to take on the Vulture!"
75,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_042","No need to apologize. We were planning to save you. Eventually."
76,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_043","Really? And I don't even know who you are. You secret admirers of mine or something?"
77,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_044","Hehe, I'm just havin' fun with you. But I do appreciate the help."
78,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_100_044","This man they call the Vulture. I've seen his face before."
79,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_110_044","Was he not the officer you confronted in town?"
80,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_120_044","The one and the same. When he's not masquerading as a gang leader, he serves as deputy chief of the Dustwatch. "
81,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_130_044","That would explain why the bandits are so confident they can avoid capture."
82,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_045","You're trying to get back something the Vulture stole, right? Let me help. It's the least I can do after you bailed me out back there. "
83,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_046","I have an idea where he's hid his cache. Reckon he's headed there now, too."
84,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_047","We can go together. I've got a score to settle with him myself."
85,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_048","I don't doubt that you do, but we need to know what it is first. Will you tell us?"
86,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_049","Right, so. Those bandits at Tonatenyawi? They're called the Daybreakers, and it was me and my friends that founded the group..."
87,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_050","B-But it wasn't a gang of cutthroats! Not back then..."
88,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_051","We just wanted to protect people who couldn't protect themselves. Kids being harassed by bullies, workers being exploited by the mining concerns─folks who needed help to even the odds."
89,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_052","That was three years ago. And whenever we found someone scheming in the shadows, we settled matters the best way we knew how."
90,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_053","With a duel!"
91,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_054","I see. By the old laws, anyone who loses in a duel must be held to account for their crimes, even those in positions of authority. "
92,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_055","And we made damn sure they did, every time. Before we knew it, our small band of friends commanded a force to be reckoned with."
93,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_056","Then, about a year ago, the Vulture and his thugs showed up. They got the better of us and took over the Daybreakers."
94,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_057","Everyone was afraid of him, so they did his bidding without question. But when he showed them how they could make a fortune, easily─<Emphasis>that</Emphasis> was when he really won them over."
95,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_058","Now the Daybreakers is nothing but a bunch of bandits and cutthroats who prey on the people it was created to protect."
96,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_059","I talked it over with my friends, Kwikana and Liwine, and we all agreed the only way to stop him was to challenge him to a duel."
97,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_060","And he accepted. I still remember how he gloated that he'd win..."
98,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_061","But when the day came, he showed up with the Dustwatch and had my friends arrested on charges of robbery."
99,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_062","As if that wasn't enough, he set their bail at a price no one could ever hope to pay."
100,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_063","With them locked away, there was no one left to help me. None of my old friends from the Daybreakers, and certainly not the Dustwatch..."
101,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_064","And that's why you were ready to challenge him in the middle of town."
102,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_065","I was, until that guy with the spear stopped me."
103,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_066","No sooner had I stepped out of town than the Vulture's minions caught me by surprise. They took me prisoner, then...well, you know the rest."
104,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_067","You said the Dustwatch would be of no help. Are they all working for the Vulture, then?"
105,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_068","No, not all of them."
106,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_069","The sheriff, Kemakka─he's as honest as they come, a staunch keeper of the peace. Problem is, he's a little too trusting and doesn't suspect a thing."
107,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_070","If it were my word against the deputy chief's, who do you think he'd believe?"
108,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_071","Well, if he knows where this Vulture keeps his spoils, perhaps he can help us recover Namikka's bracelet. What do you think?"
109,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_072","For what it's worth, I have a plan. But I can't do it alone."
110,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_073","A plan?"
111,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_074","All I ask is that you hear me out─but not here. I'll be waiting for you at Sheshenewezi Springs. "
112,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_075","I guess we can decide what to do after he gives us the pitch."
113,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_080","Thanks, I owe you one. For a moment there I thought you might actually leave me behind."
114,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_090","Good, you're here."
115,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ZEKOWA_000_091","This is where he hides his loot. I expect he'll show up soon."
116,"TEXT_KINGMD104_04915_ERENVILLE_000_095","I'm grateful he could take us to the deputy chief, but it will all be for naught if we're seen."
