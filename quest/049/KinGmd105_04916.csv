1,"TEXT_KINGMD105_04916_SEQ_01","Unbeknownst to the people of Sheshenewezi Springs, ceruleum barrels there are being packed with stolen goods to be shipped away and sold elsewhere. Wihuwte, the deputy chief of the Dustwatch, is both the leader of the bandits and the mastermind behind this scheme. To bring him to justice, Zekowa proposes that two of you lure Wihuwte away to Hhusatahwi while the third remains to find these barrels. Erenville volunteers to stay and search, leaving you and Zekowa to keep Wihuwte occupied."
2,"TEXT_KINGMD105_04916_SEQ_02","You approach Wihuwte, but he appears to be lost in thought. As he seems utterly determined to ignore you, perhaps a gentle /poke will get his attention."
3,"TEXT_KINGMD105_04916_SEQ_03","Having gotten Wihuwte to acknowledge your existence, you proceed to tell him that Zekowa attempted to rob you, but that you managed to subdue and capture him. While he appears slightly skeptical, he is nevertheless eager to follow you so he can tie up this loose end.

※You must be accompanied by Wihuwte to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_KINGMD105_04916_SEQ_04","You lead Wihuwte a ways into the desert. After coming to a stop, Wihuwte looks to you expectantly, but you claim to have misremembered where you left Zekowa. Not one to be deterred, the deputy chief bids you continue.

※You must be accompanied by Wihuwte to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
5,"TEXT_KINGMD105_04916_SEQ_05","You stop at another clearing, and again offer an excuse for why Zekowa is nowhere to be found. Wihuwte is clearly annoyed, but he asks you to keep going.

※You must be accompanied by Wihuwte to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
6,"TEXT_KINGMD105_04916_SEQ_06","Wihuwte's patience is wearing thin by the time you pause yet again to get your bearings. He warns you that if Zekowa is not at your next destination, he may be forced to do something you both regret.

※You must be accompanied by Wihuwte to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
7,"TEXT_KINGMD105_04916_SEQ_07","Wihuwte is seething, but before he can make good on his earlier threat, he is distracted by yelling nearby. He follows the voice a short distance to find a grinning Zekowa, who leads the deputy chief on a merry chase that ends back in Hhusatahwi. He prepares to arrest Zekowa, but in that moment Erenville arrives with a barrel full of the townsfolk's stolen possessions, and subsequently reveals the existence of the bandit's operation to a growing crowd. Accusing the deputy chief of being behind this criminal enterprise, Zekowa challenges Wihuwte to a duel, who is forced to accept. The ensuing altercation is over in the blink of an eye, and Wihuwte falls to the ground defeated."
8,"TEXT_KINGMD105_04916_SEQ_08","Wihuwte has been arrested, and Zekowa's friends are freed from jail. Thanks to you and Erenville, it would seem everything in Sheshenewezi Springs has at last been put to rights."
