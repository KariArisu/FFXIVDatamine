53,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CAHCIUA_000_006","And remember, we Endless are but facsimiles crafted from memories. You needn't feel guilt for erasing us."

55,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_WUKLAMAT_000_008","It is. Nonetheless, it's our duty as the living to know and remember them."
56,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_WUKLAMAT_000_009","So let's pull ourselves together and keep at it. Keep seeking them out."
57,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CAHCIUA_000_010","I'd appreciate that. Come, let's head to the next zone."
58,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CAHCIUA_000_011","Yesterland, it's called, and another zip line at the Gate of Remembrance will take you there."

60,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CAHCIUA_000_013","While shutting down a terminal should erase the Endless bound to it, those with strong, unresolved feelings may linger for a time."
61,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CAHCIUA_000_014","If you encounter such individuals, perhaps you could lend them an ear. For their hopes are proof that they once lived."
62,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_KRILE_000_015","Yesterland has an altogether different look. Each zone has a distinct character, 'twould seem."
63,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_GRAHATIA_000_016","That lively place yonder appears to be Yesterland. I wonder what manner of folk we will find there."

68,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_WUKLAMAT_000_020","Amazing... Is this also a recreation of an actual place?"
69,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CAHCIUA_000_021","After a fashion. Yesterland is themed upon a period of peace, before the Storm Surge had engulfed the world in conflict."
70,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CAHCIUA_000_022","It was a golden age for Alexandria, and they've captured it here in the form of an amusement park."
71,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_GRAHATIA_000_023","Well now, another large-scale attraction!"
72,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_Q1_001_023","What will you say?"
73,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_A1_002_023","Tell me I'm not the only one who's excited!"
74,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_A1_003_023","It's exhausting just being here..."
75,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_A1_004_023","It feels like the Gold Saucer."
76,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_A1_005_023","I'm put in mind of Lyhe Mheg."
77,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_GRAHATIA_010_023","Haha, I'm not ashamed to admit I'm excited as well, and I imagine this is how we're intended to feel."
78,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_GRAHATIA_020_023","So it goes with such places. But at the very least, it doesn't appear overly crowded."
79,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_GRAHATIA_030_023","It does, doesn't it? It's exciting to simply step through the entrance, and I imagine this is how we're intended to feel."
80,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_GRAHATIA_040_023","You mean you've visited the pixies' Garden of Dreams!? Thank goodness you are still with us..."
81,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_GRAHATIA_050_023","'Tis all too easy to lose oneself in such a wondrous place. By the time you think to leave, dozens of years may have already passed."
82,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_GRAHATIA_000_024","And perhaps the very same could be said of this place..."
83,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CAHCIUA_000_025","On the far side of Yesterland is a castle. That's where the terminal is located, in the basement."
84,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CAHCIUA_000_026","I'll go on ahead and wait for you there. Take what time you need to get acquainted with the locals."

86,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_WUKLAMAT_000_028","Like before, we'll speak with the Endless. We'll learn what's dear to them before doing what we must."
87,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_WUKLAMAT_000_029","Right, let's start by exploring and get our bearings!"
88,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_SYSTEM_000_060","The beautiful artwork on the ground depicts a swirl of stars. Perhaps such a sight was once visible in the Alexandrian night sky."
89,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_SYSTEM_000_061","Appearing to be a domicile, this building resembles those that lie submerged in Heritage Found. The windows are composed of a colorful array of stained glass."
90,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CHILDENDLESS04951_000_062","Oh, hello there, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>mister</If>! We're just talking about Ser Otis. Do you know him?"
91,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CHILDENDLESS04951_000_063","He's a bit odd and doesn't get jokes, but he's really strong and can vanquish fiends in a flash!"
92,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CHILDENDLESS04951_000_064","He's probably out there fighting right now. When I grow up, I want to be strong like him!"
93,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_CHILDENDLESS04951_000_065","When I grow up, I want to be strong like Ser Otis! I'm going to protect Queen Sphene!"
94,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_SYSTEM_000_070","The “Ser Otis” the children spoke of calls to mind another Otis. It might be worth seeking the man out to confirm his identity."
95,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_SYSTEM_000_080","A man is engaged in battle with fiends. He may need a helping hand."
96,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_OTIS_000_085","'Tis plain you are no stranger to battle. If you would kindly tend to this fiend, I shall protect the children!"
97,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_WUKLAMAT_000_110","Gods, what a surprise to meet Otis."
98,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_WUKLAMAT_000_111","He might not be the exact same as the one we met in Heritage Found, but still..."
99,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_WUKLAMAT_000_112","Thinking back, he mentioned that he was a test subject for soul preservation. That might explain why he's here in this way."
100,"TEXT_KINGMF106_04951_WUKLAMAT_000_113","In any case, I'd love to talk to him some more. There are some things I need to tell him."
