1,"TEXT_KINGMC113_04909_SEQ_01","Ketenramm has invited you and your comrades to his home, which is situated nearby. You cannot help but consider the subtle shade of his irises on your way to the Blue-eyes' Abode..."
2,"TEXT_KINGMC113_04909_SEQ_02","In speaking with her father's old friend, Wuk Lamat discovers some parallels between Ketenramm's bond with Gulool Ja Ja and her own with the Scions. Comrades are precious indeed─especially when they can deduce the location of the golden prize one seeks. Krile shares her growing suspicion that the legendary city may be located in the forests of Yak T'el, and thus the group resolves to ask the now cordial citizens for information while replenishing their traveling supplies."
3,"TEXT_KINGMC113_04909_SEQ_03","According to Erenville, Ketenramm and his mentor are acquaintances, but the gleaner is as reserved as ever when it comes to sharing details about his personal life. He excuses himself to go and meet the others by the aetheryte."

Luckily, Miilal Ja would repay your kindness to her community by divulging all she knows about the golden city while Zereel Ja pointedly turns a blind eye. All parts of the Ja Tiika Heartland have been thoroughly charted except for the Skydeep Cenote, the final resting place of countless young lives lost. Comparing Miilal Ja's testimony with those of Hunmu Rruk and Vorporlor, it seems all but certain that you have at last discovered the city's location. With Bakool Ja Ja's blessed scale in hand, you set forth to Gok Draak Descent..."
5,"TEXT_KINGMC113_04909_SEQ_05","The doors of the cenotaph loom above you and the air is thick with the smell of earth, water, and age. Your group offers prayers to the souls of the departed before doing what you must to see the rite of succession to its end.

When Wuk Lamat places her completed tablets upon the provided pedestal, the door opens, revealing an extraordinary room. Black stone and glowing lights seem almost Allagan at first, but their differences quickly outnumber the similarities.

A gate stands dormant at the far end of the room─but before anyone can comment on it, the Dawnservant's booming laugh announces his arrival. Further discussion of this latest mystery is set aside for the time being, as the impending celebration demands everyone's attention. Wuk Lamat has discovered the entrance to the city of gold and successfully completed the rite of succession."
7,"TEXT_KINGMC113_04909_SEQ_07","Though your questions far outweigh whatever answers you gleaned about the golden city, they will have to wait. For now, your group heads back to Tuliyollal for some well-deserved rest and to celebrate Wuk Lamat's achievements."
