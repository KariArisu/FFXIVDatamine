Sehth Toskh senses a kindred spirit within you."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZJ012_04348_SEQ_01","Sehth Toskh asks that you speak with several dragons who regret to this day that they were not able to join Midgardsormr in his escape, that they might take some comfort in your tales of faraway places.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZJ012_04348_SEQ_02","You speak with two wyrms in Reah Tahra, though the solace they find in your words is somewhat limited by their abiding doldrums. Sehth Toskh has indicated that one more dragon that would benefit from your insight awaits to the southeast..."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZJ012_04348_SEQ_03","You journey toward the vitrified fort only to discover a similarly vitrified dragon, who Sehth Toskh introduces as an old friend who once wished to join Midgardsormr in his journey to a new star. Beleaguered by conquerors from the Alphatron Star as they were, none who would have followed the great wyrm were able to do so, and the life of the dragon before you was tragically cut short─however, Sehth Toskh clearly believes that there is some comfort to be found in the knowledge that their faith was well placed."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZJ012_04348_SEQ_04","Having returned to the marginally less depressing Reah Tahra, Sehth Toskh thanks you for the bit of peace you have brought him by sharing your tidings of Midgardsormr. However grim the history of those in Ultima Thule remains, you too can take comfort in knowing that you have raised at least one dragon's sunken spirits this day."
