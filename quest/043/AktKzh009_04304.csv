49,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_001","It's my job to name the creations brought to us, but I can't seem to decide on one for this particular concept."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_002","It may be because...I'm the one who designed it. It's a species of plant which I intended as a gift for my love. A clear conflict of interest, unfortunately."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_003","My names are always fair and logical and perfectly suited to the creation. But this time, I'm not so sure. I do have a name for it, but what if it's...not suitable? What if it's too personal?"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_004","I thought of discussing the matter with my associates, but my dilemma is far too embarrassing. Would you ask if they think the name is appropriate in my stead? Don't worry─I wouldn't expect you to work without recompense."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_005","This is the creation. A yellow pansy. And the name I have in mind is “mythos.” "
54,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_008","Please ask around and see what people think of the name of my new flower."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_LAMPITO_000_010","Yes, what is it?"
56,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_LAMPITO_000_011","My, what a pretty flower. And you said it was called “mythos”? A fine name."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_LAMPITO_000_012","Many flowers are named with a special feeling in mind, so going by what you've told me, this one is in good company."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_GLAPHYRA_000_013","A familiar? Do you need something?"
59,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_GLAPHYRA_000_014","A flower? It's beautiful! And it smells so lovely. Is it for me?"
60,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_GLAPHYRA_000_015","...Oh. You just want to know if the name is suitable, do you?"
61,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_GLAPHYRA_000_016","Have you tried asking at Ktisis Hyperboreia? No one knows as much about naming as them."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_GLAPHYRA_000_017","Here's a guidebook on the subject. Take it with you, and let your master decide what to do from there."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_LAMPITO_000_020","That flower was clearly named with love. I think it's wonderful."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_GLAPHYRA_000_021","Take that guidebook to your master and see if they want to confer with one of the experts at Ktisis."
65,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_030","How did it go? What did everyone think of the name?"
66,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_031","I see... Well, that is good to know. I won't be needing this guidebook, of course, as I can't very well ask myself for my thoughts."
67,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_032","Or perhaps I should. It wouldn't hurt to have some confidence in the work I do, after all."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_033","As I created this flower, I thought of my beloved, an artist, and the stories she seeks to tell through her plays."
69,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_034","My hope is that, much like a myth or legend, her work is told and retold down through the ages. Hence, “mythos.”"
70,"TEXT_AKTKZH009_04304_NAMER04304_000_035","I've decided. I'll keep the name and submit it to the Bureau of the Architect. Thank you for your help."
