1,"TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_01","Another tower has appeared in Thavnair, and the assistance of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn has been requested. In order to spare you, Thancred, Urianger, and Estinien a time-consuming sea voyage to the distant isle, Krile has secured the aid of the researchers of the Confluence, and thither do you make your way to meet with a woman named Kytte."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_02","Welcoming you excitedly as “test subjects,” Kytte informs you that a new kind of aetheryte has been created that does not require attunement, and that the first pair of prototypes have been installed in Old Sharlayan and Yedlihmad, a port town in Thavnair. Once your preparations are in order, you are to join her at the aetheryte plaza for your journey."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_03","With unsettling nonchalance for what could potentially be a one-way trip into the Lifestream, Kytte sends you and your companions on your way to Thavnair─but not before warning you to expect “a teensy-weensy touch of violent aetherial sickness”..."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_04","No sooner do you emerge in the balmy heat of Thavnair than you are taken by a debilitating wave of the promised sickness. Only Estinien, who had been to the island prior and teleported the tried and trusted way, emerges unscathed. Seeing the state of you and the others, he goes off alone to procure drinks for his ailing comrades─much to Thancred's dismay. Though your stomach roils fiercely at the slightest provocation, the others appear to be faring worse, and so it falls to you to find Estinien before his aggressive indifference to concepts like “budgets” and “crippling debt” lead to a costly mistake.

※In the event that you leave the area and wish to return, speak with Kytte in Old Sharlayan."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_05","By sheer force of will, you manage to reach Estinien just as he is about to be fleeced by a merchant. Yet though you are desperate to warn him as such, you soon realize any words of warning you cry out would be accompanied by your last meal. Instead, you resolve to /deny the deal is fair via a gesture."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_06","Your urgent gesticulations manage to do the trick, alerting Estinien to the merchant's dishonesty. Your comrade agrees to a far more reasonable price for three bottles of amra lassi, which he bids you deliver to Urianger and Thancred."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_07","Urianger receives the lassi with thanks and relief, and you next turn to Thancred to hand him a bottle."
8,"TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_08","The lassi works wonders, and both Urianger and Thancred are soon back on their feet. Alas, though you succeeded in preventing Estinien from one ill-advised purchase, you could not do so a second time, as he returns with his hair bound in an obscenely overpriced length of cord. Though tragic and certain to invoke Tataru's ire, this incident also serves to reveal a trend of opportunistic pricing, which Urianger believes may be due to a dire state of affairs in Radz–at–Han, and it is decided that you will investigate the matter before moving on to seek out Krile's acquaintance."
