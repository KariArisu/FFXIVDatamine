53,"TEXT_AKTKMB112_04391_JULLUS_000_030","As you can see, this place is littered with the remnants of various types of warmachina."
54,"TEXT_AKTKMB112_04391_JULLUS_000_031","While my comrades and I have already recovered the tanks from the less-damaged units, those that took a more severe beating are harder to scavenge. We decided to save those for another time─that time being now."
55,"TEXT_AKTKMB112_04391_JULLUS_000_032","Rather than prise them apart, piece by piece, it would be quicker to remove the outer casing using compact explosives. With luck, we'll gain access to the tanks without rupturing them."
56,"TEXT_AKTKMB112_04391_JULLUS_000_033","Though the force generated by these devices is relatively weak, I would advise you stand well clear to avoid being hit by any shrapnel."
57,"TEXT_AKTKMB112_04391_JULLUS_000_034","Before even bothering, though, you should check the machina's ceruleum gauge to see if there is any left. It should still provide an accurate reading even when the unit itself is inactive."

64,"TEXT_AKTKMB112_04391_JULLUS_000_046","I've a fair amount of explosives to spare today, but tomorrow is another story. We can't afford to waste them on units with nothing to offer, so be sure to check the gauge first."
65,"TEXT_AKTKMB112_04391_JULLUS_000_047","Of course, if the gauge is damaged, it's up to you to make the call."
