49,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_000","Excuse me, you there. You look capable. Could you find a missing Carbuncle for me?"
50,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_001","Ordinarily, a Carbuncle would never be without an arcanist, but this one was found alone, roaming the wilds of La Noscea... And so I had it sent here for research purposes."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_002","I swear I took my eye off it for barely even a moment, and it scampered off somewhere outside the hamlet!"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_003","Seeing as it's far too dangerous out there for someone of my disposition, I was hoping you could look for it in my stead...?"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_004","You have my thanks. I don't think it could have made it out of the Central Circuit, but that still leaves a wide area to search."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_005","This guiding crystal should make the job a bit easier. It will react when the Carbuncle is near, glowing more brightly the closer you are to your quarry."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_006","Once you've secured the entity, please bring it back here to me. I wish you fortune in your hunt!"

58,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_009","That guiding crystal should help you track down the Carbuncle. Be safe and good luck!"
59,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_SYSTEM_000_010","The crystal remains inert. The Carbuncle must be elsewhere."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_SYSTEM_000_011","The crystal twinkles only faintly. Where could that Carbuncle be?"
61,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_SYSTEM_000_012","The crystal glimmers warmly. The Carbuncle isn't here, but you may be on the right track."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_SYSTEM_000_013","The crystal shines brilliantly. The Carbuncle must be nearby."

69,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_022","As I said, they found the poor thing alone in the countryside─wandering the mountains of northern La Noscea, I believe. It should have vanished as soon as its master dismissed it, although it's possible the command was never given."
70,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_023","In which case, it should theoretically persist until the aether that forms it is consumed. But for that reserve to last long enough for the entity to grow wild..."
71,"TEXT_AKTKZI008_04323_RESEARCHER04323_000_024","An immensely talented arcanist must have summoned it. What I wouldn't give to meet someone that powerful!"
