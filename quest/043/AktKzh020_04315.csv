49,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_GLAPHYRA_000_001","Your benevolence does you credit. The researcher I spoke of has striking red hair and is likely lingering on the south side of Kallimelios Zephyros. "
50,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_GLAPHYRA_000_005","You're very good to offer your help in matters you know not what, and for that I thank you. Now, I would give you more specifics, but alas, my red-haired colleague failed to provide them."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_OBSERVER04315_000_010","O-Oh, you're a familiar, aren't you? One sent by Glaphyra, no doubt. Well, thank goodness you're here. I confess I'm still in somewhat of a daze, but with you here I at least feel safe enough to stop and catch my breath."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_OBSERVER04315_000_011","Something came over the specimen I was examining, though I'm not entirely sure what. I'd never seen it behave so erratically before! At any rate, it managed to slip my grasp and escape. I tried to chase after it, but...I'm not half so fleet-footed."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_OBSERVER04315_000_012","To complicate matters, the thing has a very nervous temperament, and will flee if anyone so much as approaches it. I considered imbuing some sort of sleeping spell into a dart which one might shoot from a height, but...who has such impeccable aim? Not I, to be sure─do <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>?"
54,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_OBSERVER04315_000_013","Y-You do? I admit that proposal was made somewhat in jest, but this works out perfectly. So it's settled: you shall put our skittish beast to bed!"

59,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_OBSERVER04315_000_050","How dexterous you must be to hit a moving target with so small an object. Most impressive. Well, allow me to take that dozing specimen off your hands."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_OBSERVER04315_000_060","Why, what a precious sight our little beast makes when it's not running amok. A shame it can't be this adorable all the time..."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_OBSERVER04315_000_061","This was, in fact, one amateur creator's answer to the walking shark that recently gained approval. A somewhat hasty and ill-advised attempt, if you ask me."

63,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_OBSERVER04315_000_063","What it needs is a healthy dose of intellect. I will write a report stating as much. While I do that, return to Glaphyra and tell her of the assistance you rendered. Oh, and offer her my gratitude, too, would you? "

65,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_GLAPHYRA_000_081","A thrilling game of “chase the creation,” was it? That conjures up a sorry image indeed... It sounds like the researcher was able to glean some valuable information, so all's well that ends well, I suppose."
66,"TEXT_AKTKZH020_04315_GLAPHYRA_000_082","If all goes according to the reports made─and sufficient intellect can be cultivated─then the specimen should prove a valuable contribution to our world. Thank you again for your assistance."
