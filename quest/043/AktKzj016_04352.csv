The envious Ea heaves a sigh as they look your body up and down."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_SEQ_01","The envious Ea wants someone to show them how one might move one's corporeal form, in hopes that it might remind them of movements similar to those of the body they once possessed. Visibly perform a gesture of /joy and see if it does not stimulate the Ea's long-dormant memories.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_SEQ_02","Their curiosity regarding bodily movement in a general sense sated, the envious Ea would now learn how fast your arms can move. /slap them silly a bit and see if this does not trigger their imagination."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_SEQ_03","The envious Ea has but one final request of you: to picture in your mind's eye a creature whose shape is similar to that of the Ea. When next you open your eyes you are greeted by a perfect simulacrum of a Namazu...only for the Ea to quickly find that the rotund form is unsustainable. While the experiment was ultimately a failure, the Ea decides to put it aside for now, and is happy to offer you due compensation for your time and effort in engaging with their inquiries."

48,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_000","Ah, look at those rosy cheeks and that sharp silhouette. While our own decision to discard our corporeal forms was of course an enlightened one at the time, I must confess there are some times when I fondly think back on the days when I, too, was a tangible being."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_001","Oh, what I would not give to don proper fleshy raiments once more before I pass into the void! To that end, I have been exploring the possibility of inhabiting another physical form, but...I fear there is a rub. For you see, I cannot for the life of me recall what my true form once was!"
50,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_002","I blame it on the execrable and excruciating flow of time. Alas, I doubt I could even manipulate a body now if I wanted to. Mayhap you might indulge me with a serviceable demonstration?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_003","Your elongated appendages greatly contrast with our current gaseous composition, but I wonder if your general sense of mobility was similar to that of our original physical presences. So let us see it, then! Humor me with a display of sheer joy!"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_005","Go on─use the entire breadth of your unwieldy but somehow charming physique! An exaggerated overture of joy, if you please!"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_SYSTEM_000_006","The Ea eagerly awaits a demonstration of how corporeal beings such as you express happiness.

54,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_010","...Intriguing. You discharge a great sound from your phonatory appendage and make these rather...<Emphasis>suggestive</Emphasis> gestures. Quite different from how we express delight with subtle telepathy."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_011","Now, I would like to replicate the movements in preparation for the next time I meet an innocent and amicable traveler like yourself. Ahem...allow me to try. In the process, I may gain some insight as to whether our erstwhile bodies once moved in a similar manner."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_012","Hmmm...it seems I cannot fully mimic the vocalizations you produce, nor can I garner enough momentum against the air to move my body as quickly. Let me try a different approach."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_013","I feel as though I had a comparable frame, especially those tentacle-esque appendages dangling from your sides. What did you call them again? “Hands,” was it?"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_014","Anyhow, I am curious as to the degree of velocity you can generate with said appendages. Should you be agreeable, I would like you to swing those “hands” with great speed, and strike me with as much force as you can muster!"
59,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_020","Worry not. Being that I have no corporeal form, no manner of physical blow can deal me much harm. Come now! Strike me with your appendage as hard as you can."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_SYSTEM_000_021","The envious Ea would like you to demonstrate the physical limits of your limbs. <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Slap<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> them with as much strength as you can generate."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_030","My word! The impact of that strike was so considerable that I felt it to the very depths of my soul! I can only hope there were no feelings of genuine hatred or indignation behind it."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_031","...But alas, it is no use. Even your most energetic motions seem insufficient to jog my memory. Perhaps our physical frames were not so analogous after all."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_032","If that is the case, I would make one more request of you. You have ventured to many different places and met many different life-forms, have you not? Among the many creatures you have met, is there not one that possessed a similar form to that which you might surmise we once did?"
64,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_Q1_000_100","What will you say?"

67,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_035","Fascinating...if a bit difficult to picture. Mayhap you could hold an image of them in your mind's eye for me? I shall read it and attempt a metamorphosis."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_040","Hrm... Well, they <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> somewhat rotund, and with ocular faculties of a comparable size. Allow me perform a locomotive experiment with this body shape. "
69,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_041","Very well, then. First...a gesture of joy! Then, a vivacious slap to the face!"
70,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_042","Oh...oh! Oh, dear..."
71,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_043","I see that the clammy appendages beside this creature's phonatory apparatus are distinct from the hands that you possess. And somehow, I feel the urge to utilize them despite their absence..."
72,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_044","Given that my immediate synaptic responses are misaligned, it would seem that the erstwhile forms of we Ea are, unfortunately, rather dissimilar from your piscine friends. I apologize for the needless detour."
73,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_045","How bothersome it is to be unable to assimilate with the frame of another creature for lack of memory. It would seem that regaining our physical forms will be even more challenging a task than we originally suspected."
74,"TEXT_AKTKZJ016_04352_EA4352_000_046","While today's experiment has ended in failure, I appreciate the stimulation you have provided me. Take this as compensation for your efforts. Yes, the mind is a fickle thing...I only hope that I will recall what I once looked like while I still possess my mental faculties."
