54,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_RESEARCHERA04301_000_007","I call it the stone mole. It secretes a fluid that eats through solid rock, giving it the ability to burrow into even the hardest terrain."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_RESEARCHERA04301_000_008","It can also toughen its skin by ingesting the rock it has liquefied. Based upon those traits, I humbly request that it be given a good, strong name."

57,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_RESEARCHERB04301_000_010","Of course, you wish to collect my concept. It's this creature I have with me."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_RESEARCHERB04301_000_011","It doesn't have a proper name, as such. From what I hear, the observers have been calling it Notos-642, a nod to the island it resided on. Right, well I'll trust you to put this in Meleagros's hands."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_MELEAGROS_000_015","You've brought the concepts I asked for?"
60,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_MELEAGROS_000_016","Very good. And did you ask for the provisional names?"
61,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_MELEAGROS_000_017","Hm... The “stone mole” and “Notos-642.” And the mole's creator requested that it have a powerful-sounding name? Some researchers do become quite attached to their creations, don't they?"
62,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_MELEAGROS_000_018","It may seem inconsequential, but the appropriate naming of concepts is of the utmost importance. Allow to me to explain."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_MELEAGROS_000_019","Once it has been determined that a creation is beneficial to the star, we can proceed with registering the creator's design with the Bureau of the Architect."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_MELEAGROS_000_020","First, however, the approved concepts must receive their official names. And as a taxonomist, it is my task to bestow them."
65,"TEXT_AKTKZH006_04301_MELEAGROS_000_021","When naming, one must strive for elegance and simplicity, all the while taking care to adhere to existing conventions and avoid repetition. The more creations we name, the more difficult it becomes to maintain this high standard."
