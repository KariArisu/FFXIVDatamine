This mother worries for her child."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZJ014_04350_SEQ_01","A distressed dragon requests you check on her daughter's welfare. Though she does not speak to why her brethren prevent her leaving Reah Tahra, she insists that she cannot go herself, so you accede.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZJ014_04350_SEQ_02","Though you locate the dragon's daughter, she seems entirely unable to interact with her environment. Indeed, you are unsure whether she is alive at all."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZJ014_04350_SEQ_03","You tell the unmoving dragonling's mother what you have witnessed, but she appears incapable of facing the reality of her daughter's condition. She does mention a consort of hers, however, who you duly head off to question."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZJ014_04350_SEQ_04","In speaking to the mother's consort, you learn that her dragonling took the brunt of some manner of laser-based assault during the machine invasion. For reasons that have escaped memory and understanding, she was seemingly frozen in time at that very instant, and has remained hovering on the border between life and death ever since. Confronted with a sight far too disturbing to bear, her mother became obsessed with her child's condition even while persisting in the denial of its truth─a state of affairs which has now culminated in her slipping away from Reah Tahra while you were absorbed in conversation."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZJ014_04350_SEQ_05","You follow the mother to the only place she could have gone, and are confronted with the shocking scene of her corpse. More surprising still are the words that then ring forth, seemingly from her still-static daughter."
6,"TEXT_AKTKZJ014_04350_SEQ_06","The stoic consort finds the daughter's sudden and brief capacity for speech as perplexing as you do. Nevertheless, he believes that your sharing in this tale and its apparent conclusion has brought comfort to all involved."
