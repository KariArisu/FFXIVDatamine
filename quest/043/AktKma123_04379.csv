49,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALPHINAUD_000_010","The attendant was kind enough to give me directions to the High Crucible. First, let us return to the mulberry orchard."
50,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALPHINAUD_000_020","I understand the mulberries are for the silkworms. Grown a stone's throw away from the satrap's residence... It gives it the quintessential Thavnairian flair, don't you think?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALISAIE_000_030","From here, we're supposed to follow the path left and past the mulberries..."
52,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALPHINAUD_000_040","The word Yuj apparently means “bind” in the local tongue, and this district is so named because it connects all others in the city."
53,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALPHINAUD_000_041","If we manage to come this far, we shouldn't have trouble finding the High Crucible─or so I was told."
54,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALISAIE_000_050","Where the street turns, enter the door straight ahead then descend the steps..."
55,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALISAIE_000_051","I thought the Crystarium was confusing, but it doesn't compare to Radz–at–Han. The architecture and decorations make it even harder to get your bearings."
56,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALISAIE_000_052","Anyway, let's see where this door takes us."
57,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALISAIE_000_060","Whew, it seems we're on the right track."
58,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALPHINAUD_000_070","And here is the aetheryte plaza. So far so good, and there isn't much further to go."
59,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALPHINAUD_000_071","From here, we just need to cross to the other side of the hall, then pass through the larger of two doorways. The High Crucible lies beyond."
60,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ALPHINAUD_000_072","I suspect the others have already collected the warding scales. Come, let us join them."
61,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_THANCRED_000_080","You took your time. Got turned around, I take it?"
62,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_URIANGER_000_085","Though this land hath been afforded a respite, in turmoil do many others languish still. Our work is far from finished."

70,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ESTINIEN_000_110","As I heard it, after you defeated Nidhogg, his scales found their way into the hands of the Firmament's artisans."
71,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_ESTINIEN_000_111","Steeped in power as they are, it's no surprise that they were coveted. Still, it is a strange legacy for the vengeful wyrm."

82,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_OJIKATSUNJIKA_000_161","While it isn't much, I've changed your sheets and plumped up your pillow. After all, there's nothing like collapsing in a nice clean bed after completing a major malmstone, be it penning a thesis or defeating deiform entities!"
83,"TEXT_AKTKMA123_04379_OJIKATSUNJIKA_000_162","So, would you like to take a look at your new and improved lodgings now?"
