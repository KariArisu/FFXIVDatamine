N-4486 is searching for a sparring subject."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZK001_04354_SEQ_01","Omicron unit N-4486 requests you fight against an Omicron aggressor to provide valuable combat data. Upon further prompting, it also provides you with a pocket-sized level checker to ensure that said data makes it back in one piece.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZK001_04354_SEQ_02","You do battle with the Omicron aggressor until it is out of commission. As it finishes recording your combat data, the level checker comes to life with an excited beeping, indicating either that you have done quite well, or that it is best handed off to someone with more technological aptitude ere it explodes. Who can say?"
3,"TEXT_AKTKZK001_04354_SEQ_03","N-4486 efficiently analyzes the data before synthesizing a proposal on how the Omicrons might best improve their own strategy. It seems personally keen to see more combat...though at this point, you can hardly claim surprise."
