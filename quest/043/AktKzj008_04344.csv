49,"TEXT_AKTKZJ008_04344_JAWJAADG_000_001","To what end they wait there, I do not know. What I <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> know is that if they do not return to us, their spirit will eventually unravel, leaving them nothing but a wandering entity like those on the outside."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZJ008_04344_JAWJAADG_000_002","And so, I would ask you to summon them back to our abode before they are consigned to such a fate. Can you do this for me?"

54,"TEXT_AKTKZJ008_04344_JAWJAADG_000_003","I have tried, but they do not respond─perhaps my own calls are too weak, or indistinguishable from the surrounding noises. Your voice, needless to say, would produce a more distinct and unusual sound, and thus be more likely to pique their interest. Well, what do you say?"
55,"TEXT_AKTKZJ008_04344_JAWJAADG_000_004","I am much obliged. Simply make for the gate and call out to my friend. Might I suggest a variant of the traditional Ea beckoning? Allow me to demonstrate. Ahem...<Emphasis>coo-ooo-ooo-ooo</Emphasis>!"

63,"TEXT_AKTKZJ008_04344_WAITING04344_000_023","I had stood here for so long, expecting a visitor. Perhaps it is you for whom I have waited. I could see myself ready to greet someone from another world."

68,"TEXT_AKTKZJ008_04344_JAWJAADG_000_032","As such, it is not uncommon for someone to wait at the gates for a guest. Tradition, really. However, my friend─for whatever their reasons─waited overly long. So long that their spirit remembers the act itself, but they have no memory of who they wished to meet there."
69,"TEXT_AKTKZJ008_04344_JAWJAADG_000_033","Now that you have come for them, they feel that they have fulfilled what they set out to do. They have been set free from the lingering thoughts that bound them."

If you had “cue”-d instead of “coo”-ed, it would have been equivalent to telling them that their mind was as empty as a hollow crater─and I doubt they would have been amused."
