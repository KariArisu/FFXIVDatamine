48,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_001","You there! Please, it is most urgent. A colleague of mine in Philomythes Notos has just sent word of a most disturbing nature."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_002","A blue charybdis was practicing its flying, but became separated from its fellows. From what I gathered, based on my friend's manic message, it was last seen taking wing to Peripeteia Krystalline."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_003","We are all of us searching far and wide, but could you look in the direction of Peripeteia Krystalline? Your help will not go unrewarded, I can assure you of that."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_004","Oh, thank you! Between us, we ought to be able to locate this lost creature."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_005","You should know that charybdises have a penchant for heights, so I will scan the skies around here. I leave the upper floors of Peripeteia Krystalline to you."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_006","If you do happen to find the creature I spoke of, use this aetheric rope to bind it. Ah, not to worry: the bindings cause no injury or pain. Good luck, and I shall see you soon."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_SYSTEM_000_010","There is no sign of the charybdis."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_SYSTEM_000_011","The charybdis is nowhere to be seen..."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_SYSTEM_000_012","Now that you've captured the injured charybdis, return to Poieten Oikos and deliver your winged captive to the frazzled researcher."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_020","I saw that you were on your way back, and hastened to return as well. So, what news? Have you found that blue charybdis?"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_021","Oh, a great relief indeed! It's rather impressive it hasn't suffered any truly grievous injuries...and more impressive still that it was able to fly as far as Peripeteia Krystalline."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_022","It had only begun to practice the art of flight recently, as I understand it. Who would have thought it could cross such a distance with wings still so inexperienced? No doubt credit for this ought go to Emet-Selch and his helpful instruction."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_023","Well, I for one cannot wait to see the charybdis take to the skies from its perch. "
61,"TEXT_AKTKZH016_04311_HURRYOBSERVER04311_000_024","At any rate, I will see this creature returned to Anagnorisis at once. Though it isn't much, considering the services you've rendered, I hope it's not too lowly a prize for you."
