56,"TEXT_AKTKZH013_04308_PERIKLES_006","We have a specialist in avian species working with the creation in question, and he can help you with the particulars. You'll find them by the towering structure northeast of our settlement here."

58,"TEXT_AKTKZH013_04308_SYSTEM_008","The bird bears an uncanny resemblance to a shoebill. It doesn't acknowledge your existence."

60,"TEXT_AKTKZH013_04308_BIRDWATCHER04308_010","This here is an abyssus─so named for the way it seems to just...stare off into the abyss. One of our colleagues found it perched on a melanion's antler, and brought it in for closer study."

81,"TEXT_AKTKZH013_04308_BIRDWATCHER04308_028","Perhaps the abyssus only responds to signs of affection. As such, I'll need you to help us experiment a bit more. We'll run dozens of tests, each with a different expression of love!"
82,"TEXT_AKTKZH013_04308_BIRDWATCHER04308_029","...No? Well, I suppose you have other duties to attend to. Still, I'm thrilled we got a reaction out of him. Thank you, and please give Perikles my regards when you go to collect your reward."

86,"TEXT_AKTKZH013_04308_PERIKLES_037","What did you think of the abyssus? Strangely enthralling, isn't it? With those penetrating eyes that seem to stare right into your very core."
87,"TEXT_AKTKZH013_04308_PERIKLES_038","It almost feels like it's studying us as much as we're studying it. I have to wonder who made it, and for what purpose..."
