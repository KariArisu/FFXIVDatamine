50,"TEXT_AKTKMA117_04373_NIDHANA_000_002","The herb grows not far from here, and I would like to go and harvest some. With the recent spate of kidnappings, however, we Arkasodara travel alone at our peril."
51,"TEXT_AKTKMA117_04373_NIDHANA_000_003","Will you not come with me as my escort? I would compensate you for your troubles, of course."

66,"TEXT_AKTKMA117_04373_NIDHANA_000_051","Let us head back to the Great Work, shall we?"
67,"TEXT_AKTKMA117_04373_NIDHANA_000_060","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, my thanks again for your assistance. With your help, we're that little bit closer to completing our talisman!"
