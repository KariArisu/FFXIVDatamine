1,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_01","At the mere mention of Nidhana's name, Matsya begins to gush over the alchemist, whom you gather is also Matanga. With this additional piece of knowledge, you make your way north to the Great Work, where she may be found."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_02","To your shock, you arrive at the Great Work to find its residents collapsed on the ground, though there are no signs of struggle. Spotting whom you believe to be Nidhana, you go to render aid...and are relieved to find that the alchemists are simply in a deep slumber. But no sooner does Varshahn, a servant of the satrap of Radz–at–Han, arrive bearing dragon scales than they are back on their feet again, excited as children with a new toy. The material, Nidhana explains, is vital to their efforts to create a talisman capable of nullifying the tower's corruptive influence. Nidhana then bids you follow her, that she might explain the crux of the situation."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_03","At the behest of the satrap, Nidhana and her alchemists have been laboring to create enchanted talismans that will allow those without innate protection to venture near the tower. This they seek to do by amplifying the superior resistance to disruptive forces that dragon scales possess. Soon they will be ready to conduct a field test, for which they require an individual with the blessing of Light─your good self. For your own safety, however, Nidhana wishes first to confirm how well the blessing shields you, and asks that you meet her on top of a hill just outside the Great Work."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_04","Nidhana explains that you are to follow the peculiarly named “drunken deepa,” a converted lantern which will expose you to powerful blasts of aether. Four blasts should be enough to ascertain the potency of your protection, and Nidhana bids you begin when you are ready.

※You must be following the drunken deepa to complete this task. Speak with it again should you become separated."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_05","You are exposed to the first blast of aether, but are fine as far as you yourself can tell. It should be safe to tell the drunken deepa to continue the test."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_06","You are exposed to another blast of aether, but if there are any problems, you do not feel them yet. Hopefully the third blast will be equally harmless."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_07","You are exposed to a third blast of aether, but your blessing of Light continues to protect you. Just one more blast remains."
8,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_08","You are exposed to the fourth and final blast of aether, and yet again you come out unscathed. The test thus concluded, you go to collect the drunken deepa."
9,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_09","With the drunken deepa in hand, you head back to where Nidhana awaits at the top of the hill."
10,"TEXT_AKTKMA116_04372_SEQ_10","You return the drunken deepa to Nidhana, who is satisfied with the protection the blessing of Light affords you. With this, the alchemists will be able to request your aid for the task ahead with easy hearts."
