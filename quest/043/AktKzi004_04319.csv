51,"TEXT_AKTKZI004_04319_DICKON_000_003","But speaking of busy...we're quite short on hands this shift. As much as I'd hate to bother you, could you deliver an order for me?"

55,"TEXT_AKTKZI004_04319_LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319_000_021","Ah, the sandwiches! How very kind of you to bring them. The Last Stand serves up many scrumptious dishes, but their sandwiches have always been my favorite. My son, meanwhile, was partial to the pretzels."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZI004_04319_LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319_000_022","...When I was young, I attended the Studium. Louisoix was a classmate of mine─a kindred spirit in the study of magic─and we inspired each other to greater heights."

62,"TEXT_AKTKZI004_04319_LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319_000_028","Thank you. Not only for the sandwich, but also for standing with my son to the last."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZI004_04319_DICKON_000_030","Ah, you're back. Did you have a chat with the customer?"
64,"TEXT_AKTKZI004_04319_DICKON_000_031","Wonderful. The gentleman's a regular of ours, you see. When he heard that the Scions had come to Sharlayan, he was beside himself with excitement. He dearly wanted to meet you, but wasn't sure how to go about it."
65,"TEXT_AKTKZI004_04319_DICKON_000_032","So when you appeared when you did, well, I thought I'd make it happen. I appreciate you going along with it."
66,"TEXT_AKTKZI004_04319_DICKON_000_033","By way of thanks, here's a little something on the house. Enjoy!"
