1,"TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_SEQ_01","With a heavy heart, you inform the alchemists of Nidhana's imprisonment within the Tower of Zot. Though saddened, they are resolved to produce as many warding scales as they can, that all those held captive might be saved. Varshahn then arrives bearing messages from the satrap, who invites the Scions to meet with him in Radz–at–Han. You duly accept, and make your way to the gates situated east of the Giantsgall Grounds, on the Perfumed Rise."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_SEQ_02","Varshahn guides you through the city to Meghaduta, the satrap's residence, where you come face-to-face with the man himself, Ahewann. Not to be fooled, however, Estinien demands an end to the charade, and so does the true ruler of Radz–at–Han reveal himself: the great wyrm Vrtra, youngest of the first brood. The people of Ahewann's line have long posed as the satrap, while Varshahn, like other attendants before him, is a simulacrum created to serve as a vessel for the wyrm's will. The true history of Thavnair thus brought to light, Vrtra puts forth a proposal: if the Scions will agree to lead an assault on the Tower of Zot, he will provide them with more warding scales to shield them from its corruption. Though the offer is undeniably attractive, help will likely be required if you are to succeed in the mission, and it is decided that you will return to Sharlayan to confer with the rest of your order."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_SEQ_03","Though the meeting took an unexpected turn, you now have a clear objective ahead of you. Having given everyone a friendly reminder to attune to the local aetheryte, Thancred sets off back to Sharlayan, and you and the others follow."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_SEQ_04","After your eventful sojourn in Thavnair, you find yourself back in Sharlayan for a brief respite, and look to discussing the Tower of Zot with your comrades when the time is right."

57,"TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKB_000_017","The prototype works perfectly. This, Nidhana proved at peril to herself."

69,"TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_THANCRED_000_030","Of the satrap, I only know the common tidbits. That though the position is hereditary, he is not considered a sovereign. And that, despite possessing considerable authority, he wields it sparingly."
70,"TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_THANCRED_000_031","Given the esteem in which the locals hold him, however, it's safe to assume he's good at his job. We could do far worse for an ally."
