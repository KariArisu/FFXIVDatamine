1,"TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_SEQ_01","Lucia tells you that the contingent has made excellent progress in their plans to provide heat and sustenance for the remaining Garleans. As there is nothing so dire as to require your expertise, she asks that you check on Y'shtola."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_SEQ_02","After speaking with Y'shtola, you settle in for a restful supper with comrades old and new. Alas, the moment of peace is shattered by a great wave of aether from the Tower of Babil. Though members of the contingent are protected by their warding scales, the imperials are not so fortunate, and wail as the tempering force begins to twist and torment their minds. You move to help, but are caught off guard by the sudden appearance of Fandaniel, who puts you to sleep and whisks you away...

When you awaken, you find yourself seated at a table set for dinner across from Zenos, as a smirking Fandaniel looks on. It is then you realize that your body is not your own, your soul having been extracted and placed within borrowed flesh. Your hosts then proceed to wax poetic about the primal Anima─summoned with the corpse of Varis himself, Fandaniel reveals─and Zenos's unflagging desire to cross swords with you once again."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_SEQ_03","To spur you to accept his demand for a rematch, Zenos takes control of your true body, and you are forced to pursue him through half of Regio Urbanissima to prevent him from deceiving and harming your comrades. You catch up to him in the nick of time, but it appears there will be no celebrating this small victory, as Fandaniel gleefully announces that the Final Days are soon to begin. Having at last returned to Camp Broken Glass─and yourself─you take a moment to settle back into your body before reassuring your comrades that all is well."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_SEQ_04","Alisaie, like the others, is less than pleased with recent events, and more motivated than ever to put a stop to the cruel machinations of the Telophoroi. The time to defeat Fandaniel and Zenos once and for all draws nigh!"

54,"TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_LUCIA_000_020","Were it not for you, Alphinaud, and Alisaie, the people of Tertium may well have perished. Though they may not realize it yet, they owe you their lives."
55,"TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_YSHTOLA_000_030","Yes, yes, I have been taking proper breaks and imbibing sufficient water. But what of the Warrior of Light? You and the twins have an established history of reckless disregard for your own well-being."
56,"TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_YSHTOLA_000_031","We're all fortunate that none of you landed yourselves in my care. I've already quite enough to deal with, between the tempered and the Ist's wounded."
57,"TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_YSHTOLA_000_032","Alas, though I can mend their bodies, the toll their experiences have taken on their hearts and minds is another matter altogether."

67,"TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_YSHTOLA_000_066","My apologies─I realized too late that the aether emanating from the tower was distorting my perception. 'Twas likely a temporary effect, but I remain wary."
