48,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_000","Greetings, I am a researcher from the Words of Mitron. I've dedicated my life to studying and creating aquatic life, but my main focus is the development of new shark species."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_001","My latest creation has completed its round of observation at Anagnorisis, and will be released after one final test."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_002","The thing is, I'm hoping to consult with a taxonomist before the Bureau of the Architect hands down its official registration."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_003","...The same one who named my last shark, if I can─“speude bradeos” was such a marvelous name."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_004","It turns out it's rather difficult to track down a specific person in a place such as this. Could you help me?"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_005","Thank you. Here, take this─it's a model of the previous creation I just mentioned. Whoever named it should hopefully be able to recognize it."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_008","Show the shark to as many people as you can. Whoever recognizes it must be the one who named it."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_RHODOPIS_000_010","Was there something I could help you with?"
56,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_RHODOPIS_000_011","...Who named this species? I'm sorry but I haven't a clue. Certainly not me."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_EUAION_000_012","What have we here? A roaming familiar?"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_EUAION_000_013","Ah, yes, the speude bradeos. I've heard of it before, but I'm afraid I don't know who named it..."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_TELAMON_000_014","What's that you have there...?"
60,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_TELAMON_000_015","Oh, a speude bradeos! Of course I know it─I named it, after all!"
61,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_TELAMON_000_016","Its creator was calling it a “cladoselache,” but I decided to go with something more closely tied to its distinct way of moving."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_TELAMON_000_017","I wanted to really capture the image of it rushing forward with its tiny steps, somehow swift and slow at once."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_TELAMON_000_018","In case you were curious, the name comes from a proverb meaning “more haste, less speed.”"
64,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_TELAMON_000_019","And if the creator wishes me to name her newest creation, I would of course be honored to do so. It's in Anagnorisis, you say? I look forward to seeing it soon!"
65,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_RHODOPIS_000_020","I honestly have no idea who gave that shark a name."
66,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_EUAION_000_021","That creation is named so perfectly. If only I could come up with something so clever."
67,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_TELAMON_000_022","Oh, I can hardly wait to name this next shark creation!"
68,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_100_025","Any luck finding my taxonomist?"
69,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_030","You found him? And he's willing to give the new one a name, too? That is wonderful news!"
70,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_031","This latest creation is actually a direct improvement over the last. I gave it more legs for a total of eight so it can move even <Emphasis>more</Emphasis> quickly over land."
71,"TEXT_AKTKZH011_04306_CREATOR04306_000_032","With that taken care of, I need to hurry back to Anagnorisis. But before I go... Here. A token of my gratitude."
