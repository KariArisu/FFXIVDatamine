Tatasako appears to be deep in thought as he cranes his neck upward toward the infinite cosmos."

48,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_000","We have staved off calamity, rendering our initial plans of escape rather pointless. Nevertheless, the vastness of space has not lost its intrigue. Indeed, the lunar surface is a land that yet captivates many of us, and some, such as myself, hope to one day journey there."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_001","The end now looms large, its shadow growing longer and more inescapable with each passing day. We must use what little time we have today to think of tomorrow─and the eventuality of a new life on the lunar surface."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_002","Aye, we may soon find ourselves pioneering that rugged, hithertofore unknown terrain. And to do that, we must prepare─and prepare well."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_003","As I understand it, <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> have firsthand experience with that vast emptiness. Perhaps, then, you would be willing to lend us a hand?"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_004","If you are able, I would ask that you slay a center anila and from its carcass retrieve for us its core. So, what say you? Can you help us?"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_005","You will? That is most heartening news. On behalf of all those who will someday step bravely onto that barren, unforgiving land, I thank you."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_006","To think that a person such as you has walked the untraveled grounds of the lunar surface... It is a marvel indeed. I hope that one day very soon we shall follow in your footsteps─literally!"
55,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_010","You've returned, and far sooner than I had anticipated. So, tell me. Have you the core for which I asked?"
56,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_011","Well done. With this, we shall be one step closer to the fruition of our plan. All thanks to you, of course. "
57,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_012","The Loporrits claim that not all of the lunar surface can support life as we understand it. Rather, only certain pockets can be considered hospitable, such as southern Mare Lamentorum."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_013","If we are to explore beyond the reaches of said safe areas, we will need a method by which we can survive those inimical wastelands for more than a few paltry moments."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_014","Fortunately, we are researching one such method as we speak. It involves the storage of air─which is sadly absent up there─compressed into a wearable device which can purify the air expelled by its owner. The core you brought us will be a central component in its development."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_015","It will take some time before our research comes to anything, but rest assured we <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> see it done. And once we have, you will have the honor of knowing you've assisted us in making history! But since that's hardly helpful to you now, here─a reward for your efforts."
