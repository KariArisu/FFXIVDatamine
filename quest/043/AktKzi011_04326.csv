49,"TEXT_AKTKZI011_04326_FJOLA_000_001","I face a trial for which I am not equal, nor shall ever be. It involves the capture of my most feared nemesis: <hurk> tomatoes. You see? I can barely speak the vile beast's name without my gorge rising!"

You'll find them near Meryall Agronomics, and they are quite hard to miss, disgusting things that they are."

55,"TEXT_AKTKZI011_04326_FJOLA_000_013","You must be curious as to why tomatoes maddened into violence were running amok. Well, the truth is, a gleaner had sowed a congeries of vegetable seeds to cultivate on the plantation, and a few of these vermin managed to slip in unnoticed."
