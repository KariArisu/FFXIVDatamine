49,"TEXT_AKTKZJ010_04346_NOHNOOKH_000_001","It is rare to find one so unmarred by the scars of deepest wisdom. Your appearance and perceptions as an outsider differ so much from our own that I wonder if a degree of interaction might prove...<Emphasis>stimulating</Emphasis> for both parties."

51,"TEXT_AKTKZJ010_04346_NOHNOOKH_000_003","In case you are concerned, please know there is no need to be modest when you approach them. They can be quite sociable once they get to know you."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZJ010_04346_MEDITATION4346_000_010","Hm? ...What a curious being you are. Have my peers discovered how to regain their corporeal forms while I remained lost in thought? ...No, of course not. Come to think of it, I wonder if we ever possessed the peculiar form that you now do."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZJ010_04346_MEDITATION4346_000_011","...Oh, dear. I fear this always happens when I delve too deep into such ruminations. The very moment I attempt to regain clarity, it triggers this most unpleasant reaction."

59,"TEXT_AKTKZJ010_04346_MEDITATION4346_000_023","That said, I never imagined you would have such a strange physical form! Pray tell, how do you keep your balance? What keeps your innards from spilling out through one of the multiple orifices in your body?"
60,"TEXT_AKTKZJ010_04346_MEDITATION4346_000_024","...Oh, but pardon me. Truly, I meant no offense. Clearly, life in your world found this shape to be suitable─perhaps even necessary─for your survival. Perhaps our own original form was equally horrifying..."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZJ010_04346_MEDITATION4346_000_025","Seeing you makes me wonder, indeed, what our corporeal forms once looked like. Would our limbs be as lanky and unwieldy? Our heads as bulbous and unbalanced? Perhaps we resembled your kind in more ways than not..."

70,"TEXT_AKTKZJ010_04346_SPENDTIME4346_000_034","Why...precisely! That is the very conclusion I arrived at myself. How heartening─and surprising, I daresay─to meet one as enlightened as myself."
