Boph-bookh is whispering to themselves anxiously."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_SEQ_01","Boph-bookh is at a loss, being unable to find their companion, who seems to have wandered off somewhere. As said companion is the one who shares Boph-bookh's defining memories─and thus the key to their identity─they would have you seek out the stray Ea and see it safely returned to Elegeia. Seek out and tame the wandering Ea, and return it to Elegeia using the psychosuppressive rope.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_SEQ_02","You effectively use the psychosuppressive rope provided to you by Boph-bookh to capture their missing companion. Sadly, it appears that little or nothing remains of the Ea's identity. Nevertheless, you resolve to return the poor creature to Boph-bookh in the hopes that something might yet be done."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_SEQ_03","Faced with the unfortunate state of their friend, Boph-bookh makes the decision to save the lost Ea by merging their remaining memories into Boph-bookh's own. Boph-bookh bids farewell to who they were, with only you to carry on their memory."

49,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_001","Not in a physical sense, of course, as we Ea have transcended our corporeal forms. We do, however, feel the gradual corrosion of our mind, our memories. That which makes us <Emphasis>us</Emphasis>, so to speak."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_002","There are ways, however, to slow this inevitable process. One such method is to come in contact with another, and confirm with each other our defining qualities."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_003","Therein lies my dilemma. For you see, a friend most dear to me is missing, and I fear their absence will only quicken their own passing into nothingness."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_004","It would mean much to me if you could help me find them. Should they be so far gone as to meet you with hostility, simply subdue them and return them to me. Here─you can use this to bind their essence to a retrievable form."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_005","There may yet be hope. They enjoyed taking contemplative strolls at a once-scenic spot on the opposite edge of this landmass. Even if their memories fade, it is likely they might drift in that direction."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_010","I do hope my friend has not wandered too far from our abode. The consequences could be most disastrous..."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_020","I have searched throughout the abode, but my companion is nowhere to be found. I wonder if it is too late..."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_025","The poor thing... To think they were so far gone. Still, I am glad you were able to find them. This will now allow me to absorb what remains of their mind into my own."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_026","There is no cause for alarm. The procedure should have negligible effect on my faculties. If my friend can no longer recognize me, I have no choice but to become host for the memories they themself can no longer recall."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_030","These visions...yes, these are my friend's memories. They have grown faint with the loss of their owner's identity, but they have not yet dissipated completely."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_031","And what is this...? Yes, they still have memories of me. Dim as they are, they now serve to remind me of who I, myself, once was..."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_032","And yet, as the memories come together...the identity that is Boph-bookh begins to flicker and waver. Yes, I must speak the final words that will become my epitaph while I am able. Fortunately, there is someone here who will remember them for me."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_033","In my final moments, I must define myself. I would call myself a realist. Others would call me a coward. Which am I to believe as I become one with the void? And in the end...does it matter?"
62,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_034","Yes, that should do. That said, I feel...most peculiar. I am not of one mind, now, but two. In truth, I am not even sure those words I recited were my own."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_035","All I know is that these words reflect the me that exists now, for I─standing before you─did recite them. And even if one day my identity should dissipate, these words will remain with you as a vestige of what I once was."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_BOPHBOOKH_000_036","That is of some comfort to me, for no one should be forgotten─even if they forget themselves. I hope your own memories will live on long within you, and within those who have shared this existence with you."
