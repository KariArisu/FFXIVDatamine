1,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_SEQ_01","After mulling over what you learned at the Last Stand, Alisaie is convinced that the recent increase in gleaner activity has something to do with the Forum. She urges you to return to Noumenon and share this discovery with the other Scions at once."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_SEQ_02","You relay your suspicions to the others, prompting Alphinaud to reevaluate the situation. Krile subsequently concludes that a journey into Labyrinthos itself is in order. With the next step of the investigation decided, Alisaie offers to lead you to the entrance of what has been described as a vast, underground complex.

※You must be following Alisaie to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_SEQ_03","Following Alisaie's unwavering guidance, you arrive at the Hall of Artifice. Krile waits nearby like an anxious tour guide, counting heads as the Scions gather together."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_SEQ_04","The ever-prepared Krile has secured permission for your group to board the lift in the Hall of Artifice, and there is no time like the present!"
5,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_SEQ_05","You descend into Labyrinthos with Krile and the others. Although momentarily overwhelmed by the sheer scale and ambition of this artificial ecosystem, the demands of the investigation bring you back to your senses. The gleaners scattered about in upper Acrinthos may just have the answers to your questions..."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_SEQ_06","You have spoken to a number of gleaners about their duties in Labyrinthos. Krile should be interested in what you have to report."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_SEQ_07","Krile listens carefully as you repeat the gleaners' words. There certainly seems to be a method to the recent madness, but the precise nature of the Forum's plan has yet to come into focus..."

55,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_YSHTOLA_000_032","It makes sense. The gleaners take their requests directly from institutions and bureaucrats, but as you say, they ultimately answer to the Forum."
56,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_YSHTOLA_000_033","A sudden and significant increase in gleaner traffic and in cargo... It certainly gives the impression of an overarching plan being put into motion."

58,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_ALPHINAUD_000_035","As Y'shtola observed earlier, Noumenon's archives appear to contain no information concerning the Final Days."

60,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_ALPHINAUD_000_037","Yet my father and his colleagues are not only familiar with the Final Days, but are also somehow certain that the destruction being perpetrated by the Telophoroi is wholly unlike these apocalyptic events..."
61,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_ALPHINAUD_000_038","Moreover, the Forum claims to be so occupied by a duty of such pressing importance that they saw fit to unanimously deny Eorzea's request for aid."
62,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_ALPHINAUD_000_039","And now the gleaners, official agents of the state, have been mobilized on an unprecedented scale."
63,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_KRILE_000_040","I do not think it a stretch to conclude that the gleaners' recent activities are in service to the Forum's secretive ends."
64,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_KRILE_000_041","In which case, our next course of action seems obvious: we visit Labyrinthos and assess the situation for ourselves. And if we're lucky, the gleaners will be far more receptive to our questions."

71,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_KRILE_000_048","I understand not everyone is the studious type. Consider this a welcome change of pace, then!"
72,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_GRAHATIA_000_049","As for myself, there are a few more subjects I should like to research. I may join you later, but feel free to leave behind your borrowed books and be on your way. I'll see to it that each is returned to its proper place."

75,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_GRAHATIA_000_060","Watch your step in Labyrinthos. It's rather more perilous than a simple storehouse. Although that will likely make the experience all the more attractive to an adventurer like you!"
76,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_ALISAIE_000_070","Ready? Labyrinthos is not too far from here, but you may find the path a bit disorienting."

81,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_ALPHINAUD_000_080","I've not been to Labyrinthos in the longest time. Even as a student, my visits were few and far between."

90,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_YSHTOLA_000_120","Nay, I am not shirking my duties. I've not been down here in an age, and wished to get my bearings before I went bumbling about."
91,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_YSHTOLA_000_121","From what I can see, however, there is naught obviously out of place. It seems we shall have to resort to discreet inquiries, as usual."
92,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_KRILE_000_125","Most of those gathered here appear to be gleaners. Why don't you wander around and try making small talk?"

108,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_KRILE_000_151","So this grand operation began without warning? And for every item they bring in, they're sending more inventory somewhere else. Hmm... That would explain the haggard faces I've been seeing."
109,"TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_KRILE_000_152","We were right─the Forum is definitely up to something. And they're turning Labyrinthos upside down in the process."
