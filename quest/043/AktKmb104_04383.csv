0,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SEQ_00","Tataru is desperately trying to retain her composure as she prepares to see you off on another perilous journey."
1,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SEQ_01","You stand on the cusp of another adventure into parts unknown, where Tataru's lovingly woven garments may be your only protection against the unforgiving climate of the frozen north. Thankfully, most of the journey will be made by airship, and your pilot stands at the ready."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SEQ_02","Almost immediately after landing in Ilsabard, you are drawn into a confrontation with a sizable force of tempered imperials. Thancred's bravery and ingenuity are instrumental in tipping the scales in your favor, although Vergilia and her IIIrd Legion troops prove stiff opposition nonetheless. Having taken them into custody in order to cure them of their tempering, your contingent marches onward to Garlemald."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SEQ_03","Your party decides to make use of an abandoned village to establish a temporary base of operations, which is granted the moniker of Camp Broken Glass for the constant sound of ice cracking underfoot.

※You can now travel to Garlemald by speaking with the Ironworks pilot in the Ala Mhigan Quarter."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SEQ_04","With the airships safely moored and the tempered imperials receiving treatment, Alphinaud informs you that Lucia wishes to decide on a course of action with the Scions. Before that, you must round up Y'shtola and G'raha Tia, who have been exploring the vicinity."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SEQ_05","Y'shtola is particularly sensitive to disturbances in ambient aether, and since drawing close to the imperial capital, she has been beset by a strange malaise. She posits that it is likely caused by the monstrous tower looming on the horizon, where she senses vast amounts of aether gathering. Fortunately, she should still be well enough to participate in the meeting, and she agrees to join you soon."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SEQ_06","G'raha Tia has busied himself investigating the nearby residences, and his findings strongly suggest that much, if not all of the local populace, has been tempered. Without any villagers present to verify this theory, however, the current evidence can only be considered circumstantial at best. Putting aside his work for the time being, he makes his way towards the meeting place."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SEQ_07","Now that you have successfully infiltrated Garlemald, Lucia outlines the contingent's plans for scouting the vicinity. She assigns you, Alisaie, and Alphinaud the task of searching for survivors in the outskirts of the capital, which despite being within the city walls, are largely covered in vast swathes of ice and snow."
8,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SEQ_08","Alisaie, like many members of the contingent, has yet to acclimatize herself to the unrelenting cold of Ilsabard. As she points out, even the people of Garlemald would soon perish in such conditions if deprived of warmth. Though you know not what awaits in the frozen wastes, you grit your teeth and prepare to venture forth."

55,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_GARLONDPILOT_000_020","It's an honor to finally meet you! We of the Garlond Ironworks will be ferrying you and your contingent across the mountains and into Garlemald."
56,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_GARLONDPILOT_000_021","For many of us, it will be something of a homecoming. Our illustrious founder was only our most notable imperial defector."
57,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_GARLONDPILOT_000_022","For that reason, the company is committed to the success of this expedition."
58,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_GARLONDPILOT_000_023","Our resources are at your disposal, and if there is aught we might do to be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to ask!"

It is recommended that you set aside sufficient time to view these scenes in their entirety."
61,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_026","In addition, you will be required to participate in battle. Your progress will be saved at certain points. In the event that you are defeated, you will be able to try again from the most recent of these."

63,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_030","In the coming battle, you will fight as Thancred. You have two objectives:
1. Place explosives on the imperial magitek.
2. Deactivate the frontline magitek units via the control terminal."
64,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_031","If the guards detect and pursue you, enemy forces will become more aware of the threat you pose, as indicated by the threat awareness gauge."
65,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_032","The gauge will gradually fill until you defeat all alerted enemies."
66,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_033","If the gauge is completely filled, the guards will call for reinforcements and the mission will end in failure."
67,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_034","Use Swift Deception to avoid detection as you go about completing your objectives."
68,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_040","Success in this mission hinges on the following points:"
69,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_041","Swift Deception renders Thancred invisible and increases his movement speed."
70,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_042","While active, enemy soldiers and magitek will be unable to perceive Thancred's presence, even if they are within close proximity. However, it has no effect on the guard dogs' acute sense of smell, and they will be able to detect Thancred regardless."
71,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_043","Moreover, this action can only be used outside of combat. It will also be unavailable when Thancred attempts to deactivate magitek fields or execute certain other actions."
72,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_044","Thancred's Silent Takedown will instantly render a soldier unconscious. It can only be used while Swift Deception is in effect."
73,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_045","Though it cannot be used on magitek or guard dogs, utilizing Silent Takedown whenever possible is essential in clearing a path to your objectives."
74,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_046","As guard dogs can detect Thancred even when Swift Deception is active, you can instead use a Bewilderment Bomb to distract them and sneak past unnoticed."
75,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_047","Conversely, Bewilderment Bombs have no effect on magitek or soldiers, so take care to choose the right tool for the situation."
76,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_SYSTEM_000_048","You must be a Disciple of War or Magic of level 82 or above to proceed."

86,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_PIPIN_000_085","We've asked the Ironworks members and some of our other comrades to stay with the airships. In the event we are discovered, we must be ready to move them swiftly to a safer location."
87,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_LYSE_000_090","Raubahn taught me a lot about military strategy during exercises in the Fringes. Coordinating units with wildly different capabilities, surveying and securing hostile terrain, that sort of thing. Now, I have the chance to put his teachings into practice."
88,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_CIRINA_000_095","Vergilia is in our care, along with the rest of the tempered. “Glory to Garlemald, glory to Garlemald,” they still whisper in their sleep, even as they writhe in pain..."
89,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_ALPHINAUD_000_100","In spite of the obstacles we've faced, our plan proceeds apace. Just a little farther and we will reach the capital itself."
90,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_ALPHINAUD_000_101","Still, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. As soon as the camp has been made fit for purpose, we are to discuss a course of action with Lucia."
91,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_ALPHINAUD_000_102","Would you mind asking Y'shtola and G'raha to join us in that building to the northeast of the camp? Alisaie and I will meet you there."

95,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_YSHTOLA_000_113","Much like the sensation I felt in the Tower of Zot, only far more terrifying. Aether flows unceasingly towards it, converging into a swirling mass of unfathomable power."
96,"TEXT_AKTKMB104_04383_YSHTOLA_000_114","...For a blessing, the constant chill in the air is helping to anchor my senses in the here and now. Tell the others I shall be with you in a few moments."
