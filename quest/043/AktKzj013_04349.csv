The old wyrm is displeased at the state of the spring."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZJ013_04349_SEQ_01","The old wyrm tells you of his wish to restore the spring at the center of Reah Tahra to its former potable glory. As the dragons apparently have a rather unusual means of cleansing their water supplies, you are summarily tasked with finding a dragon who yet retains a loud voice to roar at it.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZJ013_04349_SEQ_02","Some small distance from Reah Tahra, you find a bloodthirsty dragon, who you manage to goad into accompanying you back to the spring. As the dragon is unwilling to wait for your tiny legs to carry you there, however, you must take the risk of approaching...

※Speak to the bloodthirsty dragon in Ostrakon Deka-okto to mount."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZJ013_04349_SEQ_03","The dragon roars by the spring to little apparent effect, but is willing to make one more attempt in the name of impressing upon you how fruitless your efforts are.

※Speak to the bloodthirsty dragon in Ostrakon Deka-okto to mount."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZJ013_04349_SEQ_04","Though there is no perceivable difference in the spring's appearance upon exposure to a second roar, the old wyrm remarks that it tastes slightly better than it did. Surprisingly, even the bloodthirsty dragon grudgingly admits that your efforts were not entirely in vain─albeit for somewhat more egotistical reasons."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZJ013_04349_SEQ_05","Upon speaking with him further, the old wyrm remarks that he finds himself both nostalgic and hopeful at his fellow's roar having wrought even a minor change. He departs to spread the news to the other dragons, who perhaps will be inspired to sing proudly once more."
