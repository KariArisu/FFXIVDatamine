1,"TEXT_AKTKBA251_04113_SEQ_01","You find Raubahn engaged in an urgent linkpearl conversation with M'naago, whose search party has finally made contact with the errant Fordola. As previously surmised, she has been on the trail of her friend Charlet, with the intention of slaying him following his irreversible transformation into a blasphemy. Although she successfully predicted where the beast would appear, Fordola was soon spotted by Charlet, who turned and fled in the direction of Specula Imperatoris. Raubahn orders the troops to prevent the blasphemy from escaping until the two of you arrive."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA251_04113_SEQ_02","In the time taken for you and Raubahn to reach Specula Imperatoris, M'naago and her team have been pushed to their limits by the rampaging Charlet, with only Fordola still fit to fight. She, however, faces an entirely different struggle, as her guilt for her part in the deaths of Charlet's brother and the Crania Lupi threatens to overwhelm her, and it is only the unexpected pleas of M'naago and the surprising arrival of Arenvald that pull her back from the brink. Her resolve renewed, she leads the charge against Charlet, and with support from you and the Bull of Ala Mhigo, she finally lays her childhood friend to rest."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA251_04113_SEQ_03","You and your comrades are given a warm reception upon returning to the city. Even Fordola, the reviled war criminal, receives a hero's welcome from Lylie, the child whose life she had saved. In light of her continued service to Ala Mhigo, Raubahn intends to have the restrictions to her freedom eased to a degree. The suggestion that she may no longer be required to wear the enchanted choker─capable of claiming her life should she attempt to flee─elicits little in the way of an outward response, though you suspect this comes as welcome news all the same."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA251_04113_SEQ_04","Raubahn offers his thanks for your cooperation in hunting down the blasphemy and the various services performed for the sake of Ala Mhigo. Before departing, he asks that you share your account with the ambassador to Radz-at-Han, who will be eager to hear of your exploits."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA251_04113_SEQ_05","The ambassador and his Ul'dahn counterpart are─as one might expect─delighted to hear firsthand accounts of your triumphs. Having played an instrumental role in helping his countrymen overcome this recent crisis and begin to come to terms with their bloody past, you take a moment's repose before embarking on your next adventure."
