1,"TEXT_AKTKBA301_04114_SEQ_01","A blasphemy, one of the fell beasts that portend the Final Days, has been sighted off the coast of Vylbrand. Admiral Bloefhiswyn has already begun to take action to deal with the threat, and she would have you join in the effort. At the official's behest, you agree to travel to Limsa and lend what aid you can."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA301_04114_SEQ_02","The situation in Limsa Lominsa is not entirely grim, for the secretariat at Maelstrom Command informs you that an increasing number of Sahagin have been freed from primal enthrallment and now seek peaceful relations with their neighbors. It is these newfound allies whose help Merlwyb would enlist in further assessing the situation, and she requests you accompany her to a meeting at South Tidegate."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA301_04114_SEQ_03","You rendezvous with Merlwyb at South Tidegate, but─troublingly─your Sahagin allies are nowhere to be found. Fearing for their safety, Merlwyb makes for nearby Halfstone in search of them."

6,"TEXT_AKTKBA301_04114_SEQ_06","Noll, who is shaken but otherwise no worse for the wear, thanks you profoundly for saving his life. Helping him to his feet, you set off to rejoin Merlwyb, who is fighting her own battle a short distance away."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA301_04114_SEQ_07","Safe from danger for the moment, you return with Merlwyb and the Sahagin pair to South Tidegate. It is there that Noll confirms that the selfsame horror you witnessed at Radz–at–Han has come to Vylbrand, and that the beasts you dispatched were once his very own spawnbrothers. Noll further explains that these latest victims were affiliated with the Crushing Tide─a Sahagin faction that rejects efforts to make peace with Limsa. With a fuller understanding of the dangers his people face, Noll returns home, while you and Merlwyb agree to meet back at Maelstrom Command to discuss your next course of action."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBA301_04114_SEQ_08","Back at Maelstrom Command, Merlwyb resolves to put the knowledge she has gleaned from you and Noll to full use in bringing a swift end to the blasphemy. Vowing to do your part, you take your leave until your next course of action is decided upon.
