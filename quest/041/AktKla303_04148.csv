49,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_100_000","I've been researching the subject of texture, and I think I've found the cause of our powdery problem."
50,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_001","The answer lies in the yeast. It seems the sugar content of the sweetener weakened its usual effects, preventing the dough from being fully leavened."
51,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_002","Which means that if we can create a yeast more properly suited to sweetened dough, then our bread will be as moist as we care to make it!"
52,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_003","Knowing, however, is not quite the same as doing. While I understand the basics, formulating yeast from scratch is rather beyond my current abilities..."
53,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_004","Once more, I must call upon you to “rise” to the occasion! Ahem, sorry..."

55,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_010","I'm afraid our bread will never be all that it can be if we cannot solve this yeastly dilemma..."
56,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_020","Wonderful! If my reasoning is correct, then this yeast should be compatible with our sweet dough."
57,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_021","Now this is some potent-looking yeast! Trust me, after the hours I spent staring at such things during my studies, the quality is obvious!"
58,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_030","Thanks to all your hard work, the third test batch of panaloaf turned out just as moist as we'd hoped!"
59,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_100_030","And all without compromising the original integrity of its nutritional content."
60,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_031","It was well received by the clientele at the Last Stand, and even our difficult-to-please regular gave it his seal of approval."
61,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_032","I would, however, like to hear the opinion of the─to my knowledge─foremost gourmand in Sharlayan."
62,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_033","I speak of Master Dickon, the owner of the Last Stand. Everything I know about gourmet cooking, I owe to that man. Come, why don't we go and see what he has to say?"

65,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DICKON_000_036","Certainly a far cry from what you started with─that very first sample tasted like a sponge fished out of a sewer ditch. I expect you have your new friend to thank for this sudden leap in progress...?"

68,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_A1_000_002","I swore a vendetta against that foul-tasting evil!"
69,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_037","I could hardly have done it alone! Without your practical talents, I would still be stuck daydreaming by the oven."
70,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_038","Oh, my dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, you are a gourmet after my own heart─a crusader for culinary quality!"
71,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DICKON_000_039","Be that as it may, you yet have work to do. You've worked wonders with the taste and the texture, but there's no <Emphasis>aroma</Emphasis>. It needs a savory scent to draw you in, and set your mouth to watering."
72,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_040","So it isn't...smelly enough."
73,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_041","The road to gastronomic excellence is never-ending, it seems. But if that is what it takes to earn your full approval, then we must bake on!"
74,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DICKON_000_042","Ah, you remind me of old Mervyn. He was the fellow who built this place, and dedicated his life to bringing fine food to Sharlayan."
75,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DICKON_000_043","That life ended before he'd truly accomplished his goal, and the Last Stand passed on to me. Even now, gourmet cooking remains something of a foreign concept in this nation."
76,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DICKON_000_044","It's the kind of place where puffed-up experts like your professor label their nutritional experiments the “perfect meal.” As if anything with such a revolting flavor could ever be deemed perfect!"
77,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DICKON_000_045","Listen, the Last Stand was named so for a reason. We're a cultural outpost─the final defense against those who would condemn Sharlayan's diet to blandness and monotony!"
78,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DICKON_100_045","If you share Mervyn's dream─and I believe you do─then I implore you to carry on his legacy!"
79,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_046","After hearing what Master Dickon had to say, I'm more determined than ever to make a truly perfected panaloaf!"
80,"TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_047","As before, allow me some time to cogitate on the problem, and then we can see about adding a tantalizing aroma to the next batch of bread."
