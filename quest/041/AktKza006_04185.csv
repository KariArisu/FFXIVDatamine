54,"TEXT_AKTKZA006_04185_NONOLATO_100_004","Wh-Why, you ask? Well, because I... I have an urgent matter to attend to elsewhere! Yes, very urgent and very far from here!"

56,"TEXT_AKTKZA006_04185_NONOLATO_100_006","I'll be waiting right here! Er, that is, I will be after I've completed my other extremely pressing errand which prevents me from doing this one."
