53,"TEXT_AKTKZA004_04183_TINYMIQOTE_000_003","That's right. All I did was lend him a little aether, and he hopped up and dashed off down the street. Mama and Papa bought him for me as a special gift─now I've gone and lost him!"
54,"TEXT_AKTKZA004_04183_TINYMIQOTE_000_004","They'll be furious with me for losing the toy I kept asking for, so please...you have to help me find him!"

57,"TEXT_AKTKZA004_04183_SYSTEM_000_007","You find a yellow Carbuncle doll. Lifelike expressions aside, it appears to be otherwise motionless... Return to Journey's End, and deliver him to the mischievous Miqo'te."

61,"TEXT_AKTKZA004_04183_TINYMIQOTE_000_011","She'd tell me stories about her friend─a powerful wizard─who could summon his very own Carbuncle companion. That's why I wanted one for myself!"
62,"TEXT_AKTKZA004_04183_TINYMIQOTE_000_012","I have to learn how to move him around better, though, so that when Moony comes back she can see how hard I've been practicing my magicks!"
