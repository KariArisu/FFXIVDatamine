48,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_TOFFWYB_000_001","Are you... Are you one of those adventuring types I've heard so much about!? Oh, but this is perfect! I just happen to have an errand of the kind that adventurers love! Or so I'm told."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_TOFFWYB_000_002","I'm holding on to some volumes my customers ordered in, but instead of coming to pick them up, they've all decided that they want their goods delivered. So, I find myself in need of a delivery drudge...er, person. Might that person be you!?"
50,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_TOFFWYB_000_003","Huzzah! Let me give you the details, then. All in all, there are three books on the delivery docket."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_TOFFWYB_000_004","The first, <Emphasis>Ishgardian Astrology: A Comprehensive Theory</Emphasis>, should be handed to the servant at Albright Manor. <Emphasis>The White Yonder</Emphasis> is for a certain talkative booklover who you'll know by the constant stream of chatter. And the last, <Emphasis>Narrow Road through the Deep Grass</Emphasis>, goes to one of the toughest, most unflappable gleaners I have ever met."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_TOFFWYB_000_005","I'll just mark their locations on this handy map...like so. The books are bought and paid for─no need to collect any coin─but do return to me for your own reward!"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_TOFFWYB_000_006","If you just throw the books in the harbor, I <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> find out. Not that I think you would! ...I'm watching you."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_MAIDINSEVESTRE_000_007","Welcome to Albright Manor! ...Do you have an appointment?"
55,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_MAIDINSEVESTRE_000_008","Ah, yes, one copy of <Emphasis>Ishgardian Astrology: A Comprehensive Theory</Emphasis>, just as his lordship requested."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_MAIDINSEVESTRE_000_009","I must confess to some confusion, however... What interest would his lordship, an esteemed practitioner of Sharlayan astrology, have in such an outdated Ishgardian discipline?"
57,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_MAIDINSEVESTRE_000_010","...Not that I am in any position to question his lordship's reading habits, of course. Ahem. On your way, then."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_CHATTYBIBLIOPHILIA_000_011","Please tell me you've brought my new book! I've been waiting for what feels like <Emphasis>ages</Emphasis> for the latest shipment to arrive!"
59,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_CHATTYBIBLIOPHILIA_000_012","Yes! Finally! Did you know <Emphasis>The White Yonder</Emphasis> was written by a lad of fourteen years? I myself questioned how reliable such a work could possibly be, but a Far Eastern colleague with whom I've been exchanging correspondence says he absolutely swears by it."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_CHATTYBIBLIOPHILIA_000_013","It describes the wonders of the Abalathian Sea of Clouds in exquisite detail, and is, by all accounts, a roaring good read. The bit about the fighting paissas is said to be an especially entertaining episode."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_CHATTYBIBLIOPHILIA_000_014","Well, I should let you return to your deliveries and whatnot. Thank you kindly for putting this long-awaited treat into my ever-so-grateful hands!"
62,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_FEARLESSGLEANER_000_015","...Something I can help you with?"
63,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_FEARLESSGLEANER_000_016","Ah, is that my book? Good. I need it for my journey."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_FEARLESSGLEANER_000_017","I usually don't have a great deal of time for reading, but as I'm leaving for Othard on requisition duty, I wanted to do some research on Far Eastern cultures. I know little of the peoples of the Azim Steppe..."
65,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_FEARLESSGLEANER_000_018","Hm... It says here that “there are fifty-one distinct Xaela tribes, each with their own customs and traditions. The Buduga, for example, are exclusively male, and are known for kidnapping male outsiders to replenish lost numbers...”"
66,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_FEARLESSGLEANER_000_019","Is...is this accurate!? I'll need to tread carefully, it seems. Thank you for the timely delivery."
67,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_TOFFWYB_000_020","All safely delivered? Hah! Of course they were!"
68,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_TOFFWYB_000_021","My shop is well known for carrying publications not only from Sharlayan authors, but from all manner of foreign chroniclers and tale-tellers. Meaning every time a new shipment comes in, I'm faced with an avalanche of work."
69,"TEXT_AKTKZA003_04182_TOFFWYB_000_022","I would've been buried alive without your assistance today, so here's a little something to show my gratitude. Go on, you've earned it!"
