1,"TEXT_AKTKBA401_04120_SEQ_01","At the mere sight of you, the Doman delegate is equal parts excited and relieved. As he tells it, dread beasts heralding the Final Days have begun to manifest in Doma, following the appearance of a blasphemy. Though they have made great strides in slaying the lesser creatures, the greater threat continues to elude them, keeping to the heavens and beyond the reach of their samurai and shinobi. To that end, Lord Hien seeks a marksman able to pluck the beast from the sky. You agree to answer their call for aid, and so he begs you make for the Doman Enclave, where Yugiri will receive you."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA401_04120_SEQ_02","Your discussion with Hien and Yugiri is cut short when a vexed villager interrupts with grave news. A young man of Namai recently transformed into a terrible beast, inciting panic in the people as it fled. Hien would take swift action in slaying the creature, and so he and Yugiri leave with the villager for the Glittering Basin, and you are to follow."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA401_04120_SEQ_03","There is nothing to be seen when you arrive at the Glittering Basin, and so Hien suggests you split up to cover more ground. He bids you search to the west, reminding you not to hesitate in slaying the beast should you find it first."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA401_04120_SEQ_04","You find the beast preparing to sink its fangs into a frightened young boy. Thanks to your timely arrival, and unmatched martial prowess, its meal is denied. All that remains is to ensure the boy is unharmed."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA401_04120_SEQ_05","Much to the surprise of all, the young boy is not thankful, but furious as he accuses you of killing his brother. He runs off in a huff, and shortly after Isse arrives. It would seem that the young boy, Tonbo, pursued the beast born of his sibling when it fled their village, and Isse gave chase to ensure he did not come to harm. He goes on to explain the circumstances that have left the people of his village, and perhaps all of Doma, in the grips of despair. The youth's account gives Hien much to consider as you all return to the Doman Enclave."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA401_04120_SEQ_06","Hien has a mind to visit the villages of Doma personally and inquire after those whom their neighbors believe are more distressed of late─individuals that he fears may be at risk of sharing in the fate of Tonbo's brother. Meanwhile, Yugiri and the other shinobi will continue to hunt the blasphemy that yet eludes them. Until more is known, Hien bids you rest, that you may be ready and able to aid them once more.

※The next role quest will be available from Yugiri upon reaching level 86 in any physical ranged DPS class."

66,"TEXT_AKTKBA401_04120_HIEN_000_029","From what I understand, this phenomenon is not unlike a sickness which spreads by feeding on fear and anxiety. Emotions which, of late, can be found in abundance. Slaying the beasts means nothing if the peoples' hearts cannot be put at ease."
