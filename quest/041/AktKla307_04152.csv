Debroye turns to you after hearing the decision, ready to share her elation."
3,"TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_SEQ_03","Although overjoyed at her victory, Debroye finds herself sympathetic to Professor Galveroche's disappointment. She asks that you meet her at the Last Stand, and help her prepare a meal that is sure to lift his spirits."

Your task is to create one of the dish's most vital ingredients, and deliver it to Debroye so that she might assemble the professor's uplifting meal.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Dickon."
5,"TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_SEQ_05","You deliver the key ingredient to Debroye, and she finishes preparing the aforementioned fishcake dish. A wary Professor Galveroche arrives soon after, only to find himself pleasantly surprised by the meal and how much he enjoys it. Transported to the past by the familiar flavors, he speaks of his efforts to save Mervyn, and of his misplaced anger towards gourmet cooking. In the end, he concedes the importance of taste in the science of nutrition, vowing to create a meal that exceeds even the divine deliciousness of Mervynbread. By the look on Debroye's face, his change in attitude was perhaps the greatest victory of all."
6,"TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_SEQ_06","Debroye thanks you profusely for your assistance in her quest to create the perfect meal. With Professor Galveroche now joining her on the road of taste-related research, she vows to continue her mission to find acceptance for fine dining in the hearts─and bellies─of Sharlayan's citizens."
