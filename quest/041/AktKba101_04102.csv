1,"TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_01","A blasphemy has made the Twelveswood its lair, stalking its denizens and casting a dark pall over the entire region. It has proven difficult to track, and so the Adders' Nest has requested the help of a fearless defender to help protect their soldiers during the hunt. You are to report to the Adders' Nest at once."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_02","The effort to find the blasphemy is being led by none other than the Elder Seedseer herself, Kan–E–Senna. She explains that their troubles began after an unidentified man transformed into a hideous beast which the people dubbed Gleipnir─so named for its similarity to a creature of legend which bears chain-like patterns on its hide. Its claws and horns appear to be coated with a potent poison that causes these selfsame patterns to manifest on an injured victim's skin. This mark is disturbingly similar to one caused by an infamous sickness known as the Creeping Death. Alas, unlike the sickness, those poisoned by Gleipnir cannot be cured by medicine or magick. This leaves you with few options to combat the beast, and as you contemplate this problem, Kan–E's attendant receives a chilling message via linkpearl: Gleipnir has struck again. Fortunately, the victim yet lives and is being conveyed to Fallgourd Float, and so the Elder Seedseer bids you accompany her to the settlement and speak with Aethelmaer, its overseer."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_03","Aethelmaer informs you that the man is being treated by a Hearer outside of the Bobbing Cork. The healer is doing what he can, but the Elder Seedseer should surely be capable of doing more. Suspecting she may require a pair of helping hands, she asks you to follow her to the inn."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_04","The Fallgourd Hearer is doing his utmost to keep the man alive, but the poison frustrates his efforts. No sooner does Kan–E–Senna approach to attend the man than you hear a shout from nearby─a man yelling about an approaching swarm of chigoes. The vilekin are known to carry the Creeping Death, and the Hearer fears that allowing them into Fallgourd Float would spark panic among its people. The Elder Seedseer bids you investigate and resolve the situation if you can."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_05","The unharmed but distressed man warns of a mass of chigoes near Alder Springs. Fallgourd Float has few Wailers to spare, and so it falls upon you and the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents to combat this menace."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_06","When the dust has settled, countless chigoes lie dead at your feet, and the forest is much quieter for your efforts. Cowering before you is a man who was but moments before smothered in a crush of wings, and still very much in need of assistance."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_07","The flustered man is none the worse for wear, and he proceeds to tell you that he was accosted by the swarm while on his way to deliver medicine used to treat the Creeping Death to Fallgourd Float. While it is unclear whether the man was originally driven by opportunism or altruism, out of gratitude he offers you his wares free of charge. Gleipnir's poison still courses through the victim's veins, and so you must make haste to Fallgourd Float with the potential cure."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_08","Although Kan–E–Senna administers the medicine to the sick man, he is soon overcome with convulsions before, with a final cry of pain, he at last dies. The distraught Elder Seedseer strives not to let her emotions cloud her judgment, and concludes that Gleipnir's poison must be far too powerful to be carried by chigoes or any other ordinary creature; the people need only ware the blasphemy. While this knowledge comes as a relief of sorts, you are no closer to stopping the blasphemy. The beast must first be found, and to that end the Elder Seedseer suggests returning to the Adders' Nest to scour recent reports for any new information."
9,"TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_09","Indeed, in your absence many sightings of Gleipnir have been reported all throughout the Twelveswood. However, when panic clouds judgment, a rabbit in the brush is often mistaken for something much more sinister. The Order of the Twin Adder must nevertheless carefully consider every report and determine which merit further investigation. And so, Kan–E's attendant asks that you stay safe in the meantime.

※The next role quest will be available from the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents upon reaching level 86 in any tank class."
