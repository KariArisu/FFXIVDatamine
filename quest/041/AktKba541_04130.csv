1,"TEXT_AKTKBA541_04130_SEQ_01","With an air of solemnity, Artoirel informs you that the ecumenical council will soon be held. This council, he explains, is the highest assembly in the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, where participants gather to deliberate and decide upon changes to church doctrine. Traditionally, only the archbishop and the members of the Synod sit in attendance, but on this occasion the doors will be thrown open to the general public. While Artoirel and Clem go on ahead to the Vault, you are tasked with fetching Aymeric, who has headed to the Last Vigil to gather his thoughts ahead of this momentous event."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA541_04130_SEQ_02","You find Aymeric deep in thought, pondering the difficult choices he has made, and what he must do in order to build a united Ishgard for one and all. With the appointed hour nigh, he suggests that you begin making your way to the Vault together."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA541_04130_SEQ_03","You begin walking with Aymeric to the Vault, and at his behest first head to Fortemps Manor.

※You must be accompanied by Aymeric to complete this task. Speak with him again at the Last Vigil should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA541_04130_SEQ_04","Standing before Fortemps Manor, Aymeric fondly recalls your time as wards of House Fortemps, and thanks you again for the many changes you set in motion by coming to Ishgard. You then set out once more, next making for the Architects."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA541_04130_SEQ_05","Pausing at the Architects, Aymeric reflects upon the crimes of the founding fathers. If Ishgard is to forge a new future, he declares, it must decide how it will confront its complicated past. His musings thus concluded, the two of you continue on to join Clem at the Vault."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA541_04130_SEQ_06","Thus does the ecumenical council commence─the first in generations and first ever with the general public in attendance. Friction is initially evident between opposing factions of the clergy, but thanks to your companions' sage mediation and guidance, they are able to find common ground. In renewing their commitment to their shared faith in Halone and acknowledging the mistakes of the past, the church shall take its first step towards reform, that it might again serve as a beacon of hope for the people.

※In the event that you leave the strategy room, you may re-enter by speaking with the Temple Knight guard at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA541_04130_SEQ_07","Back at the Congregation, you and your companions share your relief at the success of the council. Now that the church has seemingly weathered the worst of this crisis, you may turn your attention wholly upon the task of dealing with Profane Fafnir.

※The next role quest will be available from Artoirel upon reaching level 90 in any magical ranged DPS class."
