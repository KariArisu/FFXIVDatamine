49,"TEXT_AKTKZA013_04192_JONQUINET_000_001","The task is a simple one, rest assured. You need only plant these experimental seeds in the nearby fields. You would be compensated for your troubles, of course."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZA013_04192_JONQUINET_000_002","No special skills are required of you. If you've planted one seed, you've planted most of them. Well then, I look forward to seeing what you can do."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZA013_04192_JONQUINET_000_003","You have the seeds, yes? I expect you know what to do with them. If not, well...I'm afraid we may have more troubling issues at hand."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZA013_04192_JONQUINET_000_010","Slightly flushed, are you? Good. I take it that means you've planted the seeds. You have my thanks, and if all goes to plan, the realm's as well."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZA013_04192_JONQUINET_000_011","You see, my research involves the production of nutrient-rich plants that can be harvested in greater numbers than any we have seen thus far."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZA013_04192_JONQUINET_000_012","However, even the most extraordinary crop is useless if they cannot be planted and raised by the common <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZA013_04192_JONQUINET_000_013","I've long made ease of use a priority when I develop new seeds, asking everyone from experienced researchers to eager children to plant them in the earth and then comparing results."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZA013_04192_JONQUINET_000_014","But of course, I'm sure you've had more than enough long-winded explanations over your journeys to last a lifetime. Take this reward for your contribution, and take satisfaction in a job well done."
