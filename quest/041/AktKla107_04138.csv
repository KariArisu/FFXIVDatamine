1,"TEXT_AKTKLA107_04138_SEQ_01","Rurusha has discovered something strange inside the relic which appears to resemble an Allagan tomestone. She theorizes the device contains some heretofore forgotten knowledge, but a faulty connector may be preventing the mammet from accessing this repository of wisdom. To that end, she bids you fashion a new connector that should finally allow the Golden Dhyata to function as it was intended.

※Check Rurusha's box for more materials should you run out while attempting to craft the gold connector."
2,"TEXT_AKTKLA107_04138_SEQ_02","You deliver the gold connector to Rurusha only to learn from Boric that her very employment is under threat. Professor Namono has gathered the signatures needed to hold an inquiry into Rurusha's use of funding and the merit of her continued tenure at the Studium. Repairs on the relic are not yet complete, however, and so she sends you and Boric ahead of her to Learners' Meet while she completes her work."
3,"TEXT_AKTKLA107_04138_SEQ_03","After Boric fails spectacularly to stall for time, the scholarch commences his inquiry. However, it soon becomes clear that her continued employment can only benefit the Studium when she presents the fruits of her labor. The relic all believed to be little more than rubbish is, in truth, capable of translating ancient languages. Professor Namono apologizes for his animosity, after which Montichaigne suggests the two professors work together in their pursuit of knowledge. With the inquiry ended, Rurusha invites you back to Makers' Meet to thank you properly."
4,"TEXT_AKTKLA107_04138_SEQ_04","The two professors are prepared to join forces, and with Boric to assist them, there is no telling what groundbreaking research they may produce. Rurusha thanks you again for all you have done. When next you meet, she hopes to regale you with her myriad discoveries."
