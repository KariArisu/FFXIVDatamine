49,"TEXT_AKTKYR101_04170_GRIGGE_000_001","...But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. I am Grigge, one of Sharlayan's gleaners. It is our role to procure materials, samples, knowledge─all you can imagine, and more."

Thus did we form a guildship, the better to share information and see the requests we receive to the hands of those best suited to fulfilling them."

53,"TEXT_AKTKYR101_04170_GRIGGE_000_005","...Unofficially, however, we're up to our necks in requests as of late, and they're coming in faster than ever before. We'll take any talent we can get─and pay good coin for it─so please, tell me you're interested!"
54,"TEXT_AKTKYR101_04170_SYSTEM_000_006","You may now undertake gleaner leves by speaking with Grigge."
