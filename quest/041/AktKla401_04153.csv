The problem, as she explains it, is he has yet to decide what it is he needs assistance with. Even so, she hopes speaking with him in person will help make clear their dire circumstances. And so you set off for Noumenon for an audience with Professor Tankin."
2,"TEXT_AKTKLA401_04153_SEQ_02","You find the professor sound asleep, though he seems grateful enough when you stir him from slumber. He notes your arrival is quite timely, as he but recently decided on the subject of his research. He then asks you to accompany him back to Searchers' Meet in order to hear more about his academic efforts."
3,"TEXT_AKTKLA401_04153_SEQ_03","Professor Tankin explains that his research is focused on recreating the lifestyles of other cultures so that he can ascertain which is best suited to enrich the lives of the people in Sharlayan. You agree to aid him by gathering whatever materials he needs to carry out his work. Not wishing to waste time, Professor Tankin excuses himself to consider where to begin with his research, leaving you to speak with Hinageshi."
