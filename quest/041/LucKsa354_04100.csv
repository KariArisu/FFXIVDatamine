51,"TEXT_LUCKSA354_04100_GEROLT_000_003","If it makes me a better smith, though, I can't rightly complain. But more importantly, there's only one ingredient left that we need─crystals o' raw emotion."
52,"TEXT_LUCKSA354_04100_GEROLT_000_004","And when the weapon's finished, that just leaves takin' it over to Regana's node to add the finishin' touches."

But first, a word from our sponsors at Rowena's House of Splendors..."

59,"TEXT_LUCKSA354_04100_GEROLT_000_010","Is it me or does she seem a bit distracted o' late?"
60,"TEXT_LUCKSA354_04100_ZLATAN_000_011","Now that you mention it, she was acting rather strangely when her associates were present."

63,"TEXT_LUCKSA354_04100_GEROLT_000_014","Bah, no need to be fancy about it, they are what they are─raw emotions. If ye need anythin' else, be sure to talk with Zoltron."

66,"TEXT_LUCKSA354_04100_ZLATAN_000_030","We are on the precipice of an achievement that matches, if not surpasses, the feats performed by our forebears. All that remains is a suitable number of these raw emotions to finish refining the Resistance weapon."
67,"TEXT_LUCKSA354_04100_ZLATAN_000_031","And by the time you return, I hope to have learned more of Regana's plans. Safe travels, Blade <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>."
