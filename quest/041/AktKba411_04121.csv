1,"TEXT_AKTKBA411_04121_SEQ_01","The whereabouts of the blasphemy remain unknown. Lord Hien, meanwhile, was last said to be visiting the village of Isari, though Yugiri fears he has been away overlong. She invites you to accompany her there and see if aught is amiss."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA411_04121_SEQ_02","You find Lord Hien none the worse for wear, but as he explains it, the people of Isari have been less than hospitable. For reasons unknown, the villagers refuse to speak with him. The reason for their silence remains to be seen, but Lord Hien hopes they will be more forthcoming with information if you or Yugiri speak with them."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA411_04121_SEQ_03","You learn of a woman named Kisei and her stepdaughter, who she claims was transformed not into a blasphemy, but a great kami known as Izanami. The villagers also confess a resentment towards Lord Hien for his failure to bring Yotsuyu to justice in their eyes. Satisfied with what you have learned, you reconvene with Yugiri and Lord Hien to share your findings."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA411_04121_SEQ_04","Hien and Yugiri are incredulous at the suggestion that a woman of the village was transformed into anything but a blasphemy. Nevertheless, many people of Isari are firmly convinced. It has also been claimed that Kisei has the power to commune with the dead. Knowing she plans to demonstrate her powers at a nearby tavern, you and Yugiri go to bear witness firsthand.

To Yugiri's surprise, Kisei's display is quite compelling. After a young man finishes conversing with what all believe is his departed father, others raise their voices in desperation, begging to speak with their loved ones. Having seen enough, you return to Lord Hien to share what you observed."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA411_04121_SEQ_05","You speak with Lord Hien of the assembly in the tavern, but before you can decide on your next move, a cry is heard in the distance. You run to render aid but arrive too late─the blasphemy has come and gone, leaving another victim in its wake. Kisei joins you soon after, an entourage of her followers in tow. She reaffirms her belief that her daughter has become a kami, and that she will redress the balance between the living and the dead."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA411_04121_SEQ_06","Recent events in Isari weigh heavy on Lord Hien's mind. He invites you back to the Doman Enclave to discuss his next course of action."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA411_04121_SEQ_07","Lord Hien is convinced the blasphemy is targeting those who were returned to Doma in the prisoner exchange. He intends to call together and move them to a secure location, that his hunt for the blasphemy may be carried out without fear of further tragedy.

※The next role quest will be available from Yugiri upon reaching level 87 in any physical ranged DPS class."
