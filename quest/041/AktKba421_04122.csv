1,"TEXT_AKTKBA421_04122_SEQ_01","Yugiri suspects Kisei hails from her home of Sui-no-Sato, and after asking the Kojin to inquire in her stead, she is all but certain. To learn more would require speaking with the people of Sui-no-Sato in person, a seemingly impossible task due to her exile imposed by the Ruby Princess. To that end, she asks you to lead the investigation while she accompanies you in disguise. She will meet you at Onokoro after donning a suitable guise."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA421_04122_SEQ_02","You arrive to find Yugiri dressed in the selfsame garbs she wore when you first met in Eorzea. Before departing, she explains to you the reason for her banishment─that her people feared she might drag them into Doma's war with the Empire. Putting the past aside for now, you press onward and downward, into the deep beneath the waves of the Ruby Sea."

6,"TEXT_AKTKBA421_04122_SEQ_06","Yunagi tells you of Kisei's past, and her gifts that drew the scrutiny of the Ruby Princess. Whether she does possess preternatural powers remains to be seen, but what is certain is her claims led to her exile. Before you part ways, Yunagi takes note of your disguised companion, and bids her deliver a message to one Yugiri Mistwalker: that her mother and father love her, and could not be more proud."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA421_04122_SEQ_07","Satisfied with this newfound piece to the puzzle of Kisei's past─and still unsure how to feel about her conversation with her mother─Yugiri bids you join her at the enclave to speak with Hien."
