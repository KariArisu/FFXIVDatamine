50,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_001","You see, I've essentially completed my analysis of the currents surrounding Thavnair. I must say, it's been most enlightening."

52,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_003","We've been unable to even set foot in the region until now, which means that gathering data there could lead to a truly revolutionary discovery.

54,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_005","I do, however, have an idea how we might get around that. The answer, my friend, is shellfish! Studying the growth lines within their shells should allow me to draw some conclusions about how their habitat has changed over time."
55,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_006","After carefully perusing Professor Nele's tomes, I've come to the conclusion that Garlean clams would be particularly suitable as a research specimen. Do you think you'd be up to the task of catching some for me?"

60,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_100_008","Ah, yes. I also read that clams exist in abundance in the area around Camp Broken Glass, and that leeches are particularly effective in luring them up from the water's bottom."

64,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_011","I've heard that Garlemald continues to be a most volatile and perilous place. I admire your courage, friend─even were it not for my aether sickness, I doubt I could work up the nerve to go there myself."
65,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_020","You've done it! My colleagues will be burning with envy when they hear I've obtained a specimen from Garlemald! How can I even begin to express my gratitude?"

67,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_030","Oh, you might be wondering who this is. My research has been progressing so well of late that I've brought on a few of my students to serve as assistants and help me analyze all this data."
68,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_031","At any rate, I cannot thank you enough for braving such hostile environs for the sake of my life's work.

69,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_032","Needless to say, this puts even more pressure on me to deliver with my thesis. Oh dear, my stomach's starting to feel queasy just thinking about it."
70,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_NELE_000_033","Ah, T'laqa. Would you believe you're the talk of the Studium? Even the senior faculty can scarcely wait to hear what you are able to glean about the aether currents of Garlemald."
71,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_034","Professor! Yes, it's all thanks to <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here. Without <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> aid, I never could have procured this most invaluable specimen."
72,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_NELE_000_035","Indeed. Truly, I have not seen a partnership between scholar and gleaner bear such fruit so swiftly in a very long time."
73,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_036","Oh, that's right! Speaking of gleaning, I meant to tell you about everything I'd learned from the clams you brought."
74,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_037","I'm pleased to report that analyzing Garlean clams appears to have been the right call. Examining their growth lines, I was able to find specimens as old as ninety-seven years─giving me almost a full century of data to analyze!"
75,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_038","By far the most interesting thing I've noticed so far is the reverse correlation between the aether levels near Thavnair and those in Garlemald."
76,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_039","That is to say, over periods of time when the aether concentration was high near Thavnair, it was low in Garlemald. The reverse was also true."
77,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_NELE_000_040","I see. That bit of evidence would seem to corroborate your hypothesis that the planet's aether currents move in tandem with each other."
78,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_NELE_000_041","Should you manage to collect data from more regions still, I suspect you may very well be able to accurately predict changes in the fish population across the world. This could have remarkable implications for the future of the fishing trade."
79,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_042","I was thinking the very same, Professor! Nothing would give me greater joy than if my research were to bring about a tangible improvement in people's lives."
80,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_043","Before meeting you, I never dreamed I would make it this far. But now, I feel more confident than ever that I will be able to prove my hypothesis one day!"
81,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_TLAQATIA_000_044","Why, I can almost see my completed thesis in my mind's eye! But I can't afford to get too complacent just yet. The most important work remains to be done!"
82,"TEXT_AKTKLA504_04163_NELE_000_045","I am pleased to see that all is progressing well. And yet, do not be surprised if there comes a time when T'laqa's resolve as a researcher is tested."
