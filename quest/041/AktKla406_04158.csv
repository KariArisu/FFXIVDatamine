51,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_021","Yes, of course."
52,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_022","Our research thus far on the lifestyles of peoples in various regions has proved quite enlightening. However, after much deliberation, I have concluded that to merely compare and contrast locations alone will not suffice. No, we must consider different time periods as well."
53,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_023","Oh my. Well, I suppose that means we will be studying Allag, then? I can think of no other bygone cultures worthy of scrutiny."
54,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_024","And I understand full well why you would reach that conclusion. However, I recently happened upon records that suggest there exists a civilization that predates Allagans. A civilization older than time, far more advanced than one might believe possible."

67,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_040","I find it immensely more constructive to prove, rather than disprove, the existence of past civilizations. And with your help, I believe we can do just that."
68,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_050","You know, a part of me thinks it odd that we now strive to emulate an ancient civilization. Would that not, after all, mean we are taking a step back? Though, if this Elpis is as advanced as you say, perhaps it will prove to be a step forward."
69,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_060","Goodness me, you really did it! If I may ask, how exactly did you come by this...? Perhaps I'm better off not knowing."
70,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_061","Goodness me, this material is unlike anything I've ever seen. Honestly, I find it hard to believe it is as old as you say... All the better for our work, I suppose."

76,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_072","Oh, my apologies, Hinageshi. I was simply imagining what the people of Elpis might have sounded like."
77,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_073","Ahem. We did our best to recreate their culture based on what you have told us. Frankly, it felt like I had wandered into a faerie tale at times, but I do find their way of life has its merits. They do not waste time on the frivolous. Everything has a clear, functional purpose."
78,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_074","Perhaps, but I find their clothes make it rather difficult to go about one's duties..."
79,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_075","It is entirely possible they did not need to engage in physical labor. Their proficiency in creation magicks may have led to the decline of their physical frames. Wielding writing quills and such was no doubt a simple matter, but it is unlikely they could bear anything weighty."
80,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_076","What role do you suppose these masks played, exactly? Mayhap, they were averse to showing their faces?"
81,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_077","I would posit that they distinguished each other not by their outward appearances, but by their aether. Or, perhaps, they all led such fulfilling lives that they simply had no need to express themselves as individuals."
82,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_078","To think that such a sophisticated civilization vanished in but the blink of an eye. I wonder if all cultures are ultimately destined to meet the same fate."
83,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_079","We will discover that answer in due time, I'm sure. Though part of me wishes we could live like this forever."
84,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_080","Haha, an interesting idea, Hinageshi, but I am not so sure it is a wise one. Still, it is gladdening to see you enjoy the cultures of the old world so."
85,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_081","Oh, no. That's not what I meant. Not exactly..."
86,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_082","I was merely thinking how nice it would be if every day could be like this, experiencing new ways of living together."
87,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_083","Studying the length and breadth of a people's history as a whole, we could see naught but trends and tendencies. Like this, however, taking a glimpse of their lives, day by day, the parallels between our cultures become quite clear."
88,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_084","Even these ancients of Elpis no doubt enjoyed the simple pleasures of life as we do, taking each day as they came."
89,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_085","It would be oh-so lovely if we could do the same. Enjoying the simple pleasures of life. One day at a time."
90,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_086","Why, Hinageshi..."
91,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_TANKIN_000_087","You are exactly right! I sometimes feel I learn more from you than I do my own research."
92,"TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_088","You flatter me, Professor, but I've said nothing worthy of such praise."
