1,"TEXT_AKTKBA511_04127_SEQ_01","Having finished speaking with the rescued clergymen, Clem arrives at the strategy room to report his findings. He reaffirms that, since the church's deception was made public, he and his brethren have been the subject of harassment by certain quarters of the populace. In spite of this, he still believes that the church may again serve as a beacon of hope for the people. His unwavering faith, Aymeric believes, is the reason why he did not turn when others did. Having thus established the cause for the transformations, you turn your attention to the mystery of Profane Fafnir's identity. It is decided that you will seek out eyewitnesses among ordinary citizens, and to that end you head to the Hoplon to make inquiries."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA511_04127_SEQ_02","You converse with a number of citizens and gain some insights into the identity of the man-turned-blasphemy. Satisfied, you go to seek out Aymeric at the Arc of the Venerable."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA511_04127_SEQ_03","After sharing your findings with one another, you and your companions determine that the man may have been a patient at Saint Vaindreau's Grace, and by curious coincidence has the same name as the figure for whom the infirmary was named. Artoirel volunteers to head to the Firmament to make inquiries, and bids you and Aymeric await him in the Brume."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA511_04127_SEQ_04","Artoirel emerges from the Firmament with Loverick, the infirmary aide who had care of Vaindreau. From him you learn that the young man was found by a patrol in the central highlands. After being treated for his injuries, he was brought to the infirmary for recovery, during which time he was heard muttering the names of Archbishop Thordan and Bishop Vartinoix while unconscious. By this, Loverick assumed that Vaindreau was a pious man who regarded them with respect and reverence, but you cannot help but wonder whether there is more to it.

※In the event that you leave the strategy room, you may re-enter by speaking with the Temple Knight guard at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA511_04127_SEQ_05","Back at the Congregation, you consider why Vaindreau would speak Bishop Vartinoix's name specifically. In light of the possibility that they were personally acquainted, Artoirel proposes speaking with His Grace directly, and Aymeric leaves to arrange a meeting.

※The next role quest will be available from Artoirel upon reaching level 87 in any magical ranged DPS class."
