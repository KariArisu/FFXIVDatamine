1,"TEXT_AKTKBA311_04115_SEQ_01","While Limsa Lominsa's Sahagin allies assist in the hunt for the blasphemy, Merlwyb wishes to attempt negotiations with the Crushing Tide, in hopes of easing tensions and forestalling any additional transformations. To that end, a parley has been arranged with Doww─leader of the hostile faction─at the Sapsa Spawning Grounds, whereto you will accompany the Admiral."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA311_04115_SEQ_02","You join Merlwyb near the spawning grounds, but Doww is nowhere to be found. With some trepidation, the two of you decide to seek answers from the other members of Crushing Tide in the vicinity.

※You must be accompanied by Merlwyb to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA311_04115_SEQ_03","Together with the Admiral, you speak to a few of the hostile Sahagin, one of whom grudgingly reveals Speaker Doww's current whereabouts to you. Resolving to take caution not to fan the flames, you go to seek him out."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA311_04115_SEQ_04","You succeed in tracking down Doww, who receives the Admiral's words with as much disdain as was to be expected. Nevertheless, he acquiesces to a parley in South Tidegate, if only as a show of strength for his followers. You can only hope that the Crushing Tide's leader will be more receptive when next you speak."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA311_04115_SEQ_05","Back at South Tidegate, your parley with Speaker Doww proves an unmitigated disaster when he dismisses the Admiral's offer out of hand, and his followers─overcome by their anger and despair─transform into beasts before your eyes. Lofty aspirations of peace will have to wait until you have dealt with the immediate threat."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA311_04115_SEQ_06","You swiftly dispatch the beast before it can sow untold chaos. Your concern turns to Noll, who you hope has survived the battle unscathed."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA311_04115_SEQ_07","Noll is visibly shaken by the horrors he has just witnessed, but otherwise no worse for the wear. He encourages you to check on the Admiral, who was fighting off a beast of her own."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBA311_04115_SEQ_08","The immediate threat having been dealt with, you reconvene with your companions. Noll is deeply disturbed─not merely by the sight of his brothers transforming before his eyes, but by Speaker Doww's fanatical delusion that it is a blessing bestowed upon them by Leviathan himself. Fearing disaster should greater numbers of the Crushing Tide turn, Merlwyb resolves to redouble her efforts in dispatching the blasphemy with all speed, and bids you join her back at Maelstrom Command."
9,"TEXT_AKTKBA311_04115_SEQ_09","Back in Limsa, Merlwyb expresses concern that reinforcements may be needed in dealing with the twofold threat of the blasphemy and the Crushing Tide. She bids you remain close by until such time as further action can be taken.

※The next role quest will be available from the Maelstrom secretariat upon reaching level 87 in any melee DPS class."
