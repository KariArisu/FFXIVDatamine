Rather than attempt to explain the taste, she bids you join her at Makers' Meet and try the newly created comestible yourself."

By way of apology, the self-proclaimed student of nutrition offers to serve you a palate cleanser at the Last Stand while she more fully explains the severity of the situation at hand."

Debroye is greatly concerned by the idea that the awful bread may be adopted not only as an emergency recipe, but also as a staple of the Sharlayan diet. She pleads with you to return with her to Makers' Meet, and aid her efforts in improving the taste of this “perfect meal.”"
