1,"TEXT_AKTKBA131_04105_SEQ_01","The Keeper of the Entwined Serpents is barely able to contain his excitement as he informs you that Kan–E–Senna has grown strong enough to receive visitors. He rushes off to Stillglade Fane and bids you follow."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA131_04105_SEQ_02","The Elder Seedseer is eager to resume her duties, but E–Sumi–Yan insists that she remain in convalescence for her own benefit. Nevertheless, she is resolved to help however she can, and joins you in discussing your next course of action. She suggests that identifying the man Gleipnir was before its transformation might help you gain insight into its behavior, prompting you to share the vision granted to you by the Echo. Kan–E–Senna then reveals that the young Padjal you saw was Ea–Sura–Supin, childhood friend and fellow student, who was stripped of his horns after being deceived. Though he was cast out for his mistake and seemingly vanished, E–Sumi–Yan tells you that the boy sought the counsel of the moogles, hoping to find a way to regain the elementals' favor. Fortunately, the reclusive beings can be easily found in the Bramble Patch."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA131_04105_SEQ_03","In the Bramble Patch you encounter a pair of moogles who quickly recognize you as the hero that laid low Good King Moggle Mog XII─may the memory of his magnificence never be forgot. One of the pair, Pukwa Pika, further explains that the moogles are hard at work cleansing the corruption that has spread throughout the woods. Asking for your help, she rises high into the air so as to survey the surrounding land. Although no obvious pathway up is available to you, it is plain the moogle means for you to follow her."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA131_04105_SEQ_04","You and Pukwa Pika survey the forest, and the perceptive moogle spots an area of tainted earth to the south. In order to offer what comfort you can to the forest, you must go and cleanse the corrupted aether."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA131_04105_SEQ_05","With a delicate touch and soft words, you purge the corruption from the soil. Pukwa Pika will doubtless be pleased to hear that the deed is done."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA131_04105_SEQ_06","Pukwa Pika is amazed by your ability to purge corruption from the earth and is eager to check up on the progress of the other moogles. Her enthusiasm is dampened, however, when she learns that the corruption is spreading faster than the moogles can cleanse it. As an alternative approach, Kupdi Koop suggests following in the footsteps of Jorin, sire of the first Padjal, who planted saplings throughout the Twelveswood in a show of fellowship with the elementals. All present agree this is a fine idea, and the moogles head off into the Twelveswood to gather what saplings they can. The Elder Seedseer's attendant at the Adders' Nest will want to know of this new development."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA131_04105_SEQ_07","The Keeper of the Entwined Serpents thinks the moogles' plan a fitting one. There is not much to do while they gather saplings, however, so he asks you to get some well-earned rest.

※The next role quest will be available from the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents upon reaching level 89 in any tank class."
