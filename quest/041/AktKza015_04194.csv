51,"TEXT_AKTKZA015_04194_EMANIETTE_000_003","I require three samples of brown mud from Troglophile's Deep. They should be easy to spot, but reaching them unscathed may be another matter entirely."

54,"TEXT_AKTKZA015_04194_EMANIETTE_000_012","I recently acquired texts from their homeland that go into some detail about their agriculture. Did you know they mix bat droppings into the soil to make it more fertile? Quite ingenious."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZA015_04194_EMANIETTE_000_013","The land they live in is quite temperate, and it is writ that after one hundred summers the droppings solidify into something resembling stone, further concentrating the nutrients contained within."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZA015_04194_EMANIETTE_000_014","Of course, the samples you've provided me today are far too ripe to be of much use on their own. However, what is the purpose of research if not to free us from the bounds of the natural world?"

Regardless, I aim to speed up the ripening process, creating in days what takes nature centuries to accomplish. If I succeed, farmers across the realm will rejoice, and they will have you to thank for it!"
