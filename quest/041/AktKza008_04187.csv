48,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_000","You look strong, sturdy, and─most importantly─idle. Which is a wonderful coincidence, as I'm in need of a spare pair of hands. Let me explain."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_001","I sent one of my younger colleagues off to the Aesthete's Tholos to organize a shipment of ore...but after a second glance at the order sheet, I realized why it was taking him so blasted long."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_002","Seems the order was more than triple the size we usually handle─something to do with all these large-scale preparations, I suppose. And I can hardly expect that pup to shift it all on his lonesome."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_003","Come and pitch in with the hauling, and I'll make it worth your while. What say you?"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_004","Good. Many hands make light work─well, lighter, at least. Let's go."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_NEWRESEARCHER04187_000_010","Please tell me you're the help I was promised..."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_NEWRESEARCHER04187_000_011","Oh, thank the stars! My supervisor came past not a moment ago and scooped up half the ore himself. I swear he's part forest troll... But even so, I don't think I can manage the rest without doing myself an injury."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_NEWRESEARCHER04187_000_012","Listen, if I take this crate, do you think you could carry that other load? Once you have it settled into a comfortable grip, I'll lead us to where we need to go."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_NEWRESEARCHER04187_000_013","Yes, that big box there full of ore. And don't ask me about carts─I put in a request <Emphasis>weeks</Emphasis> ago."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_SYSTEM_000_020","Commence hauling?"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_SYSTEM_000_021","Follow the lightly built lab assistant and try not to fall behind."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_SYSTEM_100_021","You will have three minutes to complete the task. Should you fail, return to the starting location and begin anew."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_NEWRESEARCHER04187_000_022","I see you're no stranger to hauling heavy things about! Come on─let's get moving before my arms fall off!"
61,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_NEWRESEARCHER04187_000_024","Yes, um, I'll need you to actually bring the crate. You know, <Emphasis>physically</Emphasis>."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_025","Where's the rest of the ore? Did you leave it back in the Outer Circuit?"

64,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_030","That ought to do it. Come on back to the Archeion, and I'll pay you what you're owed."
65,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_NEWRESEARCHER04187_000_031","Thanks, I can handle the rest from here─the worst of it is over!"

67,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_040","I'm glad you came along when you did. I can't be hauling ore all day, and my colleague is not exactly built for hard labor."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_041","The Aesthete's Tholos is where we store our mineral deposits, you see, and it <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> our job to field and fill requests from our fellow researchers..."
69,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_042","But we're not equipped to process orders of that quantity, especially if the Central Circuit keeps sending up requisition papers at the same frenzied pace."
70,"TEXT_AKTKZA008_04187_GOODSHAPERESEARCHER04187_000_043","We'll run out of stock before long─assuming our backs don't give out first. Anyway, you're not here to listen to me gripe. Take your wages, and good work!"
