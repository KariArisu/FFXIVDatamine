1,"TEXT_AKTKBA501_04126_SEQ_01","The Ishgardian delegate informs you that a dread blasphemy resembling a dragon has appeared in Ishgard, spreading panic throughout the nation. Seeking to vanquish the threat without delay, the authorities have begun assembling a hunting party. Though they have no shortage of valorous knights, the Ishgardians believe that their mission would benefit for the presence of a battle mage who can stand unflinching in the face of their fell quarry─and who should fit that description better than you? Having agreed to lend your strength, you promptly depart for the Holy See."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA501_04126_SEQ_02","Arriving in snow-swept Ishgard, you are warmly welcomed by both Artoirel and Aymeric, who brief you on the situation with the blasphemy. Dubbed Profane Fafnir, the beast was apparently born from a young man seen stumbling through the Hoplon in a state of distress. Though the creature soon fled, it has since been seen in the skies above Ishgard on a regular basis, and the mere sight of it has caused others to turn as well. While the identity of the first victim is unknown, it has been determined that all who were subsequently transformed were people of fervent faith, such as priests and inquisitors. In order to better understand the situation, Artoirel has arranged a meeting with the sole member of the clergy who witnessed the blasphemy's birth but did not turn. Thus do you make your way to Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral, where the man, a deacon named Clem, awaits."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA501_04126_SEQ_03","You speak with Clem, who recounts the terrifying moment the blasphemy appeared, and confirms that his brethren who were present were all overcome with despair and transformed. As the deacon recounts his tale, Bishop Vartinoix, presently the highest authority in the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, appears and thanks you for your efforts to rid Ishgard of this scourge. After he has taken his leave, Clem turns to you with a request─a request which his tone suggests may be somewhat urgent..."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA501_04126_SEQ_04","In the wake of the transformations, a group of clergymen fled the city in fear. Believing that it is more dangerous out in the wilderness, Clem entreats your aid in searching for them in the western highlands, that they may be persuaded to return to Ishgard. While Artoirel and Aymeric tend to Hemlock, you are tasked with escorting the deacon to Gorgagne Mills."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA501_04126_SEQ_05","You succeed in finding the clergymen at Gorgagne Mills. However, in the course of lamenting their poor treatment at the hands of the populace in the wake of the war's end, an inquisitor succumbs to his despair and transforms into a beast. To prevent it from harming others, Aymeric bids you go after the creature and do what must be done."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA501_04126_SEQ_06","You find the turned inquisitor and lay him to rest. Your task accomplished, you hurry back to rejoin your companions at Gorgagne Mills."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA501_04126_SEQ_07","Aymeric informs you that the remaining clergymen have agreed to return to the Holy See. Once they have been safely escorted back, he bids everyone reconvene at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly to lay plans. For your purposes, you have the use of the strategy room, which you may enter by speaking with the Temple Knight guard stationed without."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBA501_04126_SEQ_08","Arriving at the Congregation, you announce yourself to the guard, who shows you through to join your companions.

9,"TEXT_AKTKBA501_04126_SEQ_09","Recent revelations strongly suggest that people of faith are most susceptible to turning due to the challenges they have faced since Ishgard's false history was brought to light. However, further investigation will be required if you are to draw a definite conclusion, and Aymeric bids you take a moment's rest while he and Artoirel make provisions for your next move.

※The next role quest will be available from Artoirel upon reaching level 86 in any magical ranged DPS class."
