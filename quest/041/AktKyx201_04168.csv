1,"TEXT_AKTKYX201_04168_SEQ_01","Relieved to see a peerless adventurer such as yourself, Jammingway explains that the reconnaissance automaton they dispatched to Ultima Thule has recently sent a most troubling distress signal. He bids you join him at Thaumazein that, together, you might investigate the matter further."
2,"TEXT_AKTKYX201_04168_SEQ_02","Your Loporrit companion explains that─for reasons somewhat difficult to wrap the mind around─the <Emphasis>Ragnarok</Emphasis> is capable of transporting you to Ultima Thule even without your fueling the aetherburner. A parting gift from Venat, mayhap, or Meteion."

4,"TEXT_AKTKYX201_04168_SEQ_04","At Base Omicron, you meet the military information and operations Omicron N-7000. It relays a troubling series of events that have led to the reawakening of Stigma-4, a militaristic matrix that now threatens to annihilate your planet. As destroying Stigma-4 would have catastrophic consequences for the Omicrons of Ultima Thule, you settle on an alternate solution─adding the distinct impression of defeat to the war cache in Stigma-4's memory banks so that the matrix might reconsider its optimal course of action."
5,"TEXT_AKTKYX201_04168_SEQ_05","N-7000 has opened an access pathway to Stigma-4's memory systems in the form of a virtual environment. Enter the matrix's subconscious and do what you must to defy its aggressive protocols.

7,"TEXT_AKTKYX201_04168_SEQ_07","Convinced that its attempt at conquest would end in failure, Stigma-4 ceases its military campaign and is put to work on diplomatic holograms instead. N-7000, however, finds itself without purpose now that peace is here to stay. To prevent it entering eternal sleep mode, Jammingway proposes opening a café as a way to find meaning in life and help others do the same."
8,"TEXT_AKTKYX201_04168_SEQ_08","You visit the nekropolis, where an old venue stands ready to become the new café. Here, as Jammingway tells it, they and N-7000 will endeavor to pass on the knowledge of lost civilizations, and inspire hope in those that have fallen to despair. What future awaits them and the countless travelers that will doubtless visit in the years to come?"
