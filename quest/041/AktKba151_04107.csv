1,"TEXT_AKTKBA151_04107_SEQ_01","At the Adders' Nest, Kan–E–Senna explains that the ceremony she will soon carry out will be to summon the Irmin Hedge─a powerful barrier which greatly mitigated the damage inflicted upon the Twelveswood during the Calamity. On this occasion, however, it will be employed to purify the corruption that plagues the Twelveswood. The branches of the great one have been delivered across the Twelveswood, and the final one is to be placed in Gridania itself. Kan–E asks you to do the honors, and bids you follow her to the Leatherworkers' Guild, where the ancient tree that will receive the branch resides."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA151_04107_SEQ_02","Branch in hand, you climb the massive tree until you find the spot of weathered bark the Elder Seedseer pointed out to you earlier. You affix the branch, completing the final connection and empowering the great one to extend its essence all throughout the forest with ease. The time has come to proceed to Everschade and carry out the ritual, that together you may bring a close to this dark chapter of Gridania's history."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA151_04107_SEQ_03","Under the mighty boughs of the Guardian Tree, the Elder Seedseer makes ready to begin a ceremony which has not been seen since Dalamud fell. As if to stop her, Gleipnir emerges snarling from the woods, and Kan–E–Senna beseeches you for your protection. The blasphemy charges, and only you stand between its fury and Gridania's demise."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA151_04107_SEQ_04","The battle is hard-fought, but you hold Gleipnir at bay long enough for Kan–E–Senna to summon the Irmin Hedge, rendering the beast's poison ineffective. Together you, the Elder Seedseer, and her Keeper bring an end to the blasphemy, and with it the tragic tale of Ea–Sura–Supin. The sacred wood that once held its breath in fear breathes a long sigh of relief. Though exhausted from events, the Elder Seedseer wears an expression of satisfaction and accomplishment."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA151_04107_SEQ_05","With Gleipnir slain, the effects of its poison are much diminished. But there is no rest for the righteous, and Kan–E–Senna must journey home to Gridania and the many duties that await her. She asks that you visit her at the Lotus Stand upon your own return to the city."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA151_04107_SEQ_06","As hoped, those weakened by Gleipnir's poison have already begun to heal, and once more Kan–E thanks you on behalf of her nation. She vows to remember Ea–Sura not as the blasphemy he became, but as the young boy who taught her that the elementals' blessing was not a burden, but a gift to be shared. And so, hand in hand with the elementals and her people, she will walk along a path into the future that they will discover together. But what of her faithful Keeper of the Entwined Serpents, who has been a constant presence at her side?"
7,"TEXT_AKTKBA151_04107_SEQ_07","The Keeper of the Entwined Serpents is no less resolved than the Elder Seedseer to continue to serve Gridania. As his duties require that he remain at home, he bids you journey to Radz–at–Han to inform the officer there that there is one less blasphemy in the world."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBA151_04107_SEQ_08","The Gridanian delegate is joyed to hear of Gleipnir's demise─and more than a little relieved, given that you did not return quite as quickly as he had anticipated. He thanks you on behalf of his nation, and bids you farewell...at least, that is, until the next time the Twelveswood and her people are faced with a crisis once more."
