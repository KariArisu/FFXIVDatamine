49,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_002","To review, I require samples of aquatic life from various bodies of water, that I might analyze them and ascertain the current state of the respective regions' underwater aether currents."
50,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_003","Before I send you off to far-flung locales, I'd like to gather data from somewhere nearby. Collecting samples from a stable, controlled environment like Labyrinthos should give me a good basis with which to compare any future findings."
51,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_004","To that end, I'd like to ask you to catch me some giant aetherlice─and a fair share of them, to ensure a representative sample size. According to my preliminary research, they swim in abundance near the Phreatic Conduit, and have a noted fondness for gold salmon roe."
52,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_SYSTEM_000_005","You may now undertake deliveries for the Faculty of Aetherology at the Studium. By delivering the requested items to T'laqa Tia and raising yourself in his esteem, you can help him to finally complete his thesis."
53,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_006","Have you had any luck catching those lice? If not, I suggest heading to the Phreatic Conduit with some gold salmon roe in your tackle box. That is what you fishers call it, yes?"
54,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_010","You've brought the aetherlice I requested? Splendid! I must analyze these at once and record my findings."
55,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_011","Now <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> is a remarkable catch! Impressive specimens like these will give me even more quality data. I can't thank you enough!"
56,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_SYSTEM_000_012","In making your first successful delivery, you have begun to earn T'laqa Tia's trust."
57,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_SYSTEM_000_013","Deliver the items T'laqa Tia needs, and deliver them often to improve your standing with the Faculty of Aetherology!"
58,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_020","Thanks to your efforts, I've been able to compile a full set of reference data. Now, we can finally get started on spots further afield."
59,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_021","But before that, I haven't yet explained my research to you in detail, have I? Simply put, there's a certain hypothesis I want to prove."
60,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_022","In my studies over the years, I have come to believe that much like the tide ebbs and flows with the phases of the moon, so, too, do the underwater aether currents that cover our entire planet."
61,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_023","When the concentration of aether in any given current changes, aquatic life in the area grows more or less abundant, which ultimately affects the currents of the ocean itself."
62,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_024","My hope is that─if I can prove this and accurately predict these changes─we might theoretically identify the best times for fishing, and even know when it's safest to navigate the seas."
63,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_025","Needless to say, it would be a major breakthrough! And I'm one step closer to realizing it all, thanks to you."

69,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_NELE_000_031","Your mind for developing compelling hypotheses has always impressed me. You lacked only for a skilled gleaner to help you overcome the limits of your affliction. I will be watching this new partnership of yours with great interest."
70,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_032","Phew! Why, that actually wasn't so bad. Just having you around has already taken a huge weight off my shoulders."
71,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_033","Up until now, Professor Nele's confidence in me only made me feel pressured to deliver something that I wasn't even sure I was capable of."
72,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_034","But now I've finally started to make some tangible progress, and it's all because of you. For the first time, I feel like I may have a bright future in academia after all!"
73,"TEXT_AKTKLA502_04161_TLAQATIA_000_035","Yes, I have a feeling everything is going to go swimmingly─no pun intended─as long as you're by my side!"
