Believing that those who had previously sought refuge in Ul'dah are also in danger, Raubahn invites you and Arenvald to join him for a meeting with Nanamo, that you may ease the woes of these displaced peoples."

Since there is a strong possibility that Nanamo wanders incognito to learn more from Ul'dah's most impoverished civilians, you select the notorious Pearl Lane as your next destination.

7,"TEXT_AKTKBA221_04110_SEQ_07","Raubahn and Arenvald share with Nanamo the latest tidings from Ala Mhigo and express their concern for the refugees who have migrated to Ul'dah over the years. The sultana reaffirms her commitment to treating all Ala Mhigans who reside in her city equally, regardless of their background. While this will go some way to easing their troubles, Arenvald suggests further measures, namely a memorial ceremony dedicated to all who died during the occupation and war for independence─including Ala Mhigans who sided with Garlemald. As the guests would presumably include staunch loyalists and relatives of collaborators, Raubahn expresses concerns that such an event may invite disaster. He does, however, concede that only by confronting these issues can they begin to move forward as one people, and he thus offers Arenvald his full support."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBA221_04110_SEQ_08","Leaving Arenvald to discuss various matters with Nanamo, you return to the Ala Mhigan quarter with Raubahn. He has high hopes for Arenvald and the proposed memorial ceremony, though the commander's own efforts will be dedicated solely to the immediate threat posed by the blasphemies.

※The next role quest will be available from the blasphemy hunter upon reaching level 88 in any healer class."
