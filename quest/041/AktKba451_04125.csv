1,"TEXT_AKTKBA451_04125_SEQ_01","Preparations for the funeral are complete. The blasphemy continues to remain out of sight, and so Hien wishes to seize this opportunity to carry out the ceremony. Gosetsu, unfortunately, will be unable to attend, but Hien hopes you will accompany him and Yugiri as they make their way to the Swallow's Compass."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA451_04125_SEQ_02","While waiting for villagers to arrive, Hien is approached by Kisei, who comes not to argue but to apologize─or so it would seem. Hoping to catch him off guard, Kisei unsheathes a dagger and makes to strike, only to be cut down by Yugiri. But the seemingly foolish endeavor is in service to a greater plan, as Kisei's death draws the blasphemy from hiding, intent upon avenging its stepmother. A fierce battle ensues, and as the situation turns dire, Gosetsu joins the fray not with sword in hand but with a cane, wielding healing magicks of surprising potency. With his aid, the blasphemy is at last laid low, and the funeral can be held without fear of further disruption."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA451_04125_SEQ_03","The villagers of Doma are at last gathered, and Hien conducts a heartfelt service in remembrance of those poor souls who were never returned to Doma. One by one he recites the names and stories of parents, siblings, and children, until he finally speaks of Minato and Kisei─not of their tragic end, but of the happiness and fulfillment they found in family. The ceremony ends with a moment of silence, all present bowing their heads in prayer for their loved ones."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA451_04125_SEQ_04","With the blasphemy slain and the funeral complete, there is naught left to do but return home. And so, Hien, Yugiri, and Gosetsu are off to the Doman Enclave."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA451_04125_SEQ_05","Though it may be years, if not decades, until the people of Doma truly make peace with their past, Hien believes they have turned a corner. Yugiri praises Gosetsu's skill with healing magicks, prompting him to stress that he is still but a novice. It is for that reason that, unfortunately, he must once more leave on pilgrimage to hone his skills─though he reassures a disappointed Hien that he will fly to his side should the need arise. And so the former samurai takes his leave, prompting you to make ready to return to your other affairs as well. Hien thanks you once more for your aid, and bids you relay word of the blasphemy's demise to their representative at Radz-at-Han."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA451_04125_SEQ_06","The Doman delegate is overjoyed to learn that the blasphemy is no more, and that the state of affairs in Doma is much improved for your involvement. If Hien should have need of your marksmanship again, he is certain to seek you out before all others."
