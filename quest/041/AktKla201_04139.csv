1,"TEXT_AKTKLA201_04139_SEQ_01","You speak with Jude, the sole member of the Classical Astronomer's Association, and learn he is distraught over a broken telescope. Shortly after divulging his ails to you, he tells you of his plans to build a new one. You agree to assist him, and he hastily rushes off to Noumenon with renewed enthusiasm, hoping to rectify the situation."
2,"TEXT_AKTKLA201_04139_SEQ_02","You speak with Jude who requests you to search for tomes detailing the manufacturing process of telescopes. With any luck, you will find documents suitable to both his needs and budget."
3,"TEXT_AKTKLA201_04139_SEQ_03","A thorough search of the shelves has yielded three rather promising tomes. It remains to be seen if their contents meet with Jude's approval, however."
4,"TEXT_AKTKLA201_04139_SEQ_04","Skimming through the books you provided, Jude eventually settles upon the starlens. Though still incredulous as to its efficacy, he cannot deny its affordability. With the matter decided, he bids you return with him to his workshop."
5,"TEXT_AKTKLA201_04139_SEQ_05","Jude explains to you his reasons for joining the Faculty of Astronomy. While faint of heart, he is unwilling to compromise on his dreams of finding the Azure Star he once saw with his childhood friend. With your crafting expertise and the starlens, perhaps there is a chance he will fulfill his heart's deepest desire."
