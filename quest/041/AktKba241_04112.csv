1,"TEXT_AKTKBA241_04112_SEQ_01","The blasphemy hunter reports that Fordola has given her keepers the slip and disappeared during a training exercise. Apparently, she has been acting out of sorts ever since meeting the mother and daughter you had previously encountered in Ala Gannha, so Raubahn has gone there in search of clues as to her whereabouts."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA241_04112_SEQ_02","From speaking with the mother and child, you learn that Fordola was overwhelmed by a vision granted to her by the Echo during their meeting. It appears she witnessed the young girl's memories of a man she met moments before he transformed into the blasphemy you seek. Fordola was heard to utter the name “Charlet,” and though it is unfamiliar to your present company, Raganfrid may have useful information to share."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA241_04112_SEQ_03","Raganfrid explains that Charlet is an Ala Mhigan with ties to the Empire, and his older brother Ansfrid served under Fordola in the Crania Lupi. Fortunately, Raganfrid happens to know their uncle, who he recently helped find work at the Sleeping Stones, and he should be able to assist you in your inquiries."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA241_04112_SEQ_04","Charlet's uncle relates to you the tale of his two nephews, both of whom were raised as imperial citizens. They were also childhood friends of Fordola's, and while Ansfrid joined the army, Charlet's compassionate demeanor made him unsuited to a life in the military. After learning of the deaths of his brother and the other Skulls, he blamed himself for abandoning his friends and eventually disappeared. As the pieces of the puzzle come together, you ponder the bigger picture as you make your way back to Ala Gannha."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA241_04112_SEQ_05","You share your findings with Arenvald, in particular the link between Charlet and Fordola. It occurs to Arenvald that she is likely attempting to put down the blasphemy that her friend has become out of the belief that she is responsible for its creation."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA241_04112_SEQ_06","Back in the Ala Mhigan Quarter, Raubahn details his two-pronged approach to tracking down Charlet and Fordola. It stands to reason that if one is found, the other will not be far behind, and you decide it best to bide your time until fresh information comes to light.

※The next role quest will be available from the blasphemy hunter upon reaching level 90 in any healer class."
