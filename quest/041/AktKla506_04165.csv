67,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_TLAQATIA_100_030","Incidentally, I recently overheard some of the senior members of the faculty discussing the days before the world was sundered. This led to me wondering just how far back you traveled."
68,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_TLAQATIA_200_030","I have long heard rumors of a collective of goblin scientists who were attempting to traverse the fabric of time itself. To be honest, I always thought it a mere jest. But is it possible you used such a method to journey into the past yourself...?"

70,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_TLAQATIA_000_031","At any rate, examining the relative states of the smaragdos' scales, it appears quite evident that the levels of aether in the underwater currents fluctuated regularly even in those pre-Zodiark days."
71,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_TLAQATIA_000_032","That said, the shifts in concentration appear much gentler compared to the present day. I suspect that the inflated aether levels of the moon caused by the presence of Zodiark are the key to explaining this change."
72,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_TLAQATIA_000_033","Put simply, these recent incidents have a manifestation of aether levels returning to how they once were so very long ago."

77,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_NELE_200_036","...Truth be told, the senior faculty of the Studium have been aware of this form of travel for some time now. Sadly, as much as I argued your case, I was strictly forbidden from granting you access to it."

80,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_TLAQATIA_000_037","And yet, at the same time, I find myself with a dilemma. Is it not selfish of me to focus entirely on my own research at a time like this? Is it not my duty as a scholar to help in a more concrete manner?"
81,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_NELE_000_038","Very astute questions, those. And questions for which you must find your own answer."
82,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_NELE_000_039","Of course, none would object if you were to publish your findings. You've done more than enough to support up-and-coming researchers at the Studium, and your work will doubtless prove a fine starting point for any who wish to explore the subject further."
83,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_NELE_000_040","There are plenty of academics who are driven wholly by their own curiosity. Who devote their entire lives to their studies, and research for its own sake."
84,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_NELE_000_041","However, there is also demand for another type of researcher: one who uses their findings to seek out tangible solutions to the problems of our world."
85,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_NELE_000_042","Your research has brought you face-to-face with innocent creatures in peril, and united you with a brave companion who has traveled to the edge of the world─and beyond─for you. It is little surprise that you might find new motivation from their presence."
86,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_NELE_000_043","Yet at the end of the day, it is your choice to make. You must decide what inspires you most as a scholar. That is all I can say."
87,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_TLAQATIA_000_044","As always, Professor Nele has given me much to ponder. Up until now, I'd simply enjoyed solving the mysteries of the world through my research. Only now have I begun to realize there may be more to it than that."
88,"TEXT_AKTKLA506_04165_TLAQATIA_000_045","Forgive me, but I would like to consider the matter further. Might I be able to count on your aid again once my mind is made up?"
