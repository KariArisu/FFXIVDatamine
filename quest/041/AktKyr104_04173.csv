55,"TEXT_AKTKYR104_04173_STARWARRIORB04171_000_023","You'll find no distractions there─just you and a wooden dummy. Imagine that a fearsome foe stands before you, and strike it with all your might. The design of the dummy itself originates from the Far East, as does the practice of bashing it repeatedly to attain martial mastery.
It is said that, “<If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> who fights with strength of stone unyielding, breathes deep of boundless sky and embraces serenity of rolling sea, against <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> none can stand.”"
