50,"TEXT_AKTKYR201_04176_LITTLEGLEANER04176_000_003","Wait─you <Emphasis>have</Emphasis> heard of guildship hunts, yes? They are not so different from the hunts you're familiar with in Eorzea, as I understand it. I'd wager they're rather more challenging, but an adventurer of your caliber would never turn down a challenge, would you?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKYR201_04176_LITTLEGLEANER04176_000_004","No, no you would not! Pray speak with Northota at the peristyle to register your interest at your earliest convenience."

54,"TEXT_AKTKYR201_04176_NORTHOTA_000_012","The gleaners' guildship has begun posting hunt bills, you see, in the hopes that capable individuals will take up arms to lighten our ever-increasing load..."
55,"TEXT_AKTKYR201_04176_NORTHOTA_000_013","Unfortunately, “capable individuals” remain the sticking point. Few hailing from our fair polis are willing to take up arms─let alone able to stand against the more fearsome specimens."
56,"TEXT_AKTKYR201_04176_NORTHOTA_000_014","You, however, have the experience and the grit that we need. When I heard that you had arrived on our shores, it was music to my ears!"
57,"TEXT_AKTKYR201_04176_NORTHOTA_000_015","You needn't work for free, of course─we've done our research, and the rewards we offer are as fine as any you'll find abroad. The currency we employ is a relic of times when “gleaner” was a great deal less figurative, so you may find it somewhat...eccentric, but it's as good as gil here!"
58,"TEXT_AKTKYR201_04176_NORTHOTA_000_016","...Speaking of eccentric, it should be noted that the majority of our clients are scholars. You probably won't have heard of half the creatures they send you after, but I find it's best not to worry about that overmuch."
