1,"TEXT_AKTKBA341_04118_SEQ_01","You arrive at Maelstrom Command only to be greeted by a linkpearl call from Wheiskaet. The Company's first mate would have you join him in Costa del Sol to discuss a possible new development in your mission to take down the blasphemy. The secretariat states that she will inform the Admiral of your absence, and so you depart for eastern La Noscea."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBA341_04118_SEQ_02","At Costa del Sol, Wheiskaet explains that while he and his companions are at a loss as to how to effectively counter the blasphemy's devastating attack, he knows of someone who might fare better: a former member of the Company known for his keen eye in assessing the enemy. Sharing with you the signal used in days past to summon the man, Wheiskaet sends you to Bloodshore in the hopes that his erstwhile companion will show."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBA341_04118_SEQ_03","Lorens, the former Company sharpshooter spoken so highly of by Wheiskaet, reveals himself in response to your whistling. Very much a lone wolf, he nevertheless agrees to join your cause out of curiosity and concern for his old friends. You get the impression that he has a somewhat complex relationship with Merlwyb as well, and he invites you to join him near Hidden Falls so that he might elaborate."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBA341_04118_SEQ_04","As you look out over the sea together, Lorens shares with you a tragic episode from his and Merlwyb's past: the tale of how she was forced to kill her own father, the famed pirate captain Bloefhis. In fighting to save his daughter and her companions from Leviathan's wrath, the captain and a good number of his crew were tempered by the primal. The nature of their condition did not become apparent until they vanished, only to reappear as the Serpent Reavers a while later, a band of pirates wholly devoted to the Lord of the Whorl. Merlwyb subsequently tracked her father to an isle where she found him, a broken shell of the man he once was, and defeated him in a duel to the death as Lorens stood witness.

The reckless and aggressive manner in which Merlwyb threw herself against her father's minions left an enduring impression on Lorens, who vowed to henceforth support her from a distance as he had in the chaos of that day. With a promise to assist you in a similar fashion when it comes time to confront the blasphemy, he takes his leave and returns to the shadows."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBA341_04118_SEQ_05","Wheiskaet is heartened by the news that Lorens will be joining you, believing him the trump card you and the Company of Heroes need to turn the tide of battle when next you face your formidable foe. Confident that you have taken great strides towards achieving success in your mission, you set out to return to Limsa and report the good news."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBA341_04118_SEQ_06","Back at Maelstrom Command, the secretariat is pleased to hear that Lorens─whose name she seems to vaguely recall─will be joining the fight against the blasphemy. Thanking you for your efforts, she encourages you to rest up until the beast is found. The hour of your final confrontation is nigh.

※The next role quest will be available from the Maelstrom secretariat upon reaching level 90 in any melee DPS class."
