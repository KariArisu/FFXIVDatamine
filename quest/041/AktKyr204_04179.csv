You truly <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> one of a kind!"
49,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_NORTHOTA_000_002","Some would call you “brave,” some “reckless”...but <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> guess is that you simply do what needs to be done."
50,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_NORTHOTA_000_003","In any case, we certainly have a few hunts that call for cavalier heroics, and you're welcome to them. Frankly, I can't believe I didn't think to offer them to you sooner."
51,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_NORTHOTA_000_004","You'll recognize the term “elite marks,” I'm sure. As ever, ours tend toward the bizarre...but don't take my word for it. Ask J'lakshai."
52,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_NORTHOTA_000_005","J'lakshai will fill you in on the rest─won't you, J'lakshai? I know you're listening..."
53,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_JLAKSHAI_000_010","This has become quite the pattern, eh? One would almost think Northota prefers to leave all of the explaining to me...a conversation for another time, perhaps. You want to know more about the elite marks, yes?"
54,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_CHRYSIELLE_000_011","(-???-)You! You are the gleaner extraordinaire who made their way to the very summit of the heavens, are you not!? "
55,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_JLAKSHAI_100_011","M-My word, all of our most tiresom─er, that is to say, look how many of our esteemed clients have gathered here at once!"
56,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_CHRYSIELLE_110_011","Yes, and what of it? Considering the importance of my work and the snail's pace at which you are fulfilling my requests, it should come as no surprise that I have come to personally insist that they are handled with the utmost urgency."
57,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_CHRYSIELLE_000_012","Now, in order to completely validate my theories and protect them from any further impugnations, I have need of your talents. I require more samples to prove that the moon─and indeed, the stars beyond─are teeming with life!"

59,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_LUBDAHRM_000_014","What nonsense! Surely the requests made by various departments of the Studium come first! Our pupils are the lifeblood and future of Sharlayan, and we must needs provide them with hands-on instruction in the classification of specimens from both Thavnair and Garlemald."

We have a talented individual here capable of exploring environs unlike any known to man, and you would have <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> go to <Emphasis>Labyrinthos</Emphasis>? I will not stand for it─not when myriad discoveries await in the field of xenobiology!"

66,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_NORTHOTA_000_019","Anyroad, they will doubtless find it in themselves to behave if it means they'll get their precious samples. If you are keen to learn more about our elite marks, don't hesitate to make use of them."
67,"TEXT_AKTKYR204_04179_NORTHOTA_000_020","For our part, we're counting on you, so...best of luck out there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
