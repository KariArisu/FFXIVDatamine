1,"TEXT_SUBWIL088_00336_SEQ_01","Fufulupa has accidentally overheard Merilda's tale regarding the bandits and their plans to obtain Nashachite stolen from Copperbell Mines. Before you can stop him, the Brass Blade runs to tell his supervising officer─who, unbeknownst to Fufulupa, is cooperating with the bandits. Find Captain Baldewyn before Fufulupa does!"
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL088_00336_SEQ_02","You arrive too late to prevent Fufulupa from confronting his captain, and are forced to battle the corrupt officer and his bandit ally. Baldewyn remains defiant even after you defeat him, until the disgraced Captain Leofric reveals that Baldewyn was in fact operating without Lord Lolorito's knowledge and will therefore face severe punishment for his crimes. Return to Horizon and speak with Fufulupa when next you have an opportunity."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL088_00336_SEQ_03","Due to the events at the Footfalls, Baldewyn has been stripped of his rank, leaving the Brass Blades of the Rose without a captain. For now, Fufulupa will serve as acting captain of the Horizon garrison. Though the young Lalafell believes this to be a temporary arrangement, he swears to do his utmost to protect the people of Horizon."
