1,"TEXT_GAIUSB508_00877_SEQ_01","Unfortunately, there is insufficient space on church grounds to bury the staggering number of deceased Scions. Father Iliud has therefore decided that the dead be buried in the same plots as those who perished in the Calamity five years ago. Sensing that this news might upset you, Sister Eluned suggests that you make a pilgrimage to the mark of the Warden and offer prayers to Azeyma that the imperials face justice for their crimes."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB508_00877_SEQ_02","In remembrance of your fallen brothers and sisters, you kneel before the mark of the Warden. Return to Sister Eluned at the Church of Saint Adama Landama."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB508_00877_SEQ_03","What will result from your pilgrimage can never truly be known. Nevertheless, Sister Eluned believes that the souls of the departed Scions will be comforted by your actions."
