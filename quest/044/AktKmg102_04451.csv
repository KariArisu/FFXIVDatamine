81,"TEXT_AKTKMG102_04451_GRAHATIA_000_115","That's enough reading for one day. As we don't know how long we'll be away, I'd best return these books before we depart."

84,"TEXT_AKTKMG102_04451_KRILE_000_120","If nothing else, these two seem to be in good spirits. Still, I'll see them back to the annex for some proper rest, even if I have to drag them by the ears."
85,"TEXT_AKTKMG102_04451_ALPHINAUD_000_130","A few of our comrades decided to remain a while in Sharlayan after making their deliveries. Did you happen to pass any on your way here?"
86,"TEXT_AKTKMG102_04451_ESTINIEN_000_135","All that remains is to return to the annex and give my armor one last polish. I expect Alphinaud has maintenance to carry out on those...floating things of his, too."
