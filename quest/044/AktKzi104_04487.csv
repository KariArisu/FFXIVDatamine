Verpaulaine is ready to prove he is in the right."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_SEQ_01","Verpaulaine's father appears just as the boy is about to set off in search of him, and he succeeds in convincing Mussalfret that all is not well. The aetherologist fears, in fact, that the artificial sun may be on the verge of exploding. You are entrusted with gathering some soma cores in order to cool the sun.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_SEQ_02","You obtain the requested cores for Mussalfret. The artificial sun has not yet exploded, which seems like a good sign."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_SEQ_03","With the soma cores, Mussalfret wastes no time in returning the artificial sun to a state of stability, and disaster is averted thanks to yours and Verpaulaine's efforts. What's more, the boy's relationship with his father seems to have been mended in the process. Verpaulaine bids you visit him in Sharlayan Hamlet once more so he can thank you properly."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_SEQ_04","Verpaulaine gives you your payment with gratitude and the hope you might meet again once he becomes a researcher in his own right."

50,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_VERPAULAINE_000_002","F-Father! Fancy seeing you here! I was just about to come home and tell you that I found the problem with the sun."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_003","Are you still harping on about that? You could've got yourself hurt pursuing this nonsense!"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_004","And you. I told you to bring my son back to me and instead you go off gallivanting with him!?"

57,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_006","Oh my. I have never seen a core like this in my life. I see no reason to doubt your suggestion that it was feeding on the fire-aspected aether."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_VERPAULAINE_000_007","So you finally admit that I was right about the sun?"
59,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_008","Well, yes... However, that matters not now that I know how serious the situation is."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_VERPAULAINE_000_009","What do you mean? <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s already slain the anala. Surely everything will go back to normal now."

62,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_100_010","If the artificial sun was under such strain for a prolonged period of time, it could be on the verge of combusting by now."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_011","We'll need to cool it posthaste. Alas, this requires multiple soma cores."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_012","The constructs can be found by Kokkol's Forge. Please, we've no time to waste─you must retrieve two cores for me."

70,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_VERPAULAINE_000_020","You've got the cores? Pray give them to my father."

72,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_031","Splendid! Then let us save our sun."
73,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_032","All right. I think we can finally relax. The artificial sun is stable once more."
74,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_033","Clearly, we were all so enveloped in our own research that we neglected to keep an eye on the systems that allow us to live down here in the first place."

77,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_036","And I owe you something else, my son. An apology. I was a fool to ignore your warnings simply because of your age."

79,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_MUSSALFRET_000_038","In that case...might you be interested in helping find potential improvements for the systems that govern our sun?"
80,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_VERPAULAINE_000_039","Of course! I can think of several already!"

84,"TEXT_AKTKZI104_04487_VERPAULAINE_000_052","I hope our paths cross again when I have become a researcher in my own right. I'll be sure to make you proud."
