Though you are no stranger to seeking out rare materials, this particular alloy is believed to be found only in certain highly coveted Allagan artifacts, such as those hidden in the depths of Dalamud's shards. Given the inherent risk in venturing inside these sites, Kokkol has refrained from sending gleaners to procure the adamantite. Luckily for him and the Scions, you have an extensive network of able-bodied warriors ready and willing to undertake such expeditions. With an impromptu linkpearl conversation, Alphinaud arranges for quantities of the metal to be delivered from every corner of the world─along with a Far Eastern relic or two from Othard─which should resolve Kokkol's predicament."
