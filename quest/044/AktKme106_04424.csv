61,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_053","It is the presence of a soul. Yet the soul isn't something you can choose to have at will."
62,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_054","No, it manifests only in those beings whose forms adhere to the laws of creation. That can endure on their own."
63,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_055","Beings that do not fulfill this requirement, such as those spontaneously born of magic or natural phenomena, do not have souls."

65,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_057","So you see, it is not for mankind to decide what is living. That domain lies beyond our manipulation, and it is hubris to assume otherwise."
66,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_058","But come, let us head to the nearby beacon. I've received a report that arcane entities have gathered there."
67,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_EMETSELCH_000_060","We're meant to be observing Hermes, but instead we're stuck with Meteion..."
68,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_EMETSELCH_000_061","Well, I suppose she herself serves as proof of his prowess as a researcher and creator both."
69,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HYTHLODAEUS_000_065","A fascinating creation─much like yourself, little one. Renowned as Hermes is for his flying life-forms, 'tis a rare privilege to be able to see one of his works in progress."
70,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_METEION_000_070","Interesting! You're interesting too! Tell me, how did you find the ambystoma?"
71,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_080","Ah, yes. Lightning pneuma, just as the report said."
72,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_081","Although we call this structure a beacon due to its form, it's in fact a magical device. By manipulating the balance of elements, it keeps the isle airborne and maintains the climate thereupon."
73,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_082","In the course of its operation, it often sees an internal shift towards a given element."
74,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_083","Right now that element is lightning, which draws the pneuma here to replenish their aether."
75,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_084","...Hmm, it appears Meteion is busy."
76,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_085","Would you care to assist me in her stead, and feed the pneuma?"
77,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_086","By using this lightning converger, you can harness ambient lightning and focus it into a ball. A veritable feast for our dazzling friends."
78,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_087","Go on, give it a try."
79,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_090","Go on and use the lightning converger near the pneuma. It will harness ambient lightning and focus it into a ball. A veritable feast for our dazzling friends."

81,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_101","See how they gather to feed. How they express themselves through their actions despite their lack of words."
82,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_102","Speech is not the sole defining characteristic of a thinking, feeling creature. Nor is silence an indication that they do not possess these qualities."
83,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_103","Be it a soulless arcane entity such as the pneuma, or an ephemeral life-form such as the petalouda, all seek to perpetuate their existence. To survive."

85,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_A1_000_105","Is Meteion an arcane entity?"
86,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_A1_000_106","Is Meteion a living being?"
87,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_107","A good question. I can answer it from a theoretical standpoint, but it ultimately falls to the Bureau of the Architect to pass judgment."
88,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_108","Those with exceptional vision such as Hythlodaeus may be able to ascertain her true nature..."
89,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_109","But to me, it doesn't matter. She is herself, and that is all I need to know."
90,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_METEION_000_110","Oh... You've finished already? I-I'm sorry... I was in the way..."
91,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_111","Not to worry, my dear. They missed nothing of note, and we still have plenty of work for them to observe."
92,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HERMES_000_112","Next, we will head east to the Mourning Dew. I need to speak with some observers there."
93,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_EMETSELCH_000_120","...Was there a guiding theme or any method to the madness that is this random assortment of features?"
94,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_HYTHLODAEUS_000_125","Ah, this fellow has been the talk of the bureau! The combination of a carefree aspect and endless rows of fangs is strangely charming!"
95,"TEXT_AKTKME106_04424_METEION_000_130","It's adorable, but beware its sneeze! Hermes went flying once!"
