1,"TEXT_AKTKRA104_04478_SEQ_01","Although the hippokampos is back in fetters, Themis remains worried about the other warders. Erichthonios suggests that they might have found safe haven with the aid of Hesperos, keyward of Asphodelos, and fled to the innermost circle. This seems the best destination for you now─but Erichthonios reveals the path to be blocked by the phoinix, a bird of fulgent flame created in a failed attempt to give life to the sort of phoenix with which you are more intimately familiar. When you set forth steeled for battle, however, the corridor around you warps into a scorched wasteland.

※Asphodelos: The Third Circle can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA104_04478_SEQ_02","You manage to brave the phoinix's flames for long enough to allow Themis and Erichthonios to inter it. The identity of whoever arranged this conflict goes unspoken─yet must be confronted ere you venture further into Asphodelos."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA104_04478_SEQ_03","The hand at work in Asphodelos reveals himself at last, as Hesperos descends from the skies to berate Erichthonios for his foolishness and claim himself a hemitheos─a powerful fusion of man and creation. Declaring that he shall win the adulation of Lahabrea with this form, he then attempts to bind you in arcane chains, though Themis acts quickly enough to dispel the magic and spirit the three of you away. While Hesperos has not followed you, this incident does not bode well for the future of your investigation."
4,"TEXT_AKTKRA104_04478_SEQ_04","The three of you are safe for now, but the other warders are still missing, and deadly creations have free rein of Pandæmonium. Furthermore, Erichthonios seems to be reeling from the revelation that his once-kindly keyward is the wicked force at work within Asphodelos. Themis believes he should be given space for now, but recognizes that time is not in your favor."
