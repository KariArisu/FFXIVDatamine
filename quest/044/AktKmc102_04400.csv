2,"TEXT_AKTKMC102_04400_SEQ_02","You arrive at the Crushing Brand, but you have further yet to go. Your true destination is a nearby cavern, the Chlorophosgrot. The watcher believes the ambient aether there should allow Argos to take form."

7,"TEXT_AKTKMC102_04400_SEQ_07","As you enter into the facility, devices on the lower floor whir to life. They soon open, and from within diminutive rabbit-like creatures emerge in droves, a sight in violent defiance of all expectation. These are Hydaelyn's chosen pilots, however, so perhaps there is more to them than meets the eye."
