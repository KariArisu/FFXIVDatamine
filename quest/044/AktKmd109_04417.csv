1,"TEXT_AKTKMD109_04417_SEQ_01","With Palaka's Stand having regained a moment's peace, you and your companions leave the village in the care of Nidhana, Matsya, and the alchemists. You set off towards Radz–at–Han, stopping along the way to meet Estinien."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMD109_04417_SEQ_02","Estinien is relieved to hear that you and the others have brought the situation at Palaka's Stand under control. For his part, the dragoon assures you that the immediate environs are free of danger. Your mind put at ease, you make for Alzadaal's Path, where Thancred awaits."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMD109_04417_SEQ_03","Thancred is glad of your safe return, and is pleased to inform you that the threat within the city has been likewise quelled. He further explains that the citizens have been summoned to the square, where a proclamation of great import is to be made. At your friend's behest, you promise to convey the news to those who appear uninformed as you make way for Meghaduta yourself."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMD109_04417_SEQ_04","You share the news of the proclamation with a young boy who had been hiding for fear of the beasts. In part out of concern for Varshahn, whom the lad considers a friend, he dashes off toward the square as you, too, continue on your way."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMD109_04417_SEQ_05","You deliver word of the impending proclamation to a visibly frightened youth. Though reluctant to return to the site of the recent slaughter─and deeply suspicious of any who might presume to assume leadership in Ahewann's stead─he nonetheless heads off to the square ahead of you."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMD109_04417_SEQ_06","As the citizens congregate before Meghaduta, Vrtra descends from the sky and reveals unto them his secret, thus fulfilling Ahewann's deepest wish and ending the long deception surrounding the satrap's true identity. The great wyrm's words resonate with the people, overcoming their initial surprise and skepticism, and give them hope for Radz–at–Han's future. This historic moment, however, is soon interrupted when Fourchenault and his colleagues from the Sharlayan Forum arrive with shocking news and an even more shocking proposal. The star they live upon is dying, and he would assist the people in escaping it to take refuge on the moon. Sharing his people's deep and abiding love for their home, Vrtra promises he will make no decision that binds them, and retreats with his guests to discuss the matter in private. Not moments after the wyrm and the Sharlayans have taken their leave, Nidhana reappears to share with you her latest theory that a force other than aether empowers the blasphemies and beasts─namely, an energy called akasa, said to be influenced by emotion alone. You ponder the implications of this potential explanation as Nidhana takes her leave and the congregated citizenry go their separate ways."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMD109_04417_SEQ_07","Alphinaud muses on how, despite all that has transpired, much remains a mystery to you about the underlying cause and fundamental nature of the Final Days. Is there truly no way to forestall the star's calamitous fate? If there is a way, where might such answers be found? Only one thing is certain─you and your companions will not give up hope until all possibilities have been explored."
