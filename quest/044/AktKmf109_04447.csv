71,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_047","As we have established, refined adamantite is a product of Allag. Of the empire's twilight years, in fact."
72,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_048","It was a material which saw much use as part of the Allagans' efforts to extend beyond the bounds of this world─Dalamud, of course, being the most prominent."
73,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_049","Of those who would push further─expand Allag's empire to encompass the heavens and the stars above─perhaps the greatest was its infamous technologist, Amon."

77,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_053","He did. He must have had his own reasons, however, for there is no evidence to suggest that he retained memories of his life as an ancient."

80,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_056","If not his memory, though, what drove him to pursue the idea with such fervor?"
81,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_057","This may seem far-fetched, but what if souls, like minds, have...a personality, so to speak? A natural disposition towards which they are inclined?"
82,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_058","We know with relative certainty that it was the gross decadence and inexorable decline of Allag that moved Amon to resurrect Emperor Xande."
83,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_059","The empire's people spoke lightly of death and destruction, experimenting on those they deemed beneath them to fill the emptiness in their hearts."

86,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_062","Amon's desire for his countrymen to conquer the heavens could only be a means to the same end─to instill the people with new purpose."

91,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_067","To reach those stars on wings of adamantite. To travel to the ends of creation and beyond. The promise of hope everlasting...that much I do understand."
92,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_068","But enough musing for now. Why don't we see how Kokkol is getting on?"
93,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_070","I did thoroughly brief Kokkol on refined adamantite's history. I only volunteered to go to the reactor because I was finished and there was little else to do."
94,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_GRAHATIA_000_071","Hopefully that dispels any misapprehensions that I was kicked out for prattling on..."
95,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_KOKKOLDANKKOL_000_080","Whew! I can feel those flames a-blazin' from here!"
96,"TEXT_AKTKMF109_04447_KOKKOLDANKKOL_000_081","Glad you found someone capable, G'raha, but there's not much left for you lot to do."
