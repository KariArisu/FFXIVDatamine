1,"TEXT_AKTKMC107_04405_SEQ_01","Thancred suspects Urianger is keeping secrets again, and while there is no doubt your enigmatic comrade would only do so with the best of intentions, the weary bard cannot help but worry. He asks you to follow Urianger while he and Y'shtola continue to learn what they can of the Final Days."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMC107_04405_SEQ_02","You reach the aetheryte in the central plaza of Bestways Burrow, and spy Urianger heading out to Mare Lamentorum. What could possibly demand his attention outside?"
3,"TEXT_AKTKMC107_04405_SEQ_03","Stepping out from the entrance to Bestways Burrow, you see Urianger making his ascent up and out to Mare Lamentorum. It would be a simple task to catch up with him, but it would perhaps be wiser to follow at a distance and see where he is heading.

※You must follow Urianger to complete this task. Return to the designated location should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMC107_04405_SEQ_04","Urianger comes to an abrupt stop, and it becomes clear he has been aware of your presence for some time. The two of you have a candid conversation about Urianger's many regrets, and his aversion to keeping secrets from you and the other Scions moving forward. He then thanks you for this rare opportunity to speak so openly."
