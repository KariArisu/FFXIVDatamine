52,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_020","There is a dizzying, disorienting feeling about this place. As if I could lose my footing at any moment... We must be careful."
53,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_LIVINGWAY_000_025","Don't hesitate to make the most of the provisions node. There's no telling what you might run into out there, or if anything we have to offer might help, but I'd personally rather brave the unknown with a full pack than an empty one."
54,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ALPHINAUD_000_030","We're fortunate this place can support life...albeit barely, I suspect, given the torpid, stale quality of the air..."
55,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ALPHINAUD_000_031","But never mind that. We must find Thancred. Let's begin our search from the prow of the ship. It seems as good a direction as any."

58,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_URIANGER_000_045","These remains have long since turned to ash...and yet, they retain their form."
59,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_YSHTOLA_000_050","There is a structure here in front of me, yes? A tower of some sort, partially melted? Hmm. In a strange twist of fate, it seems our perception of this place is not so different as it would be elsewhere."
60,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_YSHTOLA_000_051","The world as I used to see it... It feels as though I am dreaming while awake. This is more than the faded memory Meteion led us to believe."

65,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ALPHINAUD_000_080","Be careful, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I cannot shake the feeling we're being watched. Gods, you don't think there are ghosts here...do you?"
66,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_SYSTEM_000_090","The metallic pillar has been partially melted, likely sometime in the distant past."
67,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_SYSTEM_000_091","The damage does not appear to have been inflicted deliberately. Rather, it calls to mind the indiscriminate destruction often wrought in the heat of battle..."
68,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_GRAHATIA_000_100","Look here─this part is relatively intact."
69,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_GRAHATIA_000_101","The intricate design of the top suggests it is man-made, though its builders were surely not men as we conceive of them."
70,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_GRAHATIA_000_102","Having said that, I swear I have seen this pattern before..."

72,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_110","I thought this hill might afford a better view of our surroundings... A poor decision in hindsight."
73,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_111","Besides the light from the ship, all is shrouded in darkness. If Thancred is here, I'd never know it."
74,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_112","From what I can tell, we are near the edge of an island─if you can call it that─surrounded by floating debris."

77,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ALPHINAUD_000_121","As I feared. And still no trace of Thancred."
78,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ALISAIE_000_122","There's nothing but emptiness as far as the eye can see, which, unfortunately, isn't very far."

83,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_A1_000_127","I think I might see something over there..."
84,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_A1_000_128","I felt it too when I was near that thing..."
85,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ALISAIE_000_129","What are you talking about? There's nothing there."
86,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_YSHTOLA_000_130","Before we jump to any conclusions, perhaps we should search elsewhere."
87,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ALPHINAUD_000_131","Agreed. We've found only more questions when we are in desperate need of answers."
88,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_132","There's a fair stretch of terrain from the ship's port side we've yet to explore."
89,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ALPHINAUD_000_133","Let us try searching there, then."
90,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_134","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. A word, before we join the others."
91,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_140","You see them too, don't you? The dragons."
92,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_141","As I thought. Their presence is tenuous at best, but there's no mistaking it."
93,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_142","No doubt your bond with Midgardsormr, and mine with Nidhogg, is what allows us to perceive them."
94,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_143","Could these apparitions be related to the dragons that now live on Etheirys?"
95,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_144","...Bah. Better to leave such conjecture to the others. In any case, we must be careful. We may soon find dragons they can see as well."
96,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_145","Hmm... Death and anguish. What happened to them, I wonder?"
97,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ALPHINAUD_000_150","Look there! Are those...are those ghosts, do you think?"
98,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_URIANGER_000_155","Surely, mine eyes deceive me. This cannot be possible."
99,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_YSHTOLA_000_160","My sight may have been restored after a fashion, but I fear what I see cannot be trusted..."
100,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_YSHTOLA_000_161","It's as if Meteion herself has etched these images upon my heart. I doubt not that such a feat is within her power, given that she constructed this sanctuary herself."
101,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_GRAHATIA_000_165","Dragons... 'Tis true they are not of our world. But to find them in a prison of despair..."
102,"TEXT_AKTKMG104_04453_ESTINIEN_000_170","It seems these dragons have yet to succumb completely to the darkness of this place. Meaning the others should see them as well."
