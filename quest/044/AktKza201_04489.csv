Ogul is looking around in trepidation."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_SEQ_01","Horrified at landing on an isle populated by Matanga, Ogul is desperate to earn enough coin to buy passage on a departing ship. She asks that you accompany her to Kancana, a woman who purportedly has well-paying jobs on offer.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_SEQ_02","You approach Kancana who, much to Ogul's dismay, is a Matanga herself. Despite Ogul's fearful reaction, you nevertheless secure an escort duty which requires you to meet an Arkasodara master artisan to the west of Yedlihmad."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_SEQ_03","The master artisan welcomes your somewhat belated arrival. Before he can give you instructions, however, Ogul decides that rushing off to gather materials herself would be best for everyone involved. You are left to conduct a patrol of the area alone, but deem it wise to keep one eye peeled for the unsteady Auri warrior."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_SEQ_04","You come across a petrified Ogul standing motionless between a raging beast and one of the aforementioned artisans. After making short work of the aggressive wildlife, you turn your attention to the wounded Arkasodara."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_SEQ_05","The Arkasodara insists that his injuries are slight, and that he is fit to make the journey back towards town. Return to the master artisan west of Yedlihmad."
6,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_SEQ_06","Your employer thanks you for saving his colleague. Your payment, it seems, can be collected from Kancana back in Yedlihmad proper."
7,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_SEQ_07","You receive your promised reward from Kancana, as well as her heartfelt approval. The offer of future work hangs in the air, but considering Ogul's deep-seated fear of all things Matanga, you wonder if she might not require your continued assistance..."

55,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_005","I do not doubt your word. But Grandmother would always warn me: “If you encounter a Matanga, you turn tail and flee─as fast and far as you can!”"
56,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_006","Her tales were awful and bloody, and so now the very sight of them, it... The terror rises unbidden! No, I cannot stay here. I must earn enough coin to buy passage from this nightmare island as soon as possible!"
57,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_007","I beg of you, stay at my side for a time─just until I meet with this “Kancana” person the sailors told me about. She is said to have work that pays a fair wage, so I will see what she has for me..."

66,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_KANCANA_000_015","You <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> looking for work, though, yes? Many have been forced to take what they can get since the troubles began, so I'm afraid all the simple jobs are gone."
67,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_KANCANA_000_016","As for what's left, I only have tasks fit for seasoned fighters. Does that sound like something you could do?"
68,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_017","F-Fighting? I can fight! Lest you doubt, my skill is likened to that of the Dragonbane─the legendary Chakha Zoh herself!"
69,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_KANCANA_000_018","I'm...not familiar with the name, but you sound formidable indeed. Why don't we start you out on escort duty, then. A group of artisans set off to harvest materials, and asked that I send any prospective protectors their way should I happen to enlist any."
70,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_019","What? They already set off? Is our duty not to “escort” them?"

72,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_020","Hmmm..."
73,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_021","And, uh, these artisans you speak of...d-do they also include Matanga in their number?"

83,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_032","Of course─I should have thought of it before! I shall harvest the necessary ingredients while the artisan stays here. That way I have no need to fear him...er, being harmed! Perfect!"
84,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_ARTISANA04489_000_033","I must say, this is less than ideal. My people are already scattered across the wilds, and I wanted someone to roam around and ensure they were safe from attack..."
85,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_ARTISANA04489_000_034","Is your friend perhaps frightened by Arkasodara? I have met such travelers before. Well, no matter. If you could patrol the area as I asked, I must attend to my own harvesting."
86,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_SYSTEM_000_035","Ogul has run off into the wilds alone. Keep an eye out for her as you continue your patrol."
87,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_036","T-Tusks, trunks, bone-crunching feet..."
88,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_ARTISANB04489_000_040","You must think me foolish. I was so absorbed in my task that I failed to notice the ground shaking at their approach..."
89,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_ARTISANB04489_000_041","Still, my injuries are light and my satchel is full. Thanks to you, I think I can make it back to town in time to meet the others."
90,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_042","<gasp> I... What happened!?"
91,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_100_042","Did <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> slay the beast?"
92,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_043","That was a near thing. I took the first one by surprise, but the second... Knowing a Matanga stood at my back, my mind froze and my body refused to obey."
93,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_044","Grandmother taught that we should let fear wash over us like water, but to my shame, I could not have failed her more thoroughly. ...Not to sound ungrateful, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but why did you follow me?"
94,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_045","...We were to patrol? Forgive me. I should have waited for orders, instead of running off alone and putting lives in peril."

100,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_053","Right... I suppose we report to Kancana, then."
101,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_OGUL_000_054","I had no such troubles in Doma or Kugane, I assure you. This is...different."
102,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_KANCANA_000_060","Ah, there you are. Your employer expressed satisfaction with your work, so congratulations on a job well done!"
103,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_KANCANA_000_061","As a response to the recent chaos, the upcoming ritual was hastily planned to say the least. As a consequence, the artisans have been hard-pressed to make everything ready."
104,"TEXT_AKTKZA201_04489_KANCANA_000_062","But when times are hard, the people of Thavnair rely on such traditions to renew their faith and bolster their hearts with the teachings of the divine."
