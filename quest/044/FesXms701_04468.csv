※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS701_04468_SEQ_01","Amh Garanjy welcomes you to this year's Starlight Celebration, and introduces you to her new friend─a diminutive yeti named Rudy, who appears to have something to say to her. Though you are at first at a loss to understand the words of the little snow creature, the auspice Rissai conveniently arrives on the scene. Through his interpretation, you learn of Rudy's heart-wrenching tale of rejection by his brothers, and his gratitude to the Saint of Nymeia, who saved him in his time of need after he became lost in the forest. Moved by his courage, you agree to aid him in expressing his thanks by serving as one of the saint's little helpers. Together with Rissai, you resolve to come up with a plan for how best to get Rudy involved in the Starlight Celebration.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

His role as a saint's helper decided, the little yeti's eyes light up with delight. There is one rub, however, in that neither you nor Rissai has experience in making this particular kind of confection. Fortunately, Rissai has just the person in mind, and along with Rudy you set off for the Carline Canopy to seek Mother Miounne's aid."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS701_04468_SEQ_03","Thanks to Miounne, you have everything you need to make Rudy's celebratory confections─everything, that is, besides the necessary ingredients. There is shopping to be done, and Rudy is eager as always to take on the task. The first item on your list is flour from the Whistling Miller in Old Gridania."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS701_04468_SEQ_04","You watch over Rudy fondly as he conducts his very first errand, managing to obtain the necessary flour with little difficulty on his own thanks to the shopping list provided by Mother Miounne. Eager to continue, he scampers off to the Botanists' Guild for the next ingredient: cooking oil."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS701_04468_SEQ_05","Though his beastly appearance initially spooks the shopkeep, Rudy once again manages to triumph over the odds and successfully complete his task.

6,"TEXT_FESXMS701_04468_SEQ_06","Mother Miounne guides you and Rudy through the confection-making process with an experienced, gentle hand, and before you know it, a full batch of delicious treats has been prepared. Confident that these will surely bring joy to every child who receives them, you leave Miounne to finish packing them up and set off to report back to Amh Garanjy, who will undoubtedly be delighted at your contribution to the festivities."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS701_04468_SEQ_07","Back at the amphitheatre, Amh Garanjy is overjoyed to hear of how much Rudy has accomplished already, and expresses her wish to see him grow even more.
