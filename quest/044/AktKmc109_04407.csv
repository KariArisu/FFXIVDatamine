1,"TEXT_AKTKMC109_04407_SEQ_01","Growingway suddenly remembers where the Scions can learn more about the Final Days─the archives located on the second floor of the main plaza. He asks you to follow him as he hops off with all haste."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMC109_04407_SEQ_02","In a seemingly unexpected turn of bad luck, the entrance to the archives is locked. Growingway suggests you go and find whoever holds the door's key, but Y'shtola has already seen through his ruse. He soon confesses that he was tasked with distracting you, Y'shtola, and Thancred while Livingway and the other Loporrits carry out an ulterior task. With their plan now exposed, the Loporrits intend to detain you by force if necessary."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMC109_04407_SEQ_03","Before reinforcements can overwhelm you, the three of you split up, incapacitating any Loporrits that get in your way. Their motives are not yet clear, but you all agree Urianger must be found before the situation turns dire."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMC109_04407_SEQ_04","You find Urianger near the Watcher's Palace in the midst of conversation with Livingway and her companions. Their plan, it seems, was to coerce Urianger to travel back to Etheirys alone where he would assist their collaborators. He refuses, and instead begs the Loporrits be patient, for he believes the people of Etheirys will do what is right in due time. Rather than return, he pledges to remain on the moon, where he will teach the Loporrits what they need to know of Etheirys to better prepare the moon in the event an evacuation becomes necessary."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMC109_04407_SEQ_05","Should the worst come to the worst, you must be prepared for every eventuality. And so it is with a heavy heart Urianger bids you safe journey back to Etheirys."
