1,"TEXT_AKTKMD107_04415_SEQ_01","As she surveyed the dense jungle, Alisaie caught sight of someone being pursued by a great beast. Whether or not that person is Mehvan remains to be seen, but regardless, you must give chase."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMD107_04415_SEQ_02","The figure Alisaie spied was indeed Mehvan, but before you and the twins can slay her pursuer, the beast seizes the poor woman and casts her into the dark waters, along with her infant child. Without hesitation, you dive into the water after the pair."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMD107_04415_SEQ_03","You find Mehvan and know at once she has drawn her last breath. With yet another tragedy weighing heavy on your heart, you cast about the water for her child."

In that moment, you are beset by yet more terrible beasts. Entrusting the child's safe return to an anxious-yet-determined Matsya, you and your companions prepare for battle."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMD107_04415_SEQ_06","Alphinaud takes stock of your current situation, observing that─for what small comfort it might offer─the ill-fated Qerasaf and Mehvan perished without being transformed into beasts themselves, meaning their souls will return to the aetherial sea. Having done all that can be done, you and your companions prepare to move on."
