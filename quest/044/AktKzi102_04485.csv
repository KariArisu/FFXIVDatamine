Verpaulaine is chuffed that you're helping him."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_SEQ_01","After briefly explaining the artificial sun's inner workings, Verpaulaine bids you accompany him on a visit to Phoibos. You make your way to Logistikon Alpha so you can head to the Medial Circuit.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_SEQ_02","Thanks to your mature comportment, you and Verpaulaine successfully enter the Medial Circuit. The boy dashes off immediately, rather defeating the point of your accompanying him, but you turn toward Phoibos nevertheless."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_SEQ_03","Upon your catching up with him at Phoibos, Verpaulaine asks that you wait while he examines the facility for any issues. Though the Lalafell stationed at Phoibos says nothing, there is the distinct sense that he will be keeping a close eye on the youth during their tour."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_SEQ_04","Verpaulaine reports that he was unable to find anything amiss. However, the youth remains confident that the problem exists, and its cause simply lies elsewhere. You have little choice but to agree to accompany him as he searches for it."

49,"TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_VERPAULAINE_000_001","Oh, I suppose I should tell you a bit about the artificial sun first. It's got an engine called a “reactor” that burns with fire aether."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_VERPAULAINE_000_002","My theory is that the reactor has <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> much aether now, and that's what's changed its color."

52,"TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_VERPAULAINE_000_004","It's in the Medial Circuit, so we should head for Logistikon Alpha first. Follow me so you don't get lost."

66,"TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_PHOIBOSSTAFF_000_034","Nor have we been able to confirm this change in the light's hue you speak of. Are you certain you didn't just stare at the sun too long? We advise against that for a reason, you know."
