159,"TEXT_AKTKMD102_04410_MIHLEEL_000_282","Yes...that is the same Khalzahl, no doubt. A rather successful man, from what I gather."
160,"TEXT_AKTKMD102_04410_MIHLEEL_000_283","That said, it was clear that he had fallen on hard times of late. Those ghastly towers popping up everywhere cannot have been good for business."
