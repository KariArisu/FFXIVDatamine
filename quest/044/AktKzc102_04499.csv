Rimelnaud perhaps requires some thawing."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_SEQ_01","Upon significant prompting from Rimelnaud, Appius mentions that a replacement carburetor will be required to fix one of the camp's ceruleum engines. You agree to head to Monitoring Station G in order to extract one from an engine there.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_SEQ_02","You search ceruleum engine innards as instructed, and come up with what is, as far as you can tell, an intact carburetor."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_SEQ_03","Appius wastes no time in repairing the ceruleum engines, and it soon transpires that he is originally from the area currently occupied by the camp. He explains that his motivation for reactivating the platform is to make returning to the area a viable proposition for those who once inhabited it, and is naturally delighted when Rimelnaud promises to broach the topic with his superior."

55,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_008","After I've swapped out the faulty part and made my other repairs, I'll warm the engines up properly. That should clear any ceruleum residue and allow them to run at full capacity once more."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_009","With that in mind, I want to start taking things apart. Can you fetch the carburetor for me? Do you even know what a carburetor <Emphasis>is</Emphasis>?"

61,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_RIMELNAUD_000_012","If you're certain... You will need to look for a sort of tube connected to the ceruleum engine's core. Many magitek devices utilize them."

68,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_032","There─everything's in order. These should be much more efficient...and you'll notice they've stopped making strange and ominous noises!"
69,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_RIMELNAUD_000_033","I must say, I am taken aback by your abundance of skill. Allow me to thank you on behalf of everyone here at Camp Broken Glass."

72,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_036","In a way... I hail from Laterum, as it happens."
73,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_037","It was a village here─precisely where your camp is now. It acted as a checkpoint for those visiting the capital, but it was also home to the rigs' workers and our families."

76,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_040","Oh, no, I couldn't blame you for that. We hardly had a viable alternative to abandoning Laterum, knowing we could never defend ourselves against wandering bands of maddened soldiers, but that reality is no more your fault than ours."
77,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_041","Even if you vacated right this instant, I doubt many of us would return. We simply don't have the resources..."
78,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_042","Until Juturna Platform G is back in working order, that is."
79,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_043","Truth be told, your presence here is what has me daring to hope. If you agree to help me now, there may come a day when the other survivors and I can come home."
80,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_RIMELNAUD_000_044","Fury above, I certainly can't turn you away now...and you've proven yourself with your work this day. I've no lingering qualms about approaching my superiors with your proposal."
81,"TEXT_AKTKZC102_04499_APPIUS_000_045","Truly? Oh, I could kiss you!"
