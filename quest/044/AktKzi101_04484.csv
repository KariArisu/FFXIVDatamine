Mussalfret is awfully worried about something."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_SEQ_01","Mussalfret informs you that his son, Verpaulaine, has recently fled the family home after a fight and asks you to try and convince him to return. You head to a local park in search of the disgruntled youth.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_SEQ_02","You find Verpaulaine, but he vanishes once more. Undeterred, you begin your search anew."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_SEQ_03","After tracking down Verpaulaine, you learn that he is concerned by a change in the color of Labyrinthos's artificial sunlight. The boy says he wishes to look into the cause himself and you gladly agree to help him."

50,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_A1_000_001","Why was there a child here in the first place?"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_A1_000_002","I thought only researchers lived here."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_MUSSALFRET_000_002","Ah, yes. Simply put, my wife and I work at Aporia and she happened to conceive whilst we were living here in Sharlayan Hamlet."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_MUSSALFRET_000_003","I assure you we had many sleepless nights wondering if we should quit our jobs and leave Labyrinthos, or entrust the child to a friend of ours who dwells somewhere more suitable."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_MUSSALFRET_000_004","Ultimately, we decided to continue our work whilst raising the child here. After all, our research is focused on the very future that our offspring will inhabit."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_MUSSALFRET_000_005","The issue is, however, that the magic that prevents us from revealing anything confidential is too potent to be used on children."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_MUSSALFRET_000_006","Of course, we can't allow the little one to roam freely─there's no telling what he might impart unto others─so he has spent his entire life thus far within the confines of Sharlayan Hamlet."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_MUSSALFRET_000_007","We recently had a slight spat with him and, well, he decided to flee."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_MUSSALFRET_000_008","I imagine me going after him would only make things worse. Could I ask you to talk to him in my stead? I'm sure he'd be much more willing to listen to...er, anyone other than his parents, at this point."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_MUSSALFRET_000_009","Thank you! Verpaulaine─my boy─is most likely in the plaza to the east. I cannot imagine he struck out any further on his own."

68,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_VERPAULAINE_000_032","Fine, I shall tell you what I've seen. The color of the artificial light here changed recently."
69,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_VERPAULAINE_000_033","I'm sure most people haven't noticed, but when you've spent your whole life here, the difference is like...like night and day!"
70,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_VERPAULAINE_000_034","Even so, no one will take me seriously when I bring it up. All because of my age! Got into a big fight with Father about it..."
71,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_VERPAULAINE_000_035","But Labyrinthos is in danger! Who knows what would happen if the artificial sun broke..."
72,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_VERPAULAINE_000_036","That's why I can't go home just yet. I need to get to the bottom of this first."
73,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_VERPAULAINE_000_037","Although...I am scared to venture outside on my own. They say there's countless monsters out there..."

75,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_Q3_000_000","What will you say?"
76,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_A3_000_001","I'll gladly take your money."
77,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_A3_000_002","You don't need to pay me."
78,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_VERPAULAINE_000_039","I thought you were different from the rest, but now you're treating me like a child too."
79,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_VERPAULAINE_000_040","This is a proper deal, all right? You've got to take my money to make it binding."
80,"TEXT_AKTKZI101_04484_VERPAULAINE_000_041","Then it's settled!"
