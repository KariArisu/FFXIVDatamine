Ogul is tapping her foot impatiently."
1,"TEXT_AKTKZA203_04491_SEQ_01","After checking the contents of her coinpurse, Ogul says that she would feel more comfortable with another job under her belt. She bids you return with her to Yedlihmad, and see what other work Kancana has on offer.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_AKTKZA203_04491_SEQ_02","Ogul enters Kancana's offices, complaining that her coinpurse has been stolen. Sympathizing with the young Au Ra's plight, Kancana offers to put her up for the night, as well as prepare a meal for the both of you. Meet with Kancana at her residence in Yedlihmad."
3,"TEXT_AKTKZA203_04491_SEQ_03","You arrive at Kancana's domicile only to discover that her home has been ransacked. According to Kancana, the criminal was leaving the scene just as they arrived, and Ogul dashed off in pursuit without a second thought. The concerned Arkasodara would have you chase after Ogul, and see that she comes to no harm."
4,"TEXT_AKTKZA203_04491_SEQ_04","You find Ogul standing in the street, cursing after having lost sight of her prey. Convinced that the culprit was the same boy who took her coinpurse, she asks that you aid her in gathering information from the locals that might help lead to the thief's apprehension."
5,"TEXT_AKTKZA203_04491_SEQ_05","The locals you speak with seem to agree that the recent spate of thievery is all the work of the same young boy. Return to Kancana's offices and share your discovery with Ogul."
6,"TEXT_AKTKZA203_04491_SEQ_06","You report your findings to Ogul, and she responds with her own unsettling tale. It seems that the boy thief may have been employed by a grown man─a stranger who the local children say was offering easy coin in exchange for unspecified “work.” You will need to track down this shady character if you are to hold to account the true culprit behind these crimes."
