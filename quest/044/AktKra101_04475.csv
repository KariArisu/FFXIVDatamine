1,"TEXT_AKTKRA101_04475_SEQ_01","As you stroll through Archons' Design, you are hailed by a Lalafellin researcher who introduces herself as Nemjiji, assistant to one Professor Claudien and tasked with the study of the aetherial sea. She explains that they have recently discovered a crystal of unknown nature, and asks that you take a look in the hopes that you have seen such a thing on your journeys. Nemjiji takes her leave and asks that you come to Claudien's laboratory in Aporia at your soonest convenience."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA101_04475_SEQ_02","Claudien introduces himself and quickly moves to the matter of the crystal, found during a routine observation around the time the exodus was declared. You recognize it immediately as one of the ancients' design, and at a touch, it reveals to you a warning and a plea that you come to “Pandæmonium.” While much remains shrouded in mystery, it is plain that said location is not of this time... Thus does Claudien ask that you return to the past and seek the one to whom the crystal once belonged."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA101_04475_SEQ_03","As you approach the portal in the Ocular, it responds to the crystal in your hand. You step past the threshold and are soon overcome by a blinding light, and when you open your eyes, you find yourself in Elpis with a massive headache. Next to you is a youth with striking features, lying on the ground as if he has been knocked down by some unknown force... How odd. Though your arrival seems to have surprised him─particularly in its trajectory─his demeanor suggests that he is eager to make your acquaintance."
4,"TEXT_AKTKRA101_04475_SEQ_04","Themis explains that he has been tasked with finding out what has happened within Pandæmonium, a facility which houses a menagerie of dangerous creations used for research purposes. Several days ago, irregular aether was detected in its vicinity─ere communications ceased entirely. For the moment, at least, it seems that your goals align."
