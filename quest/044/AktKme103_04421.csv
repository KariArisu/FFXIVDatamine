56,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_017","Very well, I shall make the robe, but perhaps you can assist. Come, let us search for the requisite material."
57,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_EMETSELCH_000_020","No means no. Just be grateful I'm even willing to wait."
58,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_030","Yes, these creatures should suffice."

61,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_033","Now, I should mention that the strength of the rope is tied─no pun intended─to the strength of its user."
62,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_034","As your aether is still thin compared to ours, you'll need to weaken the petaloudai first. Good luck!"

71,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_057","Well, not <Emphasis>just</Emphasis> like that. You need to revert them to their constituent aether first."
72,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_058","Lest you wonder why I asked for two species, it is due to the difference in their aetheric balance. Blending them allows us to produce garb with superior aetheric stability."
73,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_059","Oh, it's fine, there's no one around to tell us off. And besides, we can always make more petaloudai. They need only a tiny amount of aether."
74,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_060","It may take some effort to get the form and composition right, but anyone familiar with the concept should be able to manage."

76,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_062","Fair point, but at the very least it should spare you unwanted attention from casual observers."
77,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_063","Emet-Selch speaks true. Even dressed like us, your unusual nature will be plain to those who think to look."
78,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_064","Should someone question your presence, don't make up excuses, much less try to explain what you actually are. No, best to simply say that you're a familiar."

80,"TEXT_AKTKME103_04421_HYTHLODAEUS_000_066","Ah, of course─Azem's. If you say you belong to <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>, people will give you the benefit of the doubt for any and all outlandish behavior."
