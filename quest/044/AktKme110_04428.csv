82,"TEXT_AKTKME110_04428_HERMES_000_073","Now, I warn you: its abilities are as fiery as its temperament. Once it spots you, it will unleash orbs of flame..."
83,"TEXT_AKTKME110_04428_HERMES_000_074","But fear not. By my measure, you are more than equal to the task. Withstand the onslaught for a few brief moments, and that will give me time to catch it unawares."
84,"TEXT_AKTKME110_04428_HERMES_000_075","...Ready? Then let us begin!"
85,"TEXT_AKTKME110_04428_HERMES_000_080","A few moments is all I require. Just make sure that you command its attention!"

92,"TEXT_AKTKME110_04428_EMETSELCH_000_122","Rationally speaking, I understand Hermes's argument. No matter how well deserved the rest, there is a pang of sadness when a colleague leaves us."
93,"TEXT_AKTKME110_04428_EMETSELCH_000_123","Yet never has a departure caused me such grief as Hermes appears to feel. What must it be like to experience such torment...?"
