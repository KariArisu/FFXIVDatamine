0,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_SEQ_00","The bereaved dragon has fallen silent, leaving Estinien to sigh with frustration."
1,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_SEQ_01","Though you and Estinien hoped to learn more of your surrounds, the dragon shade is committed to resuming its silent vigil. Nevertheless, what little insight you gained may prove to be beneficial, and so the two of you return to rendezvous with the other Scions."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_SEQ_02","After discussing the collected results of your investigations of the island and its inhabitants, prospects for a path forward appear grim, until Y'shtola posits a theory based on Meteion's assertion that emotions dictate reality in this dominion of dynamis. Following Thancred's example, she suspects you must overcome the powerful emotions that maintain the island's current state. Hearing this, Urianger suggests speaking with Al End, a dragon whose sorrow is perhaps most pronounced among his kin. Countering his despair may serve to alter the island, and create a path by which you may advance."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_SEQ_03","Estinien steps forward to confront Al End, and as their exchange grows more intense, something stirs within the timeworn dragon. With a terrible cry, he transforms into a small, black bird, and summons a swirling vortex that consumes Estinien. In the blink of an eye, another friend is lost, but in his wake a powerful wind begins to blow, and a path leading away from the island opens."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_SEQ_04","You and your comrades follow the wind, until you reach a cliff with a localized cyclone at its edge. Alphinaud bids you go on ahead, that he might have a moment to gather his thoughts."
5,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_SEQ_05","Though Estinien is no more, he is still with you in spirit, as is Thancred. For their sake, and for all those who yet live on Etheirys, you press onward in search of Meteion."

63,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_ALPHINAUD_000_054","We started by traversing the perimeter of the island, to see if there might be a path leading off of it. Sadly, there was nothing to be found."

As it crossed an invisible threshold just beyond the boundaries of this island, it vanished, only to reappear above me, and fall at my feet. I would not be too quick to presume that what we see outside this space is as it appears."
67,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_ALISAIE_000_058","Which is why I returned to the <Emphasis>Ragnarok</Emphasis>, and asked the Loporrits to search for a potential path."
68,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_ALISAIE_000_059","However, the ship's instruments failed to provide conclusive data on the surrounding area. Until we know more, I think it too risky to attempt flying to another island."
69,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_GRAHATIA_000_060","What Meteion told us before─that emotions dictate reality here─might be the key. But I'm not entirely sure what emotion might manifest a bridge to lead us to safety."
70,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_ESTINIEN_000_061","So what you're saying is, we've no way forward."
71,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_YSHTOLA_000_062","At present, aye. If it is indeed emotion that governs this island, perhaps it is not Meteion's, but the dragons' that holds us here."
72,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_YSHTOLA_000_063","They tire of conflict, and have chosen a path of oblivion to escape it."

78,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_YSHTOLA_000_069","Meteion meant to unmake us then and there on the <Emphasis>Ragnarok</Emphasis>, and she would have succeeded if not for Thancred's determination."
79,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_YSHTOLA_000_070","She conceded it was strong enough to overpower the despair that otherwise rules Ultima Thule, and reshape it to a degree. Perhaps it can be done again in like manner─by overpowering the prevailing emotions."
80,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_URIANGER_000_071","'Twas Ultima Thule's architect, Meteion herself, against whom Thancred did pit himself in a clash of wills. Though I marked no leader among them, as such, I did chance to encounter a dragon possessed of despair far more potent than most. Potent enough, mayhap, to dictate the course for others─and thus, their domain, to follow."
81,"TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_URIANGER_000_072","He spoke but few words, carefully chosen, their tone and timber alone threatening to rend my heart in twain. Challenging his desire to remain may allow us to alter the island upon which we stand."
