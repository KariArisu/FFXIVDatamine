1,"TEXT_AKTKRA102_04476_SEQ_01","Themis suggests that you journey to Pandæmonium together, both because it will be easier for you to gain access to the sensitive area and because you seem to be the “star” that was foretold by Themis's colleague. The first order of the day is to receive permission from the Words of Lahabrea, which Themis assures you should be a simple matter."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA102_04476_SEQ_02","As Themis promised, your entry into Pandæmonium is granted without issue. While the member of the Words of Lahabrea assures you that any major irregularities in the facility are seen to by Lahabrea himself, Themis seems nonetheless eager to continue his own investigation into matters."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA102_04476_SEQ_03","As you and Themis step foot into Pandæmonium, he reveals that something or someone within is working to erode the chains and barriers which keep the creatures locked away. Though Themis uses his own magic to strengthen the protections for the moment, he suggests you seek one of the warders to gain a more thorough understanding of how the situation might be resolved. He further explains that although he cannot participate directly in battle without relinquishing his focus on the wards, he can create warriors based on your aether to aid you, should it come to that.

5,"TEXT_AKTKRA102_04476_SEQ_05","The warder introduces himself as Erichthonios, and it seems he scarcely remembers the moments leading up to your conflict. What he can tell you is that Asphodelos─the level of Pandæmonium closest to the surface─has become overrun by monsters, and that he became separated from his colleagues in the chaos. Concerned for their safety, he begs Themis to withhold his report to the Convocation so that he can be afforded time to rescue them ere the facility is obliterated. Although Themis cannot openly shirk his duties, he states that his investigation is yet incomplete, and the two of you agree to delve further into the hellish dungeon in search of survivors─and answers."
