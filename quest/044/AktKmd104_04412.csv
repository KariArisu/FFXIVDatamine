1,"TEXT_AKTKMD104_04412_SEQ_01","Having finished your investigation at Ruveydah Fibers, G'raha Tia would reconvene with your companions, that you might discuss all you have learned. With luck, they too will have information of their own to share."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMD104_04412_SEQ_02","Back at the plaza, you share your findings with your fellow Scions. They are troubled to learn that the first transformation occurred before the sky began to burn, strongly suggesting that the change could occur elsewhere without any warning whatsoever. As you ponder the implications, the satrap appears to inform you that the threat within the walls of Radz–at–Han has been quelled. No sooner has he attempted to give assurance to his people than does the young fisherman Matsya rush to the scene, exclaiming that Palaka's Stand is surrounded by fiends. Fearing for the safety of her grandson in the village, an inconsolable woman falls into a panic. Consumed by ominous black mist, she subsequently transforms into a beast before your eyes. You manage to subdue the threat, but at great cost, for in the midst of battle, Ahewann gives his life to save a young father. Devastated and demoralized by all you have witnessed, you and your companions nevertheless resolve to make for Palaka's Stand and save what souls may yet be saved."

5,"TEXT_AKTKMD104_04412_SEQ_05","You dispatch two more beasts and clear a way to Palaka's Stand. Upon your arrival, however, you and your companions are confronted with a devastating sight. Dead and wounded lie strewn about, and tortured sobs and screams fill the air."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMD104_04412_SEQ_06","Shaken by the tragedy unfolding before her eyes, Alisaie steels her nerves and resolves to aid the villagers who are still alive. She bids you do the same, and you set out to offer what succor you can."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMD104_04412_SEQ_07","To your dismay, most of the villagers you seek out are beyond saving. Resigned, you turn back to Alphinaud, ready to discuss your next plan of action."
8,"TEXT_AKTKMD104_04412_SEQ_08","While he laments those villagers who have lost their lives, Alphinaud fears that many more may have been transformed into beasts. If so, the carnage in Palaka's Stand is only the beginning..."
