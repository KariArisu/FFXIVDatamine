1,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_SEQ_01","Operation Eagle's Nest has failed, and the IVth Imperial Legion once again has the Resistance on the back foot. Bajsaljen is not one to be discouraged, however, and has already begun considering counter-strategies. Believing your counsel essential, he has requested an audience with you."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_SEQ_02","A report from Bwagi reveals the imperial legion's strength is not what it seems. In fact, they are now starved for resources, which has prompted allied forces from Dalmasca and Nagxia to launch an assault and thus slow the arrival of reinforcements to Bozja. The meeting is soon interrupted when a fatigued soldier enters, warning of yet another sighting of Queen Gunnhildr. For reasons as yet unknown, this prompts Mikoto to run off, likely to the southern front."
3,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_SEQ_03","What Mikoto expects to find on the battlefield remains to be seen, but the others bid you go and find her, fearful she may discover more than she hopes for."
4,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_SEQ_04","You find Mikoto unharmed, spying on Misija and a group of imperials. Once again, the vision of Queen Gunnhildr appears, though her power is noticeably diminished from your previous encounter. As you turn to leave, Mikoto's gift of the Echo offers an insight into the future─she sees the Resistance cornering Misija, who is unable to wield the power of Save the Queen. Mikoto would waste no time in relaying this news to the Resistance."
5,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_SEQ_05","Mikoto is convinced the apparition Misija has used to drive back Resistance forces is born of the memories of the late Queen Gunnhildr. She goes on to explain the fabled blade Save the Queen was likely designed to function in a similar fashion to the auracite you encountered in Rabanastre. Assuming this is true, Misija's plans cannot come to fruition without a substantial cache of crystals, meaning there may yet be time for the Resistance to strike back."

But since then, Queen Gunnhildr has been quick to join the fray each time we engage their forces, leaving us little choice but to retreat."
54,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_BAISHAEN_000_052","We have sustained heavy casualties. Many of those not slain outright have been made slaves to Misija's will."

93,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MIKOTO_000_251","To speak plainly, I believe the apparition summoned at Castrum Lacus Litore and again on the southern front is not what we would call an eikon or a primal. Not in the strictest sense of the term."

95,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MARSHAK_000_253","According to our records, Queen Gunnhildr wielded the power of the blade not to summon a god, but to become one, that she could protect our people."
96,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_LILJA_000_254","So she made herself a vessel for its power, then?"

98,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MIKOTO_000_256","Tales passed down through the ages state much the same. It appears Queen Gunnhildr was able to call upon its power at will."
99,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_BAISHAEN_000_257","Then that would mean that a living vessel is required to wield the blade's true power. But that does not explain why it instead manifested in the form of Queen Gunnhildr."
100,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MIKOTO_000_258","Based on our experience in the castrum and what we observed on the southern front, I believe the blade was imbued with the queen's memories in the form of aether at the moment of her death, and that the crystal focus was used to draw them out."
101,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MIKOTO_000_259","Does that not sound familiar, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Aether absorbed into a vessel, and thereafter used to call forth unspeakable monstrosities."
102,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MIKOTO_000_260","Precisely. It is a phenomenon quite similar to the auracite we discovered in Rabanastre."
103,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MIKOTO_000_261","As you may recall, Argath Thadalfus harbored a burning desire to rule, which was made manifest in the ruins of Lesalia."
104,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_BWAGI_000_262","Aye, it was the same for my brother, Ba'Gamnan. His guilt over the deaths of the prince and princess served as a catalyst for his own grisly transformation."
105,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_BAISHAEN_000_263","...I see. From what we have learned of the holy blade thus far, it has much in common with auracite."
106,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MIKOTO_000_264","This is merely conjecture, but I suspect that Save the Queen was actually crafted from auracite, and altered to amplify the desires of whoever wields it."
107,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MARSHAK_000_265","But who would be capable of such a feat?"
108,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MIKOTO_000_266","I cannot say with any certainty, but together with the crystal foci, it is reminiscent of ancient Allagan technology. How it found its way into the hands of Bozjans is anyone's guess."

111,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_LILJA_000_269","It seems like it. But on the other hand, Misija can keep conjuring it up as many times as she wants."
112,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_GEROLT_000_270","Considerin' what it was designed for, that shade o' the queen is the least of our worries."
113,"TEXT_LUCKSA201_04025_MIKOTO_000_271","Indeed. Misija's ultimate goal is likely to become a vessel for the blade's power, much like the queen did to avert the Fourth Umbral Calamity."
