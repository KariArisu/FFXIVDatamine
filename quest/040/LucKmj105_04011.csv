1,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_SEQ_01","In your quest to cure as many of the tempered as possible, it is decided that you will turn to the wisdom of Master Matoya, the realm's foremost authority on familiars. Wasting no time, you set out for the Archon's hidden refuge in the Dravanian hinterlands."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_SEQ_02","Stepping into the dimly lit cave, you are greeted by the perennially cantankerous Matoya in typically biting fashion. “Pleasantries” thus exchanged, she demands to know your reason for coming, and Y'shtola dutifully explains your need for more familiars to play the role of Angelo. Pondering the challenge of producing a veritable herd of the creatures, the elderly Archon proposes creating a mother porxie who would in turn create the necessary porxies, and with a mixture of nostalgia and annoyance, makes mention of a certain moldy old hole..."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_SEQ_03","The place to which Matoya so fondly alluded is soon revealed to be her abandoned workshop in the Makers' Quarter. There, she declares, you will be able to obtain all of the necessary ingredients for the mother porxie, and put them to use. You duly set off for the workshop's entrance, where a poroggo guide awaits."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_SEQ_04","At your word, the poroggo named Puro Roggo will show you into Matoya's Relict, that you might set about making your familiar-making familiar.

5,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_SEQ_05","At the end of your ramble through the relict, you succeed in creating─and subsequently taming─the mother porxie. All that remains is to see if she can produce a litter of little helpers."
6,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_SEQ_06","After G'raha Tia imbues the mother porxie with his magick, Y'shtola provides the familiar with the energy she needs to give birth. And give birth she does, to three bouncing baby Angelos, as all look on approvingly."
7,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_SEQ_07","Your task in the relict thus accomplished, you rejoin your comrades outside. Though it will still be hard work to create the porxies, the process has been made a great deal more manageable, bringing you another step closer to finding a lasting solution to the primal problem."

53,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_ALISAIE_000_011","Do you remember? When last we came here, it was to find out why the others had collapsed. If someone had told me then that they'd been whisked away to another world, I would probably have laughed in their face. You live and learn, eh?"
54,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_GRAHATIA_000_012","Master Matoya is something of a legend among Archons. I very much look forward to meeting her...if not the dressing down I am liable to receive for my inept attempts at summoning you."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_YSHTOLA_000_020","I take it you are ready to bear witness to the joyous reunion of master and pupil? Very well..."

63,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_YSHTOLA_000_041","That may be, but no one has set foot in there since the exodus. I dread to imagine what has become of it."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_MATOYA_000_042","Oh, there's sure to be a handful of feral familiars and mayhap a monster or two. But nothing to trouble the likes of you. You can consider cleaning up the place payment for my help."

66,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_MATOYA_000_044","Good girl. Now, if there are no other objections, I suggest you run along to the Makers' Quarter."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_MATOYA_000_045","I'll send one of my poroggos ahead to let you into the workshop. You need only tell him who you are. One can't be too careful, after all. Off you go."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_MATOYA_000_050","What are you still doing here? Off to the Makers' Quarter with you! I'll join you when I'm ready. Go on, now! Shoo!"
69,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_ALPHINAUD_000_051","As I may have mentioned, Alisaie and I were still very young when we departed with the exodus. I envy Y'shtola for remembering the city as it once was."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_ALISAIE_000_052","The grass could certainly do with a trim..."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_YSHTOLA_000_053","The workshop was an unforgiving place even before the exodus, and I doubt the years of neglect have improved it."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_GRAHATIA_000_054","Judging by the unruly state of the flora without, I think it safe to assume there will be no shortage of unruly fauna within. Add to that the undisturbed secrets of the workshop, and we have the makings of an adventure!"

82,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_YSHTOLA_000_072","I was still a child when last I came here, but now I am rather more capable. Not that Master Matoya seems to have noticed. Mayhap she will when I have cleaned up the mess she left."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_GRAHATIA_000_073","So, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, shall I lead the van? Or would you rather I followed up the rear?"

86,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_GUIDEPOROGGO_100_076","Are you ready, ribbit? But give me the word, and I will show you in."
87,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_ALISAIE_000_080","Given it was her first time making a porxie, Master Matoya did a fine job. Though she did have Angelo for inspiration."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_GRAHATIA_000_081","Forgive me if this is a silly question, but of all creatures real and imagined...why choose a flying pig? Not that I dislike pigs, mind you..."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_MATOYA_100_085","Ugh, my joints were fairly screaming by the time I got home, and Shtola was more hindrance than help. In future, I'll thank you to keep your favors closer to my cave."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMJ105_04011_YSHTOLA_100_086","My apologies, but I will rest here awhile. Go on without me."
