1,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_SEQ_01","The chief informs you of a curious rumor─that dwarven automata have been spotted about Eulmore of late. As both the machines and the secrets of their construction are generally to be found within dwarven settlements exclusively, he has a sneaking suspicion that their sudden prevalence elsewhere has something to do with Konogg's departure from Komra. Eager for any chance of setting things right with the youth, he asks that you follow this trail and see if it leads to Konogg."
2,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_SEQ_02","A merchant in Eulmore, located via your uncanny investigative instincts, claims to have done business with a dwarf fitting Konogg's description and inclinations. He generously gives you a piece of parchment indicating the whereabouts of said dwarf's current dwelling─though not without saddling you with wares to deliver. Alas, when you arrive, Konogg is no longer to be found within. Perhaps he departed with Anogg, but whence, who can say..."
3,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_SEQ_03","You give the chief the news of what you found in Konogg's erstwhile home along with the bottle of mead he purchased in Eulmore. He seems disappointed, though unsurprised, lamenting that this affair has been an unfortunate one from start to finish. He further muses that to err is inevitable─a fact with which you, too, must make peace."

50,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_DWARFMASTER03671_000_003","I hear that automata of dwarven make have been spotted about Eulmore of late. Signature frog motif and all."

52,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_DWARFMASTER03671_000_005","I can think of one dwarf who might be, though. One with the right skills, and little else to his name..."

60,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_EULMOREMERCHANT04053_000_052","I did see a dwarf in black, though, yes. Odd little fellow. Came selling one of those Gogg contraptions─not quite to my personal tastes, but a rare find to be sure!"
61,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_EULMOREMERCHANT04053_000_053","He placed an order, as well. Paid in advance! Say... If you're looking for the chap anyway, would you save me some time and take it to him?"

86,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_DWARFMASTER03671_000_106","I will. I only wish things hadn't turned out like this. What happened to the village was bad enough, but then everyone was at each other's throats, and Anogg and Konogg were gone... Don't even get me started on the Glagg debacle."
87,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_DWARFMASTER03671_000_107","I keep turning it all over in my mind, and I see nothing but the mistakes we made. And I wonder, how can any of us be sure that we won't make a mess of things again?"
88,"TEXT_LUCKTA601_04053_DWARFMASTER03671_000_108","Maybe we can't. Maybe we just try to remember, every single day, how bloody wrong we probably are, and...we learn to live with that. Maybe that's the only answer we get."
