59,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERC03954_000_017","I'm in your debt. Here, take this sack. You can slip it over an ironbeard to keep it subdued after you've knocked it around enough."

73,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERC03954_000_171","If you're not too busy, do you think you could retrieve another ironbeard for us? Rest assured you won't be doing it alone this time─I'm going to retrieve one too."
74,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERC03954_000_172","When we're done, let's meet back here. Happy deactivating!"
75,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERB03954_000_180","There're still some among us who don't understand the work we're doing. But like you won us over, we can win them over too."
76,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERD03954_000_181","Sometimes, someone will come over and tell me off. “The hells you thinking, playing around with bits of those machines? It's downright creepy!” they'd say."
77,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERD03954_000_182","I don't let it discourage me, though. This is what I've chosen to do, and I'm going to keep doing it, rain, hail, or doom."
78,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERC03954_000_200","Ugh, of all the times to get a cramp... You go on ahead─I'll be on my way as soon as I can... <grunt>"
79,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERC03954_000_250","Whew... It was rough going even with your example, but I managed to shut down an automaton in the end. How about you?"
80,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERC03954_000_251","Great! With these two additional units on duty, I'll be able to spend more time drink─"
81,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERC03954_000_252","Er...I mean, I'll be able to spend more time doing...things. That automata can't do. For the rebuilding. Yes, yes, that's it!"
82,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERC03954_000_253","...Ahem. Thanks to you, I've found something that I can do for Komra. But as helpful as you are, it wouldn't do to rely on you forever. No, from this point on, I want to make sure I can get by on my own when the time comes."
83,"TEXT_LUCKTA523_04052_VILLAGERC03954_000_254","There might be others who could use a hand, though, so you ought to talk to the chief. Thanks again, and be seeing you!"
