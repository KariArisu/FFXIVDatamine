0,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_SEQ_00","'Tis that season of the year again, and Amh Garanjy is making plans for an extra special Starlight.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_SEQ_01","Amh Garanjy greets you with a smile, heartened by your arrival. It would seem the ever-unflappable Starlight celebrant has been plagued by more trouble than usual in preparing for this year's festivities─such that the celebration itself is in peril if she cannot secure a capable helping hand, and quickly. Further complicating matters is the presence of Kamlito Halito, son of a prominent merchant from Ul'dah, who has been sent by his father to observe the festivities, but appears to believe himself above it all. Nonetheless, the presence of the Saint of Nymeia is evidence enough that a miracle or two may lie in your future. Should you be willing to lend your aid, you need only speak to her saturnine colleague by the waterwheel storage cabin.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_SEQ_02","The Starlight celebrant welcomes your generous offer of assistance. Your first task, if you choose to accept it: make for the Conjurers' Guild and clean up the most indecorous decorations put up in the area by Kamlito Halito, who clearly has a less-than-stellar understanding of what the Starlight season is all about."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_SEQ_03","Thanks to your diligent work in cleaning up the unsightly decorations left by Kamlito Halito, the scene has now been set to deck the streets with décor more suitable for the season. Return to the saturnine Starlight celebrant with the unneeded baubles and report that your task is done."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_SEQ_04","Taking the improper decorations in hand, the celebrant thanks you for your efforts in his typically unenthusiastic manner, and sets off to decorate the town in more traditional Starlight fashion. He encourages you to return to Amh Garanjy, who will no doubt be overjoyed with your contributions and looking to reward you accordingly."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_SEQ_05","Amh Garanjy beams a smile upon your return, ever more confident that she has found the helper she needs to see that this year's Starlight Celebration is one to remember. Expressing her hope that Kamlito Halito, too, will come to understand the spirit of the season in time, she bids you reward yourself for your efforts with a present from the twinklebox. She further explains that her colleague Baenfaeld, as well, has received missives of gratitude from around the realm intended for you, and encourages you to peruse them from time to time. Many more preparations must be made before Starlight can commence in earnest, and your further aid would be more than appreciated."

50,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_011","Well, if it isn't my favorite adventurer! I see the saint has once again guided you to me in this most wonderful of seasons. Truly, your very presence is a Starlight miracle!"
51,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_012","That said, I'm afraid I must apologize. There has been a bit of a rub, you see, and as such we're not quite ready to kick off the festivities as of yet."
52,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_013","How shall I put it? Our troubles began when we encountered some unexpected delays in deciding on a theme for this year's event. Things spiraled from there, and as a result, we've been left with far too much to do in far too little time."
53,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_015","As a result, we celebrants have been forced to recruit helpers of all stripes─from small children to strapping adventurers like yourself. Speaking of which, you wouldn't perchance be able and willing to lend us a hand, would you?"
54,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_016","Oh, thank you, my friend! I daresay your generosity truly embodies the Starlight season. Without further ado, allow me to explain the tasks we would ask of you."
55,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_GODBERT_000_020","(-Saint of Nymeia-)Ho ho ho! It would seem you've found a most promising helper for me again this year!"

And I suppose this one, too, will also be wanting some kind of <Emphasis>reward</Emphasis> for their services.

Worthless trinkets foisted off on naive young fools in hopes of making them forget the mundanity of their everyday existences.

59,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_024","...Ahem. Allow me to introduce Kamlito Halito, first son of a prominent family of surveyors in Ul'dah. He's journeyed here all the way from the sultanate to help us prepare this year's festivities. Standing beside him is the Saint of Nymeia himself, a man who no doubt needs no introduction."
60,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_KAMLITOHALITO_000_025","Let me state for the record that I did not come here merely to deck the streets with gaudy lights and trinkets. I initially proposed to Father that we do away with all this mummery and transform this festival into something that would contribute more directly to the mutual economic prosperity of our nations and the realm as a whole."
61,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_KAMLITOHALITO_000_026","But did he listen? No, he simply muttered something about how he didn't raise his son to be a stuffy spoilsport, and all but demanded that I accompany Lord Mand─pardon, the <Emphasis>Saint of Nymeia</Emphasis> here to learn something about “holiday cheer”─whatever that is supposed to mean."

65,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_030","Tucked beneath the many lids of this casket are hidden all manner of delightful wares. Why, they've been fashioned especially for this year's festivities by some of the realm's most celebrated crafters!"

70,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_ISAINNE_000_035","But I have plenty of time to help now! Just say what you need and leave it to Isainne to get things done!"

74,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_039","Now then, if you're ready to get started, simply head west from the amphitheatre and speak to my colleague stationed before the waterwheel hut. She'll be happy to explain all you need to know to get started."
75,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_KAMLITOHALITO_000_040","All this work, and for what─to take it all down when the festivities are over? A thorough waste of time and effort, if you ask me..."

77,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_COMMITTEE04017_000_051","Hold your chocobos, now. It's not as if we're calling the celebration off. It's simply that...well, you met Kamlito Halito, yes? He was in charge of this area, and let's just say his sense for what's appropriate for Starlight leaves something to be desired."
78,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_COMMITTEE04017_000_052","I can handle things here by myself, so I'd ask you to head to the Conjurers' Guild and take down any seasonally inappropriate decorations you might find. When you're through, you can bring the inappropriate ornamentation back here to me, and I'll see that it's properly stored away."
79,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_COMMITTEE04017_000_060","Ah, yes. That should do it, then. Isainne here finished cleaning up her assigned area as well─in half the time, I might add."
80,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_ISAINNE_000_061","Did you <Emphasis>see</Emphasis> some of those so-called decorations? It's as if that man has never attended a single day's worth of Starlight festivities in his life!"
81,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_COMMITTEE04017_000_062","At any rate, I suppose I'll see to it that the ornaments you took down are replaced with something more festive. In the meantime, I'd appreciate it if you could report to Amh in my stead."

85,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_081","Allow me also to apologize on Kamlito's behalf for the extra work he created for you. The boy has much to learn, yes, but I've no doubt that he will come to understand what the spirit of the season is all about in due time."

89,"TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_AMHGARANJY_000_084","My colleague Baenfaeld here in the amphitheatre is holding on to them all, so if you're curious, simply say the word─he'd be happy to share the words of appreciation and good cheer."
