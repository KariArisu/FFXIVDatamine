50,"TEXT_LUCKHA031_04042_AUGEBERT_000_002","As Francel doubtless told you, Risensong's to be the new center of culture and aesthetic appreciation here in the Firmament."
51,"TEXT_LUCKHA031_04042_AUGEBERT_000_003","It's a place where nobles and commonfolk alike can now partake in the finer pleasures of life, like a soothing dip in the waters at Snowsoak Springs. We also have a brand-new infirmary, where those sufferin' from all manner of injuries and ailments can get the care they need."

53,"TEXT_LUCKHA031_04042_AUGEBERT_000_005","Aye, you heard me right. The rebirth of the Risensong Quarter marks the culmination of the restoration project in its entirety. I'm sure you'll agree that we've wrought somethin' wonderful here. Truly, I can't thank you enough for lendin' your skills and labor to the cause."
54,"TEXT_LUCKHA031_04042_AUGEBERT_000_006","Hm? What are you all standin' about for? Isn't there work what needs doin' somewhere?"
