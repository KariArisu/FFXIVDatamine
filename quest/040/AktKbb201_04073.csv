※This quest will unlock the reaper job."
1,"TEXT_AKTKBB201_04073_SEQ_01","A flustered attendant explains to you that his employer is being accosted by an unsavory group called the Lemures, which is led by a merciless killer named “the Reaper.” This menacing figure has supposedly threatened the wealth of one Jijilyo, and the merchant has resolved to defend his fortune with his life. Seeking to ensure that his employer lives through the encounter, the attendant has asked you to meet them at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, implying that a handsome reward lies at the end of a day's work."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBB201_04073_SEQ_02","It is not long after your arrival that you are joined by the notorious leader of the Lemures, but instead of attacking, the Reaper asks for coin that is rightfully owed. Clearly, Jijilyo neglected to divulge that he had previously hired the gang to frighten his competition. The standoff turns tense, but as the woman looks you over she is struck with an idea: in exchange for your release into her group's service, she will forgive Jijilyo's debt. Treasuring his own life and not particularly caring about yours, Jijilyo readily agrees, and the Reaper informs you that she will be waiting at Lemures headquarters, located in Pearl Lane."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBB201_04073_SEQ_03","Drusilla, the leader of the Lemures─and a Garlean besides─cuts to the chase and briefs you on your first job: a hunt for a voidsent. This is no simple task, however, and will require that you undergo training as a reaper. To that end, Drusilla asks you to touch the soul crystal on her desk, and a dark figure materializes─your avatar, the source of a reaper's power. To claim these otherworldly abilities, you must first forge a pact to feed the souls of your enemies to this avatar─or rather, the voidsent it represents. Drusilla emphasizes that the choice to do so and join the Lemures is not one to be made lightly, and offers you some time to decide."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBB201_04073_SEQ_04","The choice before you is indeed a grave one, but if you are to walk the path of the reaper, then your answer is a foregone conclusion. You must speak with Drusilla and affirm your conviction.

※In the event that you leave Lemures headquarters, you may re-enter by speaking with the loyal Lemure in Pearl Lane."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBB201_04073_SEQ_05","Drusilla welcomes you into her time-honored order and presents you with a Soul of the Reaper. As you hold it close, you feel the fetters of the covenant with your voidsent tighten and meld into your essence. Drusilla then presents you with a scythe, asking you to feel the heft of it in your hands. Equip the scythe and inquire as to whether the sight meets with Drusilla's approval."
