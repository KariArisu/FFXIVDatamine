49,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_GRAHATIA_100_002","Though I have some passing knowledge of prior events, I am yet ill qualified to meddle in Lominsan affairs. 'Twas not my place to argue with Sicard, much as I would have liked to."
50,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_GRAHATIA_200_002","Nay, it is for the Admiral to deal with him and the Bloody Executioners both. By bringing them to the negotiating table, we have played our part."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_ALPHINAUD_000_000","I thought myself the hunter, but it turns out I was the prey... A timely reminder that the pirate powers of Limsa Lominsa are not to be trifled with."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_ALPHINAUD_000_001","But all's well that ends well. G'raha Tia's timely provocation had the desired effect, and Sicard has agreed to a meeting. Let us hurry back to Limsa Lominsa and pass on his invitation to the Admiral."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_ALPHINAUD_000_005","Sicard does not want for confidence, that much is plain, but I have faith in the Admiral. She has dealt with far worse."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_ALISAIE_000_006","The <Emphasis>Astalicia</Emphasis> is the very last place for such a meeting. The Admiral will be marching right into the coeurl's den. <sigh> I hope we don't end up regretting this..."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_GRAHATIA_000_007","While we have no assurances Sicard will be amenable to reason, there can be no compromise without discussion."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_000_008","There you are. We have eagerly awaited your return."

62,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_MERLWYB_100_012","Suffice to say, I accept Sicard's invitation. And I would have you join me as my guests."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_MERLWYB_000_012","The future of Limsa hangs upon the outcome of this meeting, and I would have the Scions present to bear witness."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_ALPHINAUD_000_020","When the discussion gave way to a duel, I feared what might unfold. Yet only a fool would underestimate the Admiral─as Sicard soon discovered."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_ALISAIE_000_021","While I don't condone what Sicard has been doing, I know how difficult it can be to change course. It took me long enough to join the Scions, didn't it."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_GRAHATIA_000_022","There are times when one must stand one's ground, even if the cost of failure is beyond reckoning."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_GRAHATIA_100_022","The Admiral did just that, and I have nothing but respect for her. As she continues to steer her nation through this period of transition, I pray the Navigator will see fit to fill her sails."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN_000_023","Like Mistbeard before him, Hyllfyr chose to trust the future of our nation to the Admiral. That was the moment, I believe, that the good ship Limsa Lominsa finally embarked upon her new course."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_MERLWYB_000_030","...Though I had anticipated a duel, I did not foresee that Hyllfyr would intervene."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_MERLWYB_000_031","But full glad am I that he did. 'Twould have been a shame to kill the boy."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMJ108_04014_MERLWYB_000_032","Instead, the whelp has learned a valuable lesson, and we have made peace amongst ourselves. All that remains is to do likewise with our neighbors."
