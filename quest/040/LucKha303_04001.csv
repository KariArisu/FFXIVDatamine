After your acquaintances Handeloup and Emmanellain express their eagerness to take part in the event, none other than Lord Francel arrives. Genuinely surprised and deeply touched by the gesture, he states that it would be an honor to perform with you. Make whatever final preparations you must, then join your friends atop the stage."

In celebration of the Firmament's rebirth─and as but a small token of our appreciation for your efforts in leading the restoration─we would announce the establishment of the Risensong Players, the Holy See's first official musical troupe."

68,"TEXT_LUCKHA303_04001_EMMANELLAIN_000_025","And so here you go. Have yourself a copy of the score in hand and take your place at the piano with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here, where you belong."
