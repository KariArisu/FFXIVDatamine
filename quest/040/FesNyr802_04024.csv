84,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_SUNDHIMAL_000_050","Worry not. I shall see to it that all is well between them soon enough. I would not be much of a Yellowjacket if I were unable to solve a little scuffle such as this, after all!"

89,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_063","A most delectable treat indeed. Ah, how I enjoyed feasting on them with Tenzen at my side."
90,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_064","Though, it was not always pleasant. Even now I vividly recall the time Genbu found one such treat lodged in his throat, or when Seiryu thought to swallow one whole, burning his mouth, and all the while Suzaku clamored for Tenzen to come and help them."
91,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_065","But enough reminiscing, you must be wondering why I have come all this way. Given the beast chosen as this year's herald, it piqued my interest to hear the onmyoji would be traveling here to perform their holy rites."
92,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_066","What they summon are merely shades, but they are made in my image. As such, I felt compelled to ensure no harm came to the people of these lands."
93,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_067","The tale itself is little more than fancy, of course, but I was surprised to learn you of all people were chosen to play Tenzen."
94,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_068","If I may be honest, their failure to faithfully depict those past events vexes me at times, but that is neither here nor there..."
95,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_069","It is a lasting reminder of our hard-won victory over Koryu, and the peace restored to the Far East. Viewed thus, I can see no reason to be unduly harsh in my criticism."
96,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_070","It is comfort enough that we and the other Four Lords shall always remember the truth of Tenzen's life."
97,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_072","Speaking of the others, I beg you keep my visit here between us. Should Suzaku and Seiryu learn that I had the singular good fortune of seeing you perform as Tenzen, well... I would rather not think on it."
98,"TEXT_FESNYR802_04024_BYAKKO_000_071","And with that, I shall bid you farewell. I pray you continue to carry on Tenzen's legacy, as I know only you can."
