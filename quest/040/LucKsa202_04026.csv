1,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_SEQ_01","Mikoto is convinced that Misija has exhausted the power of Save the Queen, and her vision of the near future suggests both Misija and Save the Queen can be taken into custody without bloodshed. Marsak readies their soldiers and sets out for ruins on the eastern edge of the southern front in the hopes of catching Misija unawares."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_SEQ_02","Events play out exactly as Mikoto foresaw. The Resistance manages to corner Misija who is unable to summon Queen Gunnhildr to battle. What Mikoto failed to see, however, is that this was all according to Misija's plan, for she too can now peer into the future. Imperial enforcements soon arrive, and a terrible battle ensues there in the ruins."
3,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_SEQ_03","No sooner do you bring low Misija's imperial soldiers than more arrive to take their place. But your battle was only meant to stall for time, as they manage to open a door leading deeper into the ruins, prompting Misija and Gunnhildr's Blades to escape into the shadows. You follow her into the heart of Delubrum Reginae, where you hope to put an end to her schemes and retrieve Save the Queen. "
4,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_SEQ_04","Deep within the heart of the ruins, Misija at last finds what she was searching for─a massive crystal rife with the aether needed to summon the full might of Save the Queen. Yet for all its power, the ancient blade proves no match for you. With the day won at last, you take the now-dormant Bozjan relic and an unconscious Misija back to Gangos."
5,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_SEQ_05","Misija has been placed in solitary confinement awaiting trial, and Bajsaljen believes it best if Save the Queen remain in Mikoto's care for the time being. But there will be no reprieve to study its inner workings, for an imperial warship can be seen approaching in the distance. Bajsaljen orders everyone to withdraw to Gangos and prepare to make a stand."
6,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_SEQ_06","When the Resistance next steps onto the battlefield, they will be joined by their allies from the Far East. Considering all that is at stake, there is no question that your strength will be needed when that day comes."

51,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_MARSHAK_000_003","Yes, and with good reason. With no means of combating such a foe, our troops have barely set foot outside of our encampments."
52,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_MIKOTO_000_004","I believe that Misija has her own reasons for making only sporadic appearances. She must use the crystal focus to conjure Queen Gunnhildr, and therein lies the rub, for its reserves of aether are not without limitation."
53,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_BAISHAEN_000_005","Then perhaps she fears the crystal focus nears exhaustion. But what prevents her from simply restoring its aether and resuming her assault?"
54,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_LILJA_000_006","Well, it just so happens the crystal focus requires aether of a very specific sort. We were only able to find one source, and that's still depleted from when we used it."
55,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_MIKOTO_000_007","Before we returned, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and I chanced to spy Misija commanding Queen Gunnhildr to enslave a group of soldiers, but the apparition vanished after turning only one of them. I suspect the crystal lacked the energies necessary to complete the task."
56,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_GEROLT_000_008","That's all well an' good, lass, but Misija ain't no fool. Until she figures out how to get the crystal focus workin' again, she won't be showin' her face again."
57,"TEXT_LUCKSA202_04026_MIKOTO_000_009","She will. At least...I think she will. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and I shared another vision of the future."
