Gerolt is confident that fifteen relics should suffice for your plans, and so you set out in search of dark, perilous ruins, hoping his guess is on the mark.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.
※Timeworn artifacts can be obtained by completing the raid Delubrum Reginae, or the deep dungeon Palace of the Dead."

Loaded into the Allagan node, along with the Resistance weapon, the refinement process thereafter is surprisingly painless. Almost suspiciously so. Zlatan and Gerolt then discuss the feasibility of repeating the refinement process, prompting an equally suspicious recording from the Allagan node, extolling wares from the House of Splendors that would save you the trouble of finding more artifacts, albeit at a price. Zlatan would not forbid you from purchasing from the House of Splendors, but he is understandably keen to avoid any unnecessary dealings with the notoriously unscrupulous Rowena."
