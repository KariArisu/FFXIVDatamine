1,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_01","For your first lesson as a sage, Lalah introduces you to the sage's arms, the hovering nouliths. Yet eager though she is to have you try your hand at using them, your mission calls you to Idyllshire in the Dravanian hinterlands, where the fugitives have reportedly made their way."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_02","Upon arriving in Idyllshire, Lalah suggests splitting up to search for your elusive quarry. While she sees to the town's south, you turn your steps for the north."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_03","As you scan your surrounds, you chance to hear a cry for help. Together with Lalah, you rush towards the disturbance to find a man at the mercy of three assailants. Your intervention prompts the villains─a Viera man named Loifa and his two accomplices─to leave, and you turn to render aid to their intended victim."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_04","The man introduces himself as Faldrinet, and to Lalah's surprise, he is not only a fellow Sharlayan, but a sage besides─a traveling healer who offers his services gratis to those in need. Though he does not know why he was attacked, he theorizes that his assailants, whom Lalah is confident are the fugitives, wish to obtain forbidden plants that still grow at Saint Mocianne's Arboretum."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_05","Seeing the logic in Faldrinet's supposition, Lalah decides to investigate the arboretum. The fugitives, she posits, have enhanced themselves with sage magic, and she makes no attempt to hide her disdain for their misuse of the art before setting off for the abandoned facility."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_06","You join Lalah at the arboretum, where your objective is to find the fugitives, and failing that, clues that will lead you to them. Rife with unruly flora and fauna, the place promises to provide you with good practice for your budding sage's skills, and you steel yourself for the foray."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_07","Your preparations complete, you venture into Saint Mocianne's Arboretum and begin searching for the fugitives."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_08","You make your way through the arboretum, and after coming upon signs of their passage, finally encounter Loifa and his accomplices, Mahaud and Ancel. A clash ensues, which ends when they decide it is not in their best interest to fight, and they teleport away─but not before dropping a peculiar pouch."
9,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_09","Outside the arboretum, Lalah reveals that the pouch held an unknown plant. Furthermore, she chanced upon a diary which appears to belong to a Sharlayan sage. Though the fugitives and their objective still elude you, you have these clues to show for your efforts, and head back to Idyllshire to take stock."
10,"TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_10","Lalah informs you that she has dispatched the mystery herb to her homeland for identification. While awaiting the results, she bids you take the opportunity to continue honing your skills as a sage.

※The next sage quest will be available from Lalah Jinjahl upon reaching level 73."
