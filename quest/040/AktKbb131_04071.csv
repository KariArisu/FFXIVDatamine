1,"TEXT_AKTKBB131_04071_SEQ_01","Lalah informs you that her superiors have decided to spare no resources in the hunt for Guildivain─a remarkable-yet-welcome change of policy given their earlier dismissal of the rumors concerning his crimes. While awaiting further developments, she asks that you continue your training by lending a helping hand to the locals. Restless, Loifa offers to accompany you, and Lalah gives her blessing, seeing it as an opportunity for you to learn from a fellow sage. Together you seek out Midnight Dew to inquire after treasure hunters who may be in need of assistance."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBB131_04071_SEQ_02","According to Midnight Dew, some treasure hunters have yet to return. You duly volunteer to search for them in her stead, mindful of her warning that especially nasty fiends have appeared in the area of late."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBB131_04071_SEQ_03","You come upon a fiend trying to make a meal of a hunter, and strike it down under Loifa's watchful eye. With the danger passed, you turn your attention to the hunter's wounds."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBB131_04071_SEQ_04","You use your sage magic to heal the hunter, who thanks you profusely for your aid. After she leaves, Loifa expresses his gladness at having helped her, and you resume your search for hunters in distress."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBB131_04071_SEQ_05","You soon come upon another hunter being attacked by fierce wildlife. You promptly dispatch the creatures, but the man appears to be near death and possibly beyond your ability to save, if the look in Loifa's eye is any indication..."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBB131_04071_SEQ_06","Given the seriousness of the hunter's wound, Loifa decides it is no time for training, and personally renders aid. Once back on his feet, the man offers Loifa his heartfelt gratitude─an act which spurs the young Viera to reflect upon his sage's power. Before meeting you and Lalah, he had no purpose for it except revenge. But having come to realize that Lalah's mother saw in him the potential to become a saver of lives, he swears to use his power only to protect his friends. Satisfied with your efforts, the two of you make your way back to Idyllshire to rejoin Lalah."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBB131_04071_SEQ_07","The hunt for Guildivain has been productive; with the aid of a fellow operative, Lalah has identified a cave in the Dravanian forelands as the villain's base of operations. Additionally, you have learned that the death of Guildivain's wife may have triggered his descent into madness. Yet whether or not he is to be pitied, the man cannot be permitted to continue his depraved experiments. In preparation for the impending confrontation, Lalah reveals that she is working on a countermeasure, and asks for your patience and faith until such time as all is in readiness.

※The next sage quest will be available from Lalah Jinjahl upon reaching level 80."
