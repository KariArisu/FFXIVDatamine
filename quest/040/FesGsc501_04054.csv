※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESGSC501_04054_SEQ_01","Ollier shares with you his plight. As the Gold Saucer attendant tells it, a robbery has taken place, and one of his closest friends and colleagues has been unfairly named the primary suspect. Feeling pity for the man, you agree to accompany him to the Manderville Lounge, that he might fill you in on the details.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESGSC501_04054_SEQ_02","At the lounge, Ollier apprises you of the specifics regarding the incident at hand. It would seem his friend, a man named Hugue, has come under suspicion primarily for his proximity to the scene of the crime, as well as a blemish on his record from when he committed an act of petty theft some years ago. Ollier, however, remains convinced that the true culprit is to be found elsewhere. Swayed by his words─and with the blessing of Master Roland─you agree to conduct an investigation of your own in hopes of getting at the truth of the matter."
3,"TEXT_FESGSC501_04054_SEQ_03","To expedite your investigation, Ollier presents you with a journal which might be used to record any testimony you may hear─or observations you might make─in your survey of the crime scene and the surrounding areas. He then suggests that you might begin your effort by speaking to a nearby attendant who, at a glance, appears visibly apprehensive about something or other."
4,"TEXT_FESGSC501_04054_SEQ_04","You question the attendant, who you learn was manning the Mini Cactpot counter at the time of the crime. The man insists that he saw no suspicious personages behind the counter, and is therefore confused and dismayed as to how this dastardly crime could have been carried out. Recording the attendant's words in your journal, you set off to speak once more with Ollier, more determined than ever to get to the bottom of this mystery."
5,"TEXT_FESGSC501_04054_SEQ_05","Pleased to see that his journal is serving you well, Ollier encourages you to scour the Saucer high and low, talking to as many people as you can, and leaving no Triple Triad table unturned in your search for clues that might shed light on the mystery. When you feel you have gathered all the information out there to be gleaned, speak with the man again that you might share with him any deductions you have made."
6,"TEXT_FESGSC501_04054_SEQ_06","Armed with your trusty journal and the observations recorded in its pages, you share your deductions before a tribunal headed by Master Roland. After a series of arguments, objections, and considerable deliberation, a verdict is rendered, and the case at long last comes to a conclusion. Speak with Ollier again, that you might hear his thoughts on this turn of events."
7,"TEXT_FESGSC501_04054_SEQ_07","Ollier shares with you his impressions on all that has transpired, and thanks you once more for your efforts on his dear friend's behalf. He further explains that he would present you with a more tangible gift as a token of his gratitude, and bids you collect it from one of his colleagues."

71,"TEXT_FESGSC501_04054_OLLIER_000_032","My friend swears he is innocent, of course, and a more honest man I have never known. Yet, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary─or any leads suggesting another possibility─the Brass Blades have all but assumed that he is the culprit."
