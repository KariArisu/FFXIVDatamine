1,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_SEQ_01","Resistance scouts have confirmed the IVth Legion has abandoned Castrum Lacus Litore, and are now consolidating their forces at Zadnor. Despite the presence of the imperial fleet, Bajsaljen intends to confront the enemy, with Camp Vrdelnis as the staging ground."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_SEQ_02","As per Marsak's instructions, you speak with Sjeros, who is to act as your escort to Zadnor."
3,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_SEQ_03","Thanks to the Ironworks' ingenuity and contributions from the Dalmascan resistance, Cid was able to erect a barrier to protect Camp Vrdelnis from aerial assaults. Bajsaljen has a mind to push the front line forward, however, and any outposts established hereafter will also require similar protection. Thankfully, the Ironworks already has a plan of action, which Lilja is eager to explain."
4,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_SEQ_04","The Resistance seeks to secure new outposts closer to the imperials' base of operations, but to do so will require further barriers and a sufficient source of energy to power them. To that end, Cid and Lilja ask you to place devices in the field to redirect the flow of aether towards the proposed outposts."
5,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_SEQ_05","Using the Ironworks' latest creation, the Resistance should be able to obtain all the power they need to maintain a barrier surrounding each outpost, assuming, of course, the devices actually work. You steel yourself for yet another foray into the battlefield, that you may carve the first foothold in enemy territory."

We have at last determined the whereabouts of the IVth Legion's remaining installation here in Bozja. Our scouts reported sightings of their forces rallying at Zadnor to the north, which seems to indicate that Castrum Lacus Litore has been abandoned."
49,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_MARSHAK_000_001","We deployed our vanguard to advance on the enemy stronghold, but the way is barred by a fleet of warships."

51,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_MARSHAK_000_003","Our first port of call is Camp Vrdelnis. When you are ready, Sjeros will escort you there."

53,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_SYSTEM_000_030","You now have access to Zadnor. Like the Bozjan southern front, Zadnor can be explored in parties of up to eight players, or solo."

56,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_100","Thank you for coming. I understand this is your first time in Zadnor, yes? Even before the IVth Legion relocated here from Castrum Lacus Litore, it was hardly the most hospitable of places."
57,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_101","To see it now, one can scarcely believe it was once a rich and fertile land. Sadly, it was not spared the ravages of the Fourth Umbral Calamity."
58,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_102","In the wake of the disaster, this plateau became rich in earth-aspected crystals. Miners were keen to seize the opportunity, and they quickly exhausted the supply of this valuable resource. As the settlers had no other reason to continue living in such harsh environs, the region eventually became uninhabited."
59,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_103","Until the imperials decided to establish an outpost here, that is. Just when we thought ourselves prepared for their next assault, they usher in a fleet of ships from Dalmasca led by the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis>. It has yet to move since dropping anchor."
60,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_104","There is no denying the strategical advantage of their present location, but we are not yet convinced it is fit to serve as a new base of operations."
61,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_105","Regardless, rather than speculate over the imperials' schemes, we must take decisive action. Now is the time to deliver the final blow to the IVth Legion."
62,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_106","If we are to succeed, we will first need to deal with the warships stymieing our attempts to advance."
63,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_107","(-Familiar Voice-)Well, it's a good thing you have us to help with that."
64,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_108","See those floating rock formations? One might think them a result of the Fourth Umbral Calamity, but they were actually caused by the Bozja incident."
65,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_109","When Dalamud struck the citadel, vast quantities of energy permeated the site, likely carried to every corner of Bozja via aether currents. Certain regions were affected more severely than others, and, well...the results are self-explanatory."
66,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_110","Thankfully, we've managed to tap into that energy to erect a barrier to protect from aerial strikes, much like Seiryu's Wall."
67,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_130","As you can see, the barrier only extends to the boundaries of this encampment, but it should keep us safe for the time being. Words can ill express my gratitude to Cid for all he has done for us."
68,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_131","I can't take all the credit. This wouldn't have been possible without the equipment supplied to us by the Dalmascan resistance."
69,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_132","What's more, the idea to use the land's residual energy came from Lilja, one of my newest engineers. So you see, it was a collaborative effort."
70,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_133","But as you said, the barrier can only cover so much ground. If the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis> decides to do more than loom ominously in the distance, our troops on the front line won't stand a chance."
71,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BWAGI_000_134","If only it were a matter of combating their fleet with one of our own. As things stand, the Eastern alliance is in no position to lend us any of their ships, and the Bozjans have next to none in the first place."
72,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_LILJA_000_135","We may not have a fleet, but we <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> have an abundance of residual aether at our disposal."

74,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_136","And pray tell, where might we find one of those?"
75,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_137","Yes, yes, point taken. After all, I can't have newcomers like you stealing my thunder. I'll see if I can turn that idea of yours into a workable solution."
76,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_138","We would be lost without the aid of Garlond Ironworks and the Eastern alliance. Their goodwill must be repaid with naught less than victory."
77,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_LILJA_000_180","Now that you're here, we've a favor to ask of you. I volunteered to do it myself, but a certain someone insisted I stay put."
78,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_181","Your enthusiasm is appreciated, but I'd rather go myself than put any of my workers in harm's way. Besides, this is no job for an engineer. Long story short─the Resistance means to advance on the enemy's position, and to do that, they'll need protection."
79,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_182","We aim to erect additional barriers at each outpost they establish along the route to the IVth Legion's base of operations. The trouble is, the residual aether alone may not be enough, so we plan to divert the currents further afield."
80,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_LILJA_000_183","Although the theory is sound enough, we haven't had a chance to put it into practice."
81,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_184","This is where we were hoping you might be able to help. We need you to take this prototype device and activate it at a specific location."

83,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_A1_000_100","And that location would be in the middle of the battlefield, correct?"

86,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_LILJA_000_195","I know you're only joking, but please don't say such things. I couldn't bear the thought of someone thinking you actually meant that."
87,"TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_MIKOTO_000_200","While the technology involved differs somewhat, in terms of what you actually have to do, it is more or less the same as the task you performed on the southern front."
