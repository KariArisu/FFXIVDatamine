1,"TEXT_LUCKMJ110_04016_SEQ_01","Just as you are about to return to the Rising Stones, a breathless Maelstrom officer rushes up and begs the Admiral to follow him. He duly leads you to the cliffs opposite the Floating City of Nym, where you espy a strange tower which─he claims─was not there when he began his daily patrol. But it is only when the Admiral subsequently receives a linkpearl communication from Maelstrom headquarters that the scale of the problem becomes clear. It seems that many more such structures─apparently of Garlean design─have materialized across the realm. Anticipating trouble, Merlwyb bids you join the Alliance forces on the eastern front, and you set forth for the Ala Mhigan Quarter to offer Commander Hext your support."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMJ110_04016_SEQ_02","Lyse has scarcely finished welcoming you when an enormous dragon passes overhead, seemingly bound for the palace. Giving chase, you emerge in the Royal Menagerie, where you come face-to-face with Asahi...or rather an Ascian in his body. With a self-indulgent flourish, your foe introduces himself as Fandaniel, and declares his intent to destroy the world in a recreation of the Final Days, in which the towers will play some unspecified part. When you move to apprehend him, his dragon─the so-called “Lunar Bahamut”─sets the rooftop garden ablaze, allowing the Ascian to take his leave─but not before informing you that his patron, Lord Zenos, awaits you at the heart of the chaos..."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMJ110_04016_SEQ_03","The mood is subdued as you reassemble before the Royal Palace. With little information upon which to act, Lyse proposes sending a unit to investigate the nearby tower, and at Raubahn's insistence, you decide to return to the Rising Stones to recuperate while awaiting further developments."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMJ110_04016_SEQ_04","You arrive at the Rising Stones to find Y'shtola returned, and exchange news of your recent endeavors. It seems that after recovering her strength, Y'shtola delivered the first litter of porxies to the Immortal Flames in Ul'dah, while Krile investigated reports that towers had been sighted not only across Eorzea, but in Yanxia in the Far East. When thoughts subsequently turn to the new draconic foe you face in Lunar Bahamut, Krile and Tataru declare their intention to seek the aid of Estinien, leaving you and the others to take what rest you can. Though it feels like your efforts to bring lasting peace to Eorzea have been overshadowed, you know that the future of the star is yet unwritten, and that you and your comrades will stop at nothing to protect it."

81,"TEXT_LUCKMJ110_04016_ALPHINAUD_000_051","Unhinged, perhaps, but no fool. For all his pantomime theatrics, he gave away little about his plot. We know only that he intends to recreate the Final Days, and that the towers will somehow facilitate this."

85,"TEXT_LUCKMJ110_04016_GRAHATIA_000_055","That may be...but the fact that it answered to Fandaniel would suggest they are not one and the same entity. I think it more probable that it is some manner of simulacrum born of Ascian magicks."

88,"TEXT_LUCKMJ110_04016_YSHTOLA_000_058","I have been to see the sultana. Knowing how quick the Immortal Flames are to dispose of their tempered, I judged it best to provide them with the cure first."
