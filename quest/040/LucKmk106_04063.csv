1,"TEXT_LUCKMK106_04063_SEQ_01","Upon disembarking at the airship landing, you are met by Nanamo, who reveals that one of your friends has been gravely wounded. Realizing at once that she must mean Arenvald, Alphinaud departs for the Phrontistery in visible distress, prompting Alisaie to suggest that you and Estinien go after him."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMK106_04063_SEQ_02","At the Phrontistery, you are told that the chirurgeons have done all they can for your comrade, but that his fate yet hangs in the balance. When Alphinaud subsequently thanks Fordola for bringing Arenvald back, she lashes out at him, condemning his idealism as naivety. At this, Estinien interjects that those who uphold such ideals are the ones remembered as heroes. Alas, his words seem to fall on deaf ears."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMK106_04063_SEQ_03","At the sultana's invitation, you join the rest of the Scions in the Fragrant Chamber, hoping to hear the findings of Arenvald and Fordola's ill-fated mission. You duly learn that a creature resembling Ifrit was waiting for them inside the tower, and that further such entities have been sighted in the vicinity of other towers across the realm. Anticipating your response to these grim tidings, Nanamo assures you that the Grand Companies are ready to deal with the threat, and bids you take the opportunity to recuperate from your recent exertions."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMK106_04063_SEQ_04","Outside the Fragrant Chamber, Thancred notifies those stationed at the Rising Stones by linkpearl that your party will soon be returning. In the ensuing conversation, he learns that Krile has several matters she wishes to discuss, one of them involving Estinien."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMK106_04063_SEQ_05","Scant moments after welcoming you home, Krile announces her intention to depart for Sharlayan to petition the Forum's aid in uncovering the Telophoroi's true motives; a proposal which raises eyebrows among her fellow Archons, but one to which they ultimately acquiesce. The surprises do not end there, however. Krile also reveals that the investigation she recently conducted alongside Y'shtola concerned the apparent lack of communication between Hydaelyn and Her chosen champion─you. This, she declares, is another question to which she hopes to find answers during her trip. Acknowledging that her departure will leave the Scions a member short, however, she turns at last to Estinien, and invites him once more to join the cause. And, perhaps most surprisingly of all, he accepts."
6,"TEXT_LUCKMK106_04063_SEQ_06","With Lunar Bahamut slain, and the Scions' ranks bolstered by the presence of a singularly capable new member, now would seem the perfect time to rest and take stock. Though Fandaniel and the Telophoroi remain a threat, you may be sure that Tataru will call upon you when the time comes to face them again."

51,"TEXT_LUCKMK106_04063_YSHTOLA_000_015","To see the Amalj'aa fighting alongside us brought to mind the Zun we encountered in the Crystarium. I pray that our peoples can forge bonds as strong as those of our counterparts in the First."
