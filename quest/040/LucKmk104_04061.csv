2,"TEXT_LUCKMK104_04061_SEQ_02","After overcoming certain technical hurdles, you are finally in a position to release Tiamat's shackles, though Alphinaud will be required to stay on the Flagship in order to operate the terminal.

While she is thus engaged, G'raha Tia suggests that you ask the great wyrm to recount tales of her life prior to Bahamut's summoning, hopeful that it might help her to recall her true self. This you duly do, and─whether because of your attempts at conversation or in spite of them─the first round of treatment appears to go well."

No sooner has she done so, however, than you receive a linkpearl communication from Urianger, who informs you that <Emphasis>Lunar</Emphasis> Bahamut has been sighted leading a host─including dragons─in the direction of Paglth'an. Determined to atone for past sins, Tiamat immediately takes to the sky with Estinien on her back, leaving the rest of you to formulate a plan of your own."
