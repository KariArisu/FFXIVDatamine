0,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEQ_00","Kipih Jakkya is looking around in consternation.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEQ_01","Kipih Jakkya, reporter for Gridanian tabloid <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>, shares with you the details of her latest potential scoop. It would seem she is hot on the trail of some mysterious figure responsible for buying up a suspicious quantity of Nymeia lilies, but needs someone familiar with Ul'dah to assist in her investigations. Perhaps the notables of the Quicksand can aid in your inquiries.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEQ_02","Mistress Momodi herself fields your questions, the description you provide reminding her of a request made by the infamous “wandering minstrel” involving the transport of a sizable cargo to the Alchemists' Guild. Although conceding the similarities may be mere coincidence, you nevertheless decide to pay a visit to Guildmaster Severian."
3,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEQ_03","The self-absorbed Severian almost dismisses you out of hand, but at the last moment recalls a task to process a vast quantity of floral material. His brief flicker of interest in the subject soon extinguished, the guildmaster directs you to speak with the guild's steadfast receptionist, Deitrich, for the details."
4,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEQ_04","Without revealing the nature of the finished product, Deitrich explains that the fruits of their labor are to be distributed amongst the populace over the course of the Rising. If Kipih would learn more, it seems there is no recourse left but to accost the minstrel himself. It is time to return to the Quicksand."
5,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEQ_05","After digesting the information you brought back from the Alchemists' Guild, Kipih agrees that an “on the spot” interview is in order. According to the Quicksand's clientele, the minstrel should be preparing to put on a performance in the vicinity of the Ruby Road Exchange."
6,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEQ_06","The wandering minstrel welcomes your questions, relieved to hear that his surprise was not inadvertently spoiled. On the contrary, rather than turn you away, the nomadic musician insists that you participate in his plan to distribute bundles of custom-made potpourri to the masses. Kipih suggests that the two of you return to the Quicksand, whence news of your aromatic offerings should reach a wide and varied audience."
7,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEQ_07","You finish handing out your bundles of calming potpourri, warmed by the knowledge that your efforts will help soothe hearts yet suffering from the violence of the Calamity. Return to the wandering minstrel at the Ruby Road Exchange and report the completion of your task."
8,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEQ_08","You locate the itinerant bard, and Kipih is moved to share her own memories of the Calamity. The exchange inspires the minstrel, who composes a verse dedicated to the continued safe passage of those who yet ascend the path out of catastrophe and despair. Without warning, you are transported beyond the boundaries of time and space, to meet and speak with the enigmatic Naoki Yoshida. Upon your return to “reality,” the minstrel favors you with yet another composition, compounding his wishes that you─indeed, all who seek to survive in this world─are afforded the smoothest road possible for the journey still to come."

67,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_MOMODI_000_023","Hmmm. We've more than our fair share of traders comin' and goin', and a large shipment arrivin' in the city is hardly a noteworthy occurrence."

83,"TEXT_FESANV701_04091_SEVERIAN_000_045","'Tis laughable that I would undertake such a menial chore, of course, so I assigned the task to my subordinates. If you wish to discuss the tedious details, Deitrich is your man."
