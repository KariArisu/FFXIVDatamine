50,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_001","To make matters worse, its rather awkward location requires us to redirect multiple currents to sustain a sufficient flow of energy."
51,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_LILJA_000_002","That's where these beauties come in─the defluxion aether manipulators, Mark II and Mark III! What sets them apart from the first model, you may ask...? Well, apart from the name, not a lot, but they <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> newer, if that counts for anything!"

55,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_025","(-Mikoto-)Excellent. Proceed to the next site, and stay vigilant─there is no telling when you may encounter imperial forces."
56,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_030","(-Mikoto-)Excellent. Return to the outpost and we shall handle the rest."

62,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_071","Now it is up to the Resistance to drive away the imperials. Once they have, a substantial confluence of energy should be available to power a new barrier."
63,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_LILJA_000_072","Well, everything seems to be under control here, so I'd better get going."
64,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_LILJA_000_073","Oh, right. Mikoto's gathered some promising data to help the chief deal with the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis>."
65,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_074","It pertains to my findings on the inner workings of the crystal foci. I believe it may be of use to him."
66,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_LILJA_000_075","The chief said he'd be heading back to Doma after finishing maintenance on Seiryu's Wall. Rather than drag him all the way back here, it seems quicker if I take the data to him myself. But don't worry─I'll be back before you know it."
67,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_LILJA_000_076","Ah, before I go... Mikoto. Is there anything else you'd like me to pass on to Cid?"
68,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_LILJA_000_077","It's not good to keep your emotions bottled up like that, you know. Why don't you tell him how you feel?"
69,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_078","How I f─ <gasp> Lilja! That is wholly and utterly unprofessional! I-I would never... <Emphasis>He</Emphasis> would never! And even if we did, we...
This is neither the time nor the place to discuss such matters!"
70,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_LILJA_000_079","I think it is. I've seen far too many people live to regret words left unspoken."
71,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_LILJA_000_080","Just think on it, will you? And try not to miss me while I'm away!"
72,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_081","Um... Is there any chance you could forget that entire conversation?"
73,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_082","I was only joking, but thank you for trying!"
74,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_083","To tell the truth, since entering the Studium, my life has had but one singular purpose─the pursuit of knowledge. Yet for all my research and scholarly works, I never learned what it truly means to live."
75,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_084","At least, that is what Moenbryda would tell me. She would often admonish me, always insisting I spend time with the other students, or at the very least step away from my dusty tomes for some fresh air."
76,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_085","Perhaps she hoped I might find someone I cherished more than my books, though sadly she never had the chance to see it."
77,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_086","Cid is truly a remarkable man, and I'll not deny our shared interest in the sciences. During the short time we've worked together, we've become good friends."
78,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_087","And as his friend, I understand the great burdens of his mind. Even now, he struggles to break free from his ties to the Empire and his father's terrible legacy..."
79,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_088","Which is why I wish to do all within my power to support him. As a friend, mind you. My feelings toward Cid are similar to those I felt for Moenbryda─respect and admiration."
80,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_089","As much as I hate to disappoint Lilja, that is the way of things. So please, don't read too deeply into it."
81,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_090","M-Master Gerolt! What are you doing here?"
82,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_GEROLT_000_091","Better question'd be what are <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> doin' here? Should be you payin' the visit to Cid in Doma."
83,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_GEROLT_000_092","Nothin' to be embarrassed about, lass. All romances have to start somewhere, and I agree the two o' ye make a good match."
84,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_GEROLT_000_093","But you need to act quick. Even <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> can see the man's a fine glass of ale, and I reckon it won't be long afore some pretty thing snatches him up to take a swig."
85,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_RIAN_000_100","Well? Is it ready?"
86,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MENENIUS_000_101","The modifications will require more time."
87,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_RIAN_000_102","You can't be serious! It's been ages since the damn thing was excavated. Have the engineers been sitting around with their thumbs up their arses all this time!?"
88,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MENENIUS_000_103","Far from it. Given that this is unexplored territory, we must proceed with caution."
89,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_RIAN_000_104","Tell that to the Resistance soldiers a stone's throw from our bloody front door. It won't be long before they tear it down."
90,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_RIAN_000_105","Why not withdraw to Dalmasca? Surely they can finish their modifications on the way back?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MENENIUS_000_106","Withdraw? You would abandon everything we have labored for here in Bozja? And that is not all we stand to lose... Surely, you have not forgotten the events of Castrum Meridianum?"
92,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_RIAN_000_107","I only know what I've heard, that Gaius's pet ended up biting the hand that fed it before turning the place upside down."
93,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MENENIUS_000_108","Not quite the wording used in the reports, but accurate enough... Knowing his plans would soon be thwarted, he deployed an anti-eikon warmachina in a final attempt to drive back the Eorzean forces. He could not contain its power, and because of his hubris, the castrum was wiped off the map."
94,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MENENIUS_000_109","In short, the relics of the Allagans are not to be trifled with. It takes but one mistake for our plans to fall to ruin."
95,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_RIAN_000_110","And yet Sicinius has seen fit to scurry off to some far-flung hole when he's needed most. This was <Emphasis>his</Emphasis> scheme, not ours. He should be the one overseeing all this."
96,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MENENIUS_000_111","...Perhaps you should put this pent-up frustration of yours to use outside. After all, in light of Misija's recent failure, it now falls to us to rout the Resistance."
97,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_RIAN_000_112","Really? You're <Emphasis>asking</Emphasis> me to go out there? Hah, it's about damn time!"
98,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MENENIUS_000_113","Hmph. Somehow I knew you would relish the opportunity to get your hands dirty."
99,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_RIAN_000_114","Oh, I assure you they'll be absolutely filthy by the time I return."
100,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_130","It seems the Resistance already has their sights set on another potential outpost site. I can only hope they secure the location without heavy losses."
101,"TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_SYSTEM_000_140","The next quest can be accepted by speaking with Dmitar after reaching Resistance rank <Value>IntegerParameter(1)</Value> or higher."
