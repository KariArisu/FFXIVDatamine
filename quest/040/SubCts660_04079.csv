78,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_050","I believe you are acquainted with her, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. She is the one who fell from the Vault and was saved by a white dragon."
79,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_051","Truth be told, she is too young for the work. But seeing her enthusiasm, I am minded to give her a chance."

95,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_093","Now then, I requested your presence for no other reason than to ask you a question: why do you wish to work here?"
96,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAELIE_000_094","Well, ever since <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Vidofnir helped me, I've wanted to be someone who can help others."

98,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_095","That is a wonderful desire. But know that to work at the infirmary is to be responsible for no less than the lives of others. There will be trying times, but come what may, you cannot forsake your duty."
99,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_096","For instance, there may be patients who judge you not less, but more harshly, on account of your being a child. But you cannot allow yourself to be discouraged."
100,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_097","And at a bare minimum, you will be expected to know your letters and numbers, for lives could well depend on it. Do you think you will be equal to the task?"

102,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_099","And you, Charlemend. I feel obliged to point out that many of our patients are commoners who once served nobles as soldiers."
103,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_100","When they discover your identity, there are those who may assume the worst of you. That you are, for instance─and forgive me my bluntness─an eccentric nobleman indulging a whim. They may not speak their minds, but their conduct towards you will be more than telling."
104,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_101","In the face of such disdain, do you think you will be able to perform your duties?"
105,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_CHARLEMEND_000_102","I offer my services in the full awareness that some may not take kindly to my presence. Regardless of how I am treated, I am determined to perform my duties to the best of my ability."
106,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_CHARLEMEND_000_103","Be that as it may, I confess I do not always know how best to relate to the commonfolk. And I fear it may cause me to struggle to win the patients' trust..."

108,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_Q2_000_001","You've won over foreign merchants. You can win over your own people."
109,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_Q2_000_002","It may not be easy, but I have faith in you."
110,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_CHARLEMEND_000_104","Rest assured none of this deters me from my course. If there is one thing I have learned, it is that <Emphasis>anyone</Emphasis> can learn─so long as they are willing. And for a blessing, I am in the presence of an ideal teacher."
111,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_CHARLEMEND_000_105","If you would be so kind as to teach me about your world, child, I would be glad to tutor you in letters and numbers."
112,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_CHARLEMEND_000_106","As individuals, we may have shortcomings, but together we can overcome them to better serve the needs of those in our care."

115,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_MAURILETTE_000_109","Now, without further ado, I shall assign you your first task. Our stores of daily necessities are dwindling, and I would like you to replenish them. As we have no regular supplier at this time, you may procure the items from wherever you deem fit."
116,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_CHARLEMEND_000_110","We shall set about it at once. The first step will be to seek out sources for that which we require..."

118,"TEXT_SUBCTS660_04079_CHARLEMEND_000_112","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, your skills are known far and wide. We would be most assured were you to consent to being our supplier."
