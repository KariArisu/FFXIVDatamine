1,"TEXT_LUCKHA304_04002_SEQ_01","Never ashamed to wear his feelings on his sleeve, Lord Francel appears more emotional than ever as he thanks you profusely for taking the stage with him today. Your moment of shared reverie, however, is interrupted by Thomelin, who announces the arrival of an unexpected and assumedly important visitor. Join Francel at the Mendicant's Court to see what development might await you."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHA304_04002_SEQ_02","You arrive at the Mendicant's Court to discover that your unexpected guest is none other than Ser Aymeric, who, in his own words, has been waiting for the ideal opportunity to express his thanks to Lord Francel for his selfless efforts in rebuilding and revitalizing the Firmament. The young lord, for his part, seems rightly intimidated by the sudden and unexpected praise. Speak with him and pray reassure him that this can only be a positive development."
3,"TEXT_LUCKHA304_04002_SEQ_03","Though remaining halfway in a state of shock at Ser Aymeric's sudden arrival, Lord Francel is nevertheless deeply satisfied and pleased to see his vision of the Firmament finally realized. With confidence that the current generation of Ishgard's luminaries─not to mention the people who form the living, breathing heart of the nation itself─are prepared to usher the Holy See into a new age of prosperity, you offer your most sincere thanks to your companion for his unwavering foresight and devotion to the cause, and promise that you will return in the future to further see his visions become reality."
