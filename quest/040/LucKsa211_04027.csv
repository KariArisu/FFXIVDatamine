52,"TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_001","And for that you have my sympathies, but genius is a most fickle mistress, and her expertise was thoroughly spent but recently on a playscript promised to my dear friend Jenomis."
53,"TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WAKADANNAOFMUJIKOZA_000_002","You honestly mean to say you have nothing? Not even an outline? I deserve that much after you were so generously compensated the other evening."

55,"TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WAKADANNAOFMUJIKOZA_000_004","Well it certainly wasn't offered out of the kindness of my heart. Have you any idea how expensive that wine was?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_005","As I recall, you and your wife were the ones who drank most of it. And you clearly have more money than sense, because that particular “vintage” was positively revolting."

60,"TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_009","The fabled blade Save the Queen given life, guarded by Gunnhildr's Blades... And you say this took place in the ruins of the Bozjan royal palace? My oh my, that is quite the riveting tale."
