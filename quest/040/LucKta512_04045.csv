49,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_002","Another one of those recording devices has arrived from Konogg. Seems the lad has more he wants to say to you. Here."
50,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_003","When you have a moment, be sure to see what's on it."

52,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_GLAGG_100_004","Yes, the two of you! What are you doin', talkin' and noddin' suspiciously!? What are you up to!?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_GLAGG_000_005","<gasp> You're conspirin' to take over the village, aren't you!? Just like those murderous machines!"
54,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_GLAGG_000_006","Huh? What am I...? What did I just...? Unnngh, my head..."
55,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_007","Something's not right with Glagg. And it's not quite the same sort of “not right” what follows a few too many casks of ale..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_008","Well, whatever it is, it's nothing you need to worry about. I'll take care of it."
57,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_009","Now then, was there something else you needed?"

59,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_A1_000_001","Is there anything I can help with?"

62,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_VILLAGERB03954_000_012","(-???-)Excuse me..."
63,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_013","You... What do you want? If you're here to mock us, have done with it and leave us be."
64,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_VILLAGERB03954_000_014","N-No, I'm not here to mock you. On the contrary, I want to join you."
65,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_VILLAGERB03954_000_015","I'm usually not one to get involved, preferring to observe from a safe distance while making the occasional comment to remind people of my presence. But seeing how hard you've been working for the village, I couldn't help but want to make myself useful for a change."
66,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_016","Well, we could certainly use all the help we can get... What say you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Shall we welcome him to the crew?"
67,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_VILLAGERB03954_000_017","Thank you! I'm certain you won't regret it!"
68,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_018","After that strangeness with Glagg, I wasn't sure what to expect from our dour friend, but it sure wasn't an offer of help."
69,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_019","Anyway, I'll find a moment to talk with the fellow about our plans. And when he's managed to settle in, you ought to have a word with him too."
70,"TEXT_LUCKTA512_04045_DWARFMASTER03671_000_020","But to answer your earlier question─there's nothing we need you for right now. Only a matter of time before we call on you again, though, so kick your feet up while you can."
