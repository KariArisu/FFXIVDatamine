49,"TEXT_LUCKTA515_04048_VILLAGERD03954_000_002","Um, Chief? Can I speak with you for a moment?"
50,"TEXT_LUCKTA515_04048_DWARFMASTER03671_000_003","Sure, what is it?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKTA515_04048_VILLAGERD03954_000_004","It's Glagg. I ran into him just now, and he was behaving oddly..."
52,"TEXT_LUCKTA515_04048_VILLAGERD03954_000_005","Just when you think he's angry, he suddenly bursts into tears. And the next thing you know, he's talking with you like you're an old friend."
53,"TEXT_LUCKTA515_04048_DWARFMASTER03671_000_006","Ah, that... He's been that way since the meeting."
54,"TEXT_LUCKTA515_04048_DWARFMASTER03671_000_007","But I'll sort him out, so don't worry. Thanks for bringing me word, and let me know if you notice anything else."

56,"TEXT_LUCKTA515_04048_DWARFMASTER03671_000_009","Sorry, I'm saying all of this out loud, but it's not your problem to deal with. Just stay focused on the rebuilding─that's how you'll best help us."
