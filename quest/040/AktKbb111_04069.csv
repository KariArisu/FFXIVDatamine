1,"TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_01","In eager tones, Lalah informs you that the analysis of the mystery plant is complete. It has been determined to be muscmaloi, a variety of herb that possesses potent aether-fortifying properties, owing to which its cultivation is outlawed. Having been thwarted from obtaining it at the arboretum, the fugitives will likely seek other means of procurement, and Lalah has identified an apothecary at Lost Hope as a source for the herb. On your way to find this individual, you next make for Black Brush Station in central Thanalan."
2,"TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_02","No sooner do you arrive at Black Brush Station than you meet with a distressed woman who fits the description of the apothecary. She breathlessly explains that three strangers have suddenly set upon a customer of hers, and you and Lalah rush to Lost Hope and the man's aid."
3,"TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_03","True to your suspicions, the strangers are your fugitives─but who should the customer at their mercy be but Faldrinet. You force your way between the healer and his assailants, and a standoff ensues. After a tense exchange, Loifa uses his power to enhance an antling, but provoked to anger by Faldrinet, Mahaud and Ancel suddenly fall to their knees in pain. Though it is not immediately clear what is happening to them, your priority is to deal with the fell beast, which Faldrinet has lured away."
4,"TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_04","You catch up to the beast and put it down before it can cause harm. The deed done, you turn to assist Faldrinet."
5,"TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_05","Thanks to your ministrations, Faldrinet is soon back on his feet, and together you return to the scene of the confrontation with Loifa."
6,"TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_06","You find Mahaud and Ancel still suffering from their mysterious ailment. Observing their symptoms prompts Lalah to recall rumors of a forbidden procedure said to have been conducted by a Sharlayan healer years ago─rumors that were summarily dismissed by the Forum. Nevertheless, the fugitives' plight gives her cause to wonder...but Loifa offers no confirmation and simply mocks her naivety. Again they make to teleport away, but ere they do so, the apothecary hesitantly steps forward, having recognized Mahaud and Ancel as her children..."
7,"TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_07","The confrontation thus concluded, the apothecary recounts her tale. Mahaud and Ancel are her adopted children, she explains, and when they were both gravely ill, a Sharlayan healer by the name of Guildivain appeared and offered to cure them. The man took them away, and she had not seen them for years...until they seemingly came for Faldrinet."
8,"TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_08","After Faldrinet takes his leave, the apothecary reveals that it was him rather than the fugitives who sought to purchase her muscmaloi. She also tells you about a merchant in Aleport from whom Faldrinet procures rare alchemical ingredients. The plot duly thickened, Lalah suggests returning to Idyllshire to ponder recent revelations."
9,"TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_09","Lalah confesses her confusion at recent developments, which seems to contradict her assumptions. The rumors of a renegade sage conducting depraved experiments are of particular concern, for the nature of the fugitives suggests there may be a kernel of truth to them─yet the Forum was nevertheless adamant in their denial. While she attempts to make sense of everything, you resolve to spend your time fruitfully by further honing your skills.

※The next sage quest will be available from Lalah Jinjahl upon reaching level 75."
