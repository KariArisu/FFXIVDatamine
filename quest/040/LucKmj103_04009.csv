2,"TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_SEQ_02","You get back to the Rising Stones to find Krile also returned, and she briefs you on all that transpired at the recent Alliance council. With the Empire still at war with itself, the Alliance has turned its attention to the primal problem once more. Working with friendly factions among the beast tribes, they hope to explore new avenues for peace, a development which only adds to your comrades' determination to find a cure for tempering. On that note, the impromptu meeting concludes, and Tataru suggests you wait for Cid in Dawn's Respite."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_SEQ_03","G'raha Tia positively beams with delight as Cid enters the chamber, and the pair enjoy a brief but joyous reunion. Soon after, thoughts turn to the matter of the locked report and Cid sets to work. Using the calculating power of a magitek terminal, he succeeds in identifying the late Owen's password, and you watch intently as the Allagan technologist appears in holographic form and explains the mechanism by which eikons make thralls of men. It is duly confirmed that, like those corrupted by Light, the souls of the tempered are subject to stagnation. <Emphasis>Unlike</Emphasis> with the victims of the sin eaters, however, you learn that one cannot reanimate a tempered soul without also intensifying the victim's fanatical faith. When you articulate this dilemma, G'raha Tia is inspired to theorize that an adapted version of memory transference might make it possible to perform targeted reanimation, and it is decided that you will rely once more on magitek terminals─this time to formulate a magick."

Some while later, you enter the workshop at Revenant's Toll to find preparations well underway, the terminals successfully configured with the assistance of the ever-capable-if-not-available Nero. After confirming that all is ready, Cid gives the order to begin. While the terminals conduct their endless simulations, you decide to take a moment's rest...and awaken to a scene of chaos as the devices threaten to overload. Mere moments before they break down, the magick is revealed to G'raha Tia, who heaves a sigh of relief before turning to everyone with a smile. At long last, the world has a cure for tempering."
