※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_SEQ_01","Mayaru Moyaru eagerly welcomes you to celebrate this year's Moonfire Faire. As he tells it, the highlight of this year's festivities is to be a delightful dessert commissioned by the ever-generous Master Gegeruju, and his colleagues would welcome the aid of an adventurer like yourself in preparing it. He invites you to speak with his colleague Haermaga should you be so inclined to join the effort.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_SEQ_02","Haermaga offers a hearty welcome, seemingly greatly relieved at your arrival. It would seem that preparations for the dessert Master Gegeruju has commissioned have hit an unfortunate snag─to wit, the ice that is to serve as the primary ingredient for the frosty delight is nowhere to be found. He encourages you to check in with his fellow faire attendant P'obyano and see what you might glean about its whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_SEQ_03","P'obyano greets you and relates the situation in detail. Commissioned to craft the most delicious frozen dessert the realm has ever seen, a renowned confectioner named Nekeke struck out to the northern seas in search of the finest ice in all Eorzea─and naught has been heard from her since. As P'obyano ponders what might have befallen her special guest, you are interrupted by a scream coming from the beach. The faire attendant confirms that it is none other than Nekeke who appears to be drowning in the water, and you quickly rush to the confectioner's aid."
4,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_SEQ_04","Rescued from an untimely demise, Nekeke pieces together her fragmented memories and relates to you her travails. In retrieving a chunk of pristine ice from the harsh, snow-swept northern isles, it would appear that she inadvertently brought along with it a particularly blustery fiend that was responsible for sinking her ship, and now threatens to wreak havoc on the typically peaceful shores of Costa del Sol. P'obyano is quick to assure her, however, that you and your friends are more than up to the task of quelling this menace, and the two of you set off to consult with Haermaga about what might be done."
5,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_SEQ_05","You apprise Haermaga of the situation, and are heartened indeed when a contingent of veteran battlers appears out of the blue to assist you in dispatching the Bombard threat. Steeling yourself for a heated battle, you prepare to face the explosive fiend. Make for the Isle of Endless Summer, and do your part to save the Moonfire Faire by defeating the Ice Bombards in the FATE “A Blizzard of Bombards.”

※The FATE “A Blizzard of Bombards” can only be completed as a Disciple of War or Magic."
6,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_SEQ_06","Thanks to the bravery of you and your companions, the blustery Bombard menace has been banished from the Isle of Endless Summer, and Nekeke can at long last commence work on her masterpiece. Pay visit to the confectioner and let her know that she need worry about exploding balls of ice no longer."
7,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_SEQ_07","With the beaches of the Isle of Endless Summer safe once more, Nekeke vows to create a dessert that will please the Master Gegeruju's discerning palate and aesthetic eye. All that remains is to wait for her to complete her work before the festivities can truly begin."

58,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_HAERMAGA_000_013","You see, though we've been tasked with making the most delightfully frosty dessert, we are suffering from a lack of the all-important ingredient: ice."

65,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_POBYANO_000_023","He promised us that he would spare not a single gil to see the deed done, so we decided to enlist the services of one of the realm's most prominent confectioners. All well and good to this point, yes?"
66,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_POBYANO_000_024","As it turns out, this confectioner was a hopeless perfectionist. Insisting that only the finest ice in all of Eorzea would serve for her creation, she hopped on the next vessel to the northern seas."
67,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_POBYANO_000_025","...And that's the last we saw of her. It's not that I fear for her life, mind you─pardon the pun, but she's one tough cookie. That said, the festivities are all but upon us, and if she doesn't make it back soon..."

79,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_NEKEKE_000_036","We began the journey back, and just as we were approaching Costa del Sol...it's no use. The only thing I remember is our vessel capsizing, and my body being flung from the deck along with my hard-won supply of ice."

91,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_NEKEKE_000_044","Yes, as a matter of fact... The ice, you see, is everything I hoped it would be. Which is why it was rather to my chagrin when I later discovered that a dreadful fiend slumbered in the rather large chunk of ice that I had loaded onto our vessel."
92,"TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_NEKEKE_000_045","Yes, it's all coming back to me now. As we neared Costa del Sol, with the balmy winds drifting in, I heard a dreadful rumbling coming up from the cargo hold..."
