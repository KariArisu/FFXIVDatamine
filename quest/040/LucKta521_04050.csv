59,"TEXT_LUCKTA521_04050_VILLAGERD03954_000_101","No? Well, if you're sure... I'll set about studying it at once."
60,"TEXT_LUCKTA521_04050_VILLAGERD03954_000_102","Oh, I should mention that the chief was looking for you. Seems he has news to share. It's something dreadful, I shouldn't doubt..."

68,"TEXT_LUCKTA521_04050_VILLAGERD03954_000_154","Thank you! With the bits from the extra specimens, I think we can put together something useful─even if we're inevitably doomed to fail."

71,"TEXT_LUCKTA521_04050_VILLAGERD03954_000_251","You know, I've been feeling a little bit more optimistic in spite of myself. By keeping occupied with our work, I find my mind doesn't stray towards the doom and gloom as often as it used to. Seems it's better to take action than being idle with negative thoughts."
