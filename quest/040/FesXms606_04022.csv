※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_SEQ_01","With preparations for the Starlight Celebration all but completed, the time is nigh for your final task─fashioning a decoration that will serve as a personal gift to your fellow helper Isainne in her time of greatest need. Amh Garanjy encourages you to reflect on all you have learned about your young friend and what she wants most this season, and to let inspiration carry you where it will. Giving deep thought to the matter, you set out to make one child's Starlight dreams come true.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_SEQ_02","After a good time spent meticulously packing and re-packing snow and experimenting with assorted articles of garb, you manage to achieve what you were striving for─a delightful recreation of Isainne and her beloved parents in snowman form. Stepping back to admire your work, you make a wish in your heart that it brings even the faintest of smiles to your young friend's face."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_SEQ_03","You return to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, where you are greeted by your friends and colleagues. Amh Garanjy, Kamlito Halito, and no lesser a personage than the Saint of Nymeia himself lavish praise upon you for your most inspired work, and Isainne is nigh moved to tears at your most touching gesture. The saint further brightens the mood with the news that they were able to procure sufficient quantities of the remedy, meaning that Isainne's father might be cured of his dreadful malady at last, allowing them to celebrate the season as a family after all. What began with a worry that the festivities might be called off entirely has ended with a Starlight miracle for the ages. Happy to have played your part to see smiles come to the realm once more, you bid a fond farewell to your companions and set out to enjoy the season in your own way."

50,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_AMHGARANJY_000_020","Now, let's get to work, shall we? I've prepared an assortment of decorative materials for the occasion, so feel free to let your imagination run wild!"
51,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_AMHGARANJY_000_021","That said, we mustn't forget who our audience is. What sort of snowman do you suppose would most warm little Isainne's heart?"

When he shared your story with the proprietor, they simply insisted that we deliver this to you straight away."
73,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_KAMLITOHALITO_000_063","What's more, they have at long last discovered a means by which they can produce the remedy in vast quantities. Rest assured that all those who are suffering as your father is will have succor soon enough."
74,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_GODBERT_000_064","(-Saint of Nymeia-)Speaking of your father, my child, I took the liberty of delivering the first dose to him in person.

77,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_KAMLITOHALITO_000_067","Yes, this season has taught me much. Coin is but a means to an end─not a goal in and of itself. If it is not used to bring a smile to those who need it most, it has little more value than a lump of coal."
78,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_GODBERT_000_068","(-Saint of Nymeia-)Ho ho! I daresay you've come far in this short time, Kamlito. Your father will be most proud to hear of this, I'm sure. Yes, you will prove a worthy successor to him, I am sure."
79,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_KAMLITOHALITO_000_069","About that, Lord Ma─er, good Saint, sir...I've decided not to take over Father's business after all."
80,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_KAMLITOHALITO_000_070","It surprised me as well. Over the course of preparing for Starlight, I could feel my heart changing─now, I am as certain of it as anything. When I return to Ul'dah, I mean to devote my efforts to doing all in my power to alleviate the plight of those who were not blessed with my privileges."
81,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_GODBERT_000_071","(-Saint of Nymeia-)Oho...I misjudged you, my boy. You have matured far, far beyond even my wildest expectations. So much so, in fact, that I daresay your father will have a stern word or two for me..."
82,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_KAMLITOHALITO_000_072","At any rate, I am not returning anywhere until I've celebrated Starlight to the fullest with the children of Gridania─Isainne here first among them, of course!"

84,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_KAMLITOHALITO_000_074","Let me hazard a guess─the smiles of the little ones, yes?"

86,"TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_AMHGARANJY_000_076","And with that, the moment we've been waiting for is finally at hand. Without further ado...let the festivities begin!"
