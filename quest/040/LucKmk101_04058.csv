1,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_SEQ_01","His reconnaissance mission complete, Thancred makes his long-awaited return to the Rising Stones bearing strange tidings from the imperial capital. When Alisaie inquires as to the whereabouts of his traveling companion, he explains that Urianger has gone to speak with the Alliance leaders in Ala Mhigo, where a meeting is being convened to discuss how best to proceed."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_SEQ_02","During your reunion with Urianger in Ala Mhigo, you are joined by Arenvald, who it seems also has business in the city. After an endearingly brotherly exchange with Alphinaud, he leaves you to take part in the meeting. There, Lyse relays a shocking tale. Resistance scouts sent to investigate the tower that had recently appeared nearby subsequently attempted to murder their comrades, having apparently been turned into fanatical servants of Garlemald─or, more accurately, <Emphasis>tempered</Emphasis>. It is at this point that Raubahn reveals his intention to send a second party to the tower in the form of Arenvald and Fordola, both of whom are immune to the effects of tempering. Alphinaud is clearly apprehensive about Arenvald's involvement in this dangerous undertaking, and the pair agree to discuss the matter when the meeting is over."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_SEQ_03","Despite Alphinaud's warnings, Arenvald expresses his determination to participate in the mission. While he and Fordola investigate the tower in Paglth'an, Alphinaud suggests you pursue Lunar Bahamut, but before he can continue, he is interrupted by a linkpearl call from Tataru. In flustered tones, she reports that she and Krile recently succeeded in catching up with Estinien, though he departed for Ishgard as soon as they informed him of the reappearance of the elder primal. As there are few more experienced in matters draconic, you decide to give chase in the hope of enlisting his help."

49,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALISAIE_000_001","As we still haven't heard anything on the towers from the Alliance, I'm hoping they might be able to shed some light on things."

51,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_010","Ah, a welcoming party. You needn't have gone to the trouble. From what I hear, you've been more than busy enough as it is."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_100_010","Honestly, you might have waited for me to return before discovering a cure for tempering. As it is, I can't even <Emphasis>pretend</Emphasis> to have been involved!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALPHINAUD_000_011","Well, if it's any consolation, I myself was little more than a spectator. The lion's share of the credit must go to Alisaie, G'raha, and <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. But I believe I speak for the rest of us when I say we are proud to have rendered what little assistance we could."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALISAIE_100_011","As you will <Emphasis>also</Emphasis> have heard, though, it hasn't all been tales of triumph. Just as we were taking a step towards finally addressing the primal threat, a pile of fresh problems landed in our lap."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALISAIE_101_011","Anyway, it's good to have you back. Though I can't help noticing that we're one Urianger short of a scouting party. You haven't lost him, have you?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_012","Oh, I couldn't lose him if I tried. And I did try. Repeatedly. But no, he decided to linger in Ala Mhigo to apprise Raubahn and the others of how the land lies in Garlemald."

60,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_015","Indeed. It was just as Lyse said. Worse, in fact. Devastation as far as the eye could see."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_016","Nerva and the IIIrd, however, were notable by their absence."

64,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_019","You see, the capital has been plunged into a deathly silence, with one exception: the imperial palace."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_100_019","It was a busy place before the war, but it has grown busier still, with throngs of soldiers and civilians working there day and night to rebuild─or rather, transform it."

67,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_021","That...is a difficult question to answer. The construction is vast and unsettling to behold, like something from a nightmare. According to Urianger, certain aspects of its design were clearly devised with the manipulation of aether in mind. Magitek, in other words."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_022","Yet as unnerving as said edifice was, it was nothing next to the sight of its builders. They swarmed the place like so many insects, working with nary a word exchanged between them. No one overseeing construction, no one barking orders. It was as if they were possessed...or tempered."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_023","We wanted to investigate more closely, but given our suspicions, it seemed wiser not to take the risk."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALPHINAUD_000_024","Hmm... If Fandaniel could bind Bahamut to his will, might he have done the same to the people of Garlemald?"

72,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_025","Well, be sure to save some for Urianger. Which reminds me, I have a message from Ala Mhigo."
73,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_026","Raubahn is hosting a meeting to discuss the latest findings on the towers, and he requested our presence."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALPHINAUD_000_027","Then why not leave that to us? You must be weary from your mission."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_028","No, no, I'm fine. Those towers have been on my mind since I first spied one on the way back, and I'm keen to get to the bottom of this."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_YSHTOLA_000_029","In that case, I shall stay and begin looking into another matter, as I promised Krile. We need not <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> attend."

81,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_GRAHATIA000_055","I wonder if there have been any developments regarding the Amalj'aa abductions. It can be no mere coincidence that the incidents began occurring just as the towers first appeared."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_THANCRED_000_060","Although I was only in Revenant's Toll a short while, I did manage to squeeze in a brief drink with F'lhaminn. Spring water only, it being a flying visit."

86,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALPHINAUD_000_073","Arenvald! Whatever are you doing here? When we spoke via linkpearl, you told me you'd be away on a mission!"
87,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ARENVALD_074","And who's to say this isn't part of it? But enough about that. It's good to see you looking so...similar. I thought you'd have grown a bit taller after a whole year in another world, but apparently not!"
88,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALPHINAUD_000_075","Well, I am sorry to disappoint you. While my soul may be a year older, my body has hardly aged─<Emphasis>as you are well aware</Emphasis>."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALPHINAUD_000_076","And may I remind you that we Elezen are known to be late bloomers, especially in terms of our height. Mark my words, the day will come when even a great aurochs such as yourself will crane your neck to meet my eye!"
90,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_URIANGER_000_077","Aye...'twas not until my twentieth summer that I myself outgrew my boyish proportions...though Moenbryda towered over me nonetheless."
91,"TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_ALISAIE_000_078","Arenvald brings out the best in Alphinaud, doesn't he? They both seem so at ease in each other's company. It's almost endearing."
