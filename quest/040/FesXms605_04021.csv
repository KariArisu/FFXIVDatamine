※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_SEQ_01","Thanks in no small part to your own efforts, preparations for the Starlight Celebration are proceeding apace, but there is still much that needs be done before the festivities can commence in earnest. As the next order of the day, Amh Garanjy would task her favorite helper with replenishing the supply of seasonal wreaths, which is already running dangerously short of demand. Speak with the chief celebrant's passionate colleague to see how you might serve to that end.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_SEQ_02","Ever in the spirit of the season, the celebrant joyfully informs you that one of her contacts at the Botanists' Guild has generously offered to donate an ample supply of wreaths to the cause. Make for the Botanists' Guild in her stead and procure the much-needed goods, that no doorway in Gridania might go unadorned this Starlight. "
3,"TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_SEQ_03","Your botanist contact at the guild is clearly in a giving mood, as he happily provides you with all the wreaths you could ask for and then some. You strike off back to Greatloam Growery, confident that the celebrant will be overjoyed to see your most impressive haul."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_SEQ_04","As expected, the celebrant is beside herself with joy to see your mission a success, and a healthy supply of lovingly crafted Starlight wreaths ready to be distributed to the townspeople. Your rejoicing is interrupted, however, when you overhear the conversation of a mother and son passing by alluding to Isainne having troubles at home. Though the celebrant invites you to return to Amh Garanjy and claim another well-deserved gift from the twinklebox, you cannot help but be concerned about this news regarding your young friend..."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_SEQ_05","Back at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, you pop another lid off the twinklebox and claim your present at Amh Garanjy's urging. Almost immediately, you are joined by Kamlito Halito, who seems to have taken his passion for snowman-building to still greater extremes, and shortly after that by none other than the Saint of Nymeia himself. After expressing his admiration for his young charge and the genuine passion with which he now pursues his Starlight preparations, he sheds light on the concerning situation surrounding Isainne. As he tells it, the girl's father is gravely ill, forcing the child to spend her days working to save up coin for a remedy─one so rare that it is all but impossible to come by even for those few who could afford it. As the saint and Kamlito muse as to what might be done to bring succor to Isainne's family, all of you agree that you must strive to do all that you can in the moment to see that the girl's Starlight is a truly special one."
