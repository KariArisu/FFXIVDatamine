Just between you and me, I couldn't help but notice a similar-looking device sitting all alone atop the Mattock, and a group of children eagerly gathered around it. Perhaps Edilaude means to put on a show for them as well?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKHZ007_04005_ISHGARDIANA04005_000_020","Edilaude just dropped this here and ran off laughing like a woman possessed. Whatever could it be?"

65,"TEXT_LUCKHZ007_04005_EDILAUDE_000_071","Of <Emphasis>course</Emphasis> they did! The incredible spectrum of colors, the unsurpassed elegance with which they dance and dart through the sky─only a fool or a blind man would fail to appreciate the spectacle!"

67,"TEXT_LUCKHZ007_04005_EDILAUDE_000_073","Bertha here was my pride and joy when I served on the front lines. I couldn't count the number of times she saved me from the ravaging claws of the Horde."
68,"TEXT_LUCKHZ007_04005_EDILAUDE_000_074","When the war ended, I figured she'd just end up all alone, collecting dust in the dark corner of some storehouse. So I offered to take her home myself, with the promise that I'd keep her well maintained and put her to good use─and my natural aptitude for pyrotechnics has allowed me to do just that."
69,"TEXT_LUCKHZ007_04005_EDILAUDE_000_075","We may no longer have need for weapons to shoot dragons out of the sky, but I mean to give Bertha here a new life shooting sheer beauty into the sky, and bringing joy and hope to the people of our nation."
70,"TEXT_LUCKHZ007_04005_EDILAUDE_000_076","But why stop at Ishgard? Yes, one day I will journey across all of Eorzea with Bertha in tow, lighting up the skies in all corners of the realm with a spectacular rainbow of fiery blossoms!"
71,"TEXT_LUCKHZ007_04005_EDILAUDE_000_077","For the part you've played in helping me realize my life's work, I thank you. As do, no doubt, all who will one day bear witness to the wonders that you have helped me introduce to the world!"
72,"TEXT_LUCKHZ007_04005_EDILAUDE_000_078","And with that, I give you leave to resume your travels. But wherever you roam, always look to the sky─for you never know when Edilaude's fabulous fireworks will return to grace your eyes once more!"
