1,"TEXT_LUCKSA351_04097_SEQ_01","As Zlatan explains, the House of Splendors has reached an agreement with goblin metalworkers in Idyllshire to supply the Resistance with the reagent needed to refine your weapon. In exchange, you have been asked to provide two varieties of mechanical parts─compact axles and springs, thirty of each.

※Mechanical parts can be obtained by participating in skirmishes and critical engagements in Zadnor, as well as any of the normal Alexander 8-man raids. The Unrestricted Party option cannot be enabled when clearing the aforementioned duties."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA351_04097_SEQ_02","You return with an assortment of mechanical parts, and after verifying everything is accounted for, Regana's colleague, Seika, hands over the reagent. With the transaction concluded, she takes her leave, but not before proposing an extended contract for additional shipments of reagent. Gerolt promptly refuses, but Seika appears unperturbed by the rejection. This reaction leaves Zlatan wondering if there was more to her proposal than meets the eye."

61,"TEXT_LUCKSA351_04097_ZLATAN_000_003","For our part in the bargain, we've been asked to procure two varieties of mechanical parts. They must be of the highest quality if we are to appease the goblins' discerning eyes."
62,"TEXT_LUCKSA351_04097_ZLATAN_000_004","Supposedly, the parts in question are commonly found in an apparatus employed by the Illuminati as well as the Empire's forces. We've been asked to collect thirty of each."

76,"TEXT_LUCKSA351_04097_SEIKA_000_067","As a fellow artisan, I'm sure you can appreciate the convenience of a surplus stock. What's more, such a contract would eliminate much of the clerical work in requesting more from our goblin colleagues."

81,"TEXT_LUCKSA351_04097_SEIKA_000_072","Well, you are free to believe what you will. With or without this contract, so long as the goblins get their parts, we can continue to do business."
