0,"TEXT_FESEST701_04089_SEQ_00","Jihli Aliapoh greets you with anxious enthusiasm.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST701_04089_SEQ_01","Jihli Aliapoh shares with you her prophetic dream for this year's Hatching–tide, a vision wherein rabbits and chickens work paw in claw to decorate the town for the annual event. She explains, however, that there has been a slight hiccup in the preparations, and asks that you look for her egg-collecting colleague Nonotta at the Greatloam Growery.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST701_04089_SEQ_02","You find Nonotta in costume at the Greatloam Growery, and she introduces you to Master Pawlin─the owner of a flock of excitable chickens. After listening to Nonotta's woes, you are suddenly tasked with facing down an escaped hen. Gazing deep into the feathery fiend's soulless eyes, you sense quite distinctly that the flock wants Pawlin to dish out their extra-special feed..."
3,"TEXT_FESEST701_04089_SEQ_03","Pawlin confirms that he does indeed have a special mix for extra-special occasions. Once they have finished feeding the voracious birds, however, an exhausted and miserable Nonotta pleads with you to undertake the perilous duty of egg collection. She stands ready to send you off with a basket and a prayer."
