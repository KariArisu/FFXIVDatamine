1,"TEXT_SUBCTS827_04057_SEQ_01","You learn from an Ironworks engineer of the existence of an incredible mechanical dragon. Assuming his hastily attached signal emitter is functioning correctly, the “wyrm-machina” can be found somewhere on the floating mass of Azys Lla."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS827_04057_SEQ_02","Your search of Azys Lla is interrupted by the familiar figure of the wandering minstrel. In typical extravagant fashion, he regales you with a tale told to him by a fellow traveler─of the legend of Landerwaffe, an ancient masterpiece of Allag which has hunted down through the ages for a suitable master. In light of your command of a multitude of gwibers, the minstrel seems convinced that the mechanical dragon will heed your call. With the instrument of its summoning in hand, you have only to blow a single shrill call from the deck of the Flagship."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS827_04057_SEQ_03","True to the lore, the call of your flute has indeed been answered by the wondrous and lustrous Landerwaffe. The wandering minstrel is so moved by the sight that he composes a verse on the spot, immortalizing the moment in which machina and master stand poised to begin a whole new chapter of grand adventure. Even fate itself must bend before the mighty partnership of the Shadowmaker and the Dragon Made!"

50,"TEXT_SUBCTS827_04057_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_003","It flew right above me several days ago, you see, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Er, “it” being a shiny black dragon."
51,"TEXT_SUBCTS827_04057_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_004","Not one of those Dravanian beasts, you understand. And I'm fairly certain─at least ninety-five percent─that it wasn't the primal Bahamut. Before you ask, “then what was it!?” well, that's exactly what I'd like to find out!"
52,"TEXT_SUBCTS827_04057_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_005","I do have a working theory, of course. It was only in view for a few moments, but I definitely saw flames shooting out from behind when the dragon accelerated...which was obviously some method of propulsion wherein an ignited fuel source was directed through an exhaust system to provide additional thrust, thereby─"

54,"TEXT_SUBCTS827_04057_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_007","Anyway, my point is that this was no living, breathing creature. I was witness to a mechanical creation─a wyrm-machina, if you will."
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS827_04057_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_008","I just <Emphasis>had</Emphasis> to know more. Even as my mind screamed “What in Cid's spare parts drawer is that!?” my hand moved on pure instinct, grabbing a signal emitter and hurling it at the thing's gleaming underbelly.
