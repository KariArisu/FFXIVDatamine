1,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_SEQ_01","Conon thanks you for entertaining his entreaty, and shares you the plan he hopes to put into action. To wit: he would see completion of the reconstruction effort celebrated─and pay tribute to Lord Francel's selfless contributions─by holding a surprise commemorative concert. He has already recruited Marcelloix to the cause, and the enterprising provisioner has already prepared a host of instruments. Finally, they suggest one final step to make the occasion truly special─they intend for you and Francel to take the stage together and perform a duet. That said, they are unsure as to what instrument the young lord most fancies. At their request, you offer to inquire with Foncrineau, that you might glean the information necessary."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_SEQ_02","Foncrineau is overjoyed at your offer to hold a concert in Lord Francel's honor. Quick to offer his aid with anything you might need, he suddenly hits upon an idea, and bids you wait while he summons a certain personage who might be especially suited to lend support to your efforts."
3,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_SEQ_03","Minutes later, none other than Lord Artoirel appears on the scene. The renowned collector of orchestrion rolls─and accomplished composer in his own right─proffers one of his own pieces for the occasion: a piano duet he penned in honor of the Firmament's rebirth. More certain than ever that the event will be one to remember, you set off for Saint Roalle's Dais to practice for your own role in the festivities."
4,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_SEQ_04","You plink and plonk about at the piano for a spell of time, but find the complexities of Artoirel's composition beyond your fingers' ability to articulate. You are, however, confident that you will be able to perform the piece to your satisfaction with more practice. Take a seat at the piano again and see what fruits your efforts might bear."
5,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_SEQ_05","After what feels like hours of practice, you at long last feel confident in your ability to do Artoirel's masterwork justice. Seek out Mariorie, who has been charged with overseeing the festivities, and inform her that you are ready to take the stage."
6,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_SEQ_06","Mariorie beams at hearing that you are ready for the concert, and cheerfully informs you that the other performers have all but assembled as well. It is nigh time to raise the curtain on the Firmament's crowning hour."

As for me, I'm pleased to report that business at my provisioners' shop is positively booming of late. Truly, I owe it all to you and Lord Francel."
53,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_MARCELLOIX_000_014","Speaking of which, that is precisely why we had hoped to speak with you today. We were discussing how nice it would be if we were able to do something to celebrate the Firmament's restoration, and express our gratitude to Lord Francel for all he has done on our behalf."
54,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_CONON_000_015","I was speaking with Foncrineau, and he mentioned that his master is particularly fond of music, and in fact has long dreamed of establishing his own orchestra."
55,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_CONON_000_016","While that may be beyond our abilities, I thought the very least we could do would be to arrange for a concert of sorts to be held in his honor."
56,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_CONON_000_017","To that end, we are working to acquire the needed instruments...without consulting Lord Francel. We mean for this to be a surprise, you see."
57,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_CONON_000_018","My friends tell me that you are among Lord Francel's closest friends and confidants. I am certain that nothing would please him more than to see your face among the performers. What do you say?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_MARCELLOIX_000_019","Splendid! I knew we could count on you. I, too, have endeavored to do my part by putting together the necessary instruments, using parts and techniques I learned from a traveling artisan in town."
59,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_MARCELLOIX_000_020","It's far from a full orchestra, I'm afraid, but at the very least, we have a piano, woodwinds, and strings. We just set the piano in Saint Roelle's Dais before coming here. Fortunately, it did not seem to arouse Lord Francel's suspicion."
60,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_MARCELLOIX_000_021","Furthermore, I've made an effort to procure a pair of every instrument. Should the mood strike Lord Francel, I thought few things would stir the hearts of the townspeople than seeing the two of you play a duet."
61,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_MARCELLOIX_000_022","That said, I must confess that I am unsure as to what instrument our benefactor most favors. Might you be so kind as to inquire with Foncrineau for me? And pray remind him not to divulge the matter to Lord Francel himself..."
62,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"

72,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_FONCRINEAU_000_051","A concert, you say? To commemorate the completion of the restoration effort? Lord Francel would be overjoyed─of this I have no doubt. Truly, I cannot thank you enough for your most generous sentiment."

79,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_ARTOIREL_000_064","My steward Firmien mentioned that he had heard from an attendant of House Haillenarte word of plans for a celebration commemorating the Firmament's restoration. I take it that you, too, are involved with this?"
80,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_FONCRINEAU_000_065","I took the liberty of informing Lord Artoirel of your intention to hold a concert in Lord Francel's honor."
81,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_FONCRINEAU_000_066","Perhaps you are unaware, but Lord Artoirel is one of the realm's foremost collectors of orchestrion rolls. Much as I had hoped, he has taken a keen interest in your idea."
82,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_ARTOIREL_000_067","To tell the truth, in addition to my collection, I have been known to dabble in the art of composition myself."
83,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_ARTOIREL_000_068","As a matter of fact, I have penned a duet for the piano inspired by the sights and sounds of the Firmament. Nothing would give me greater honor than if you and Francel were to perform it together at the festivities."
84,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_FONCRINEAU_000_069","A splendid idea, indeed. My lord has quite a passion for the piano, and I am certain he would be more than pleased to perform your piece."
85,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_FONCRINEAU_000_070","If my eyes did not deceive me, a most stately piano already sits atop Saint Roelle's Dais. If you have a moment or two to spare, pray consider playing a little tune or two on it to practice. Often it takes time to get accustomed to a new instrument."
86,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_FONCRINEAU_000_071","In the meantime, I shall ask around and see if I cannot find a few more skilled performers willing to join you up on stage."
87,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_ARTOIREL_000_072","Marvelous! In that case, I shall return home and prepare a transcription of the score at once."
88,"TEXT_LUCKHA302_04000_ARTOIREL_000_073","I must confess, just the thought of hearing the sweet sound of music ringing out across the Firmament has me feeling as giddy as a schoolboy. It will be all I can do to stop myself from skipping and dancing through the streets."
