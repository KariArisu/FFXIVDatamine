Word has spread of <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s use as a flesh medium for sensory perception data, ergo additional non-corporeal entities now desire a demonstration."
49,"TEXT_BANOMI127_04633_STIGMA4_000_002","This experience could easily be achieved by visiting the café. Preliminary calculations, however, suggest that appeasing them with a trial in their colony will prove an effective means of publicity for the Last Dregs."

Visit the abode of the Ea and make contact with the itinerant server unit at your earliest convenience."

55,"TEXT_BANOMI127_04633_A1_000_001","The potentially metaphorical single slice of bread."

Look at how the poor, fleshy thing is forced to fill its oral cavity with the organic foodstuff, using its lingual nerve to collect flavor as it masticates matter with its teeth! Then, the finale...deglutition. How messy! How troublesome! How <Emphasis>primitive</Emphasis>! "

64,"TEXT_BANOMI127_04633_EAOMI04633_000_023","Yes, yes, I am confident what you consumed was the kneaded and baked result of finely powdered grain. “Why not simply ingest the grain in its original state,” I pondered, but my proverbial eyes have been opened! Not only does it have a uniquely satisfying mild flavor, but an unbelievably soft texture too!"
65,"TEXT_BANOMI127_04633_EAOMI04633_000_024","Invigorating flavors of acidity and sweetness wash over me─the firm, succulent texture of the victual immovable from the forefront of my mind.

70,"TEXT_BANOMI127_04633_STIGMA4_000_031","Congratulations on your successful ingestion. Though this outcome was expected, it is also desirable. Guerrilla demonstration will be logged as an effective means of encouraging interest in sensory perception."
71,"TEXT_BANOMI127_04633_STIGMA4_000_032","It is fortunate that a number of Ea were present during your execution of objectives. Due to their lack of physical form as well as conditional operating protocols, luring them to the Last Dregs has been surpassingly difficult, even for tactical specialists."
72,"TEXT_BANOMI127_04633_STIGMA4_000_033","However, those who watched this demonstration from afar may choose to participate in the future. Should the opportunity present itself to carry out a similar operation, your services will be required once more."
