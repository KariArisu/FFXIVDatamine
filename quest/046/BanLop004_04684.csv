※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANLOP004_04684_SEQ_01","Dreamingway raises the matter of the ashen-furred Loporrit, who it seems can often be found loitering near the Watcher's Palace. He wishes to inquire as to what about the Dreaming Workshop has failed to inspire this wayward Way, and thus do the two of you make for the wide open spaces of Mare Lamentorum.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANLOP004_04684_SEQ_02","Though you find the pallid Loporrit and inquire as to their state of mind, they seem unwilling to divulge much beyond cynical quips. They do mention Livingway's name, however, along with their desire to return to the hibernation from which you once saw the furry tribe awaken."
3,"TEXT_BANLOP004_04684_SEQ_03","Upon consulting with Dreamingway, you agree that your next course of action is to inquire with Livingway. It is possible that the Loporrits' leader has valuable information as to the source of the distress that plagues this most melancholy of Loporrits."
4,"TEXT_BANLOP004_04684_SEQ_04","Livingway tells you the story of Counselingway, a passionate Loporrit with the weighty responsibility of helping people with their troubles─a role which they spent their life eagerly anticipating, only to be told that the people of Etheirys would not be coming after all. This disappointment understandably plunged them into the depths of despair, and they have yet to emerge. Though the task that lies ahead may be more difficult than you could have anticipated, if anyone is to convince Counselingway that life remains worth living, it must be the Dreaming Ways."
5,"TEXT_BANLOP004_04684_SEQ_05","You reconvene with Dreamingway in Hoper's Hold, where he shares the tragic tale of Counselingway with Managingway. Managingway points out that this is not the only Loporrit the Dreaming Workshop has yet to inspire─and that these wayward Ways share the commonality of having once been tasked with interacting with the people of Etheirys directly. As their distress appears to originate with the loss of the friendly interaction they had anticipated, Dreamingway proposes that you get them together in pursuit of a common goal once more, that camaraderie might stimulate their dormant motivation."
6,"TEXT_BANLOP004_04684_SEQ_06","As one of the very people of Etheirys that the listless Loporrits once dreamed of meeting, you have little difficulty convincing them to join you in the creation of a mural in Hoper's Hold. One can only hope that they will feel slightly more up to the challenge once they have their paintbrushes in paw."
7,"TEXT_BANLOP004_04684_SEQ_07","With your artists successfully recruited, you speak with Dreamingway. He provides you with details and materials for the art supplies that you must create, and you set to work."
8,"TEXT_BANLOP004_04684_SEQ_08","Making the absolute most of your proffered supplies, the no-longer-listless Loporrits create works of art that testify to their most profound emotions─and they enjoy doing it, too. Though this is still not enough to convince the cynical Counselingway, you have brought great happiness to Bestways Burrow this day, which is a success worth painting about."
