However, he insists that Erichthonios stay behind, fearing him to be a liability during such a dangerous endeavor.

With the last of her waning strength, she reveals a truth that Lahabrea long concealed for his son's peace of mind─namely, that Athena intended to use Erichthonios as a test subject for her experiments. Pieces of the puzzle are beginning to fall into place, with the promise of more to be found as you make ready to confront Hephaistos at last."
