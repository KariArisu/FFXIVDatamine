1,"TEXT_BANOMI005_04605_SEQ_01","During your regular check-in with N-7000, it once again indicates satisfaction with the present status of the Last Dregs. This observation is reaffirmed by Jammingway, who estimates your café may even be as well-patronized as Sharlayan's famous Last Stand. Wishing to be certain, the management team heads on-site to confirm.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANOMI005_04605_SEQ_02","You arrive at the Nekropolis to find that the Last Dregs is doing well─a little <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> well, in fact. With no objectives left to achieve in order for the café to be considered a success, N-7000 asserts that it has no choice but to consider its mission accomplished and enter permanent hibernation for maximum efficiency. Jammingway is, of course, hopping mad about their business partner's imminent demise, but the Omicron is either unwilling or unable to be talked out of its protocols at present, and heads for Base Omicron despite their protests. Uncertain of what to do, yet knowing you must do something, you elect to pursue it."
3,"TEXT_BANOMI005_04605_SEQ_03","You make your way to Base Omicron without trouble, but N-7000 is nowhere to be seen. According to the local Omicrons that kindly scan the relevant data for you, it proceeded through the fallow portal. It has also been checking Sir's logs..."
4,"TEXT_BANOMI005_04605_SEQ_04","You find N-7000 at the long-dead Tree of Life, where apparently the mysterious Sir also came to ruminate while operating as M-017. Though it has yet to find a way around the logic of its inevitable shutdown, it is clear that it would if it could. You remind it that its existence, in some ways, is already an impossibility, which at last spurs it to consider the idea that its potential is not bound by petty scientific laws. Alas, the resulting epiphany is so engaging that it immediately overclocks its processors and becomes lost in multi-sim mode, which appears liable to cause a meltdown any moment now."

6,"TEXT_BANOMI005_04605_SEQ_06","Stigma-4 indicates that Omicrons take their sustenance in liquid form, with coolant being vital to their maintenance. What is more, the logic matrix suggests your intervention may prove the necessary impetus to bring about the change in dynamis that
N-7000 clearly desires. With data about an ingredient that may be of use in refrigerant in mind, you make for what may generously be termed the “wilds” of Ultima Thule."

Stigma-4 has helpfully collected N-7000's immobilized carapace in the meantime, so you need only sit back and watch as the unit is forcibly rebooted.

It vows to continue running the café in the name of all that has not yet been, but could be, in hopes of a more meaningful future for the Omicron civilization. You spend a joyous time picnicking with your fellow Last Dregs managers in celebration, though it is not long until the unlikely business partners are once again at loggerheads. On and on they shall go, you imagine, unto the very end of the universe─and perhaps beyond."
