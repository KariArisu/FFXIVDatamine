0,"TEXT_CHRHDY101_04652_SEQ_00","The House Manderville manservant has been patiently waiting to speak with you.
※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_CHRHDY101_04652_SEQ_01","With no small degree of trepidation, you approach the House Manderville manservant to offer your assistance in Godbert's weaponsmithing endeavor. The servant responds with deferent appreciation, and directs you towards their base of operations in a corner of the High Crucible.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDY101_04652_SEQ_02","Upon reaching the crafting station, the manservant departs to inform Lord Manderville of your arrival. Godbert appears in short order, and after providing you with a brief history of Manderville weaponry, introduces you to the third member of your crew: the legendary blacksmith, Gerolt. Various obstacles yet stand in the way of Godbert and the recreation of his ancestor's armaments, and your particular task will be to acquire a sufficient quantity of manderium meteorite. According to Gerolt, the sky rocks in question might be available from one of Rowena's lackeys, Jubrunnah, who has set up shop near the city aetheryte. Suspiciously convenient."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDY101_04652_SEQ_03","You approach Jubrunnah, and find that the opportunistic merchant has a large quantity of meteorite pieces in stock. Gil is the preferred currency of collectors the world over, but not for Rowena's very special customer, oh no. It seems her agent has been instructed to charge you a sizable bounty of Allagan tomestones for each chunk of fantastically rare sky rock. And Gerolt will need three of them."
4,"TEXT_CHRHDY101_04652_SEQ_04","You deliver the manderium meteorite to the waiting blacksmith, who wastes no time in beginning the oil extraction process. The inert results are disappointing, to say the least. Godbert chooses that moment to make his appearance, treating a dumbfounded Gerolt to an outrageously masculine display of alchemy which transforms the liquid into glowing Exalamanderville. With all the necessary components now in place, Gerolt takes up his hammer, and succeeds in forging what is apparently only the first iteration of your chosen Manderville weaponry. Further refinements, however, will have to wait until Godbert has deciphered the next passage of his ancestor's manual. For the moment, it seems you are free to spend your time as you see fit. Embroiled in another madcap case, perhaps...?"

61,"TEXT_CHRHDY101_04652_GODBERT_000_021","And so, let us begin...with a detailed exposition on the history of Manderville weaponry!"
62,"TEXT_CHRHDY101_04652_GODBERT_000_022","First of all, when I say “Manderville weaponry,” what I refer to is the series of masterpieces crafted by the legendary artisan, Godbrand Manderville, the first lord of House Manderville."

85,"TEXT_CHRHDY101_04652_GODBERT_000_061","The second is the crafting of ornamentation which will amplify the weapon's aetheric intensity."

88,"TEXT_CHRHDY101_04652_GODBERT_000_064","As for the third and final problem wanting for resolution, we require a vial of Exalamanderville. If one has access to an industrial-size alchemical furnace, it should be possible to extract this superlative mineral oil from manderium-rich meteorites."
