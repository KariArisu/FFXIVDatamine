※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANLOP003_04683_SEQ_01","Hopes bolstered by the success of the machining station, Dreamingway is eager to continue expanding the dreams on offer, and Managingway naturally has detailed thoughts on potential next steps. They suggest cooking as a dream unlikely to have occurred to many a Loporrit before─though due to this population-wide dearth of culinary expertise, the new station must needs be manned by Cookingway, or no one at all. With that in mind, you and Dreamingway set out for Old Sharlayan, where the Loporrit chef has been continuing his studies into Etheirys's cuisine of late.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

As the residents of Bestways Burrow typically plate whole carrots─if, indeed, the carrot gets that far─and gnaw upon them directly, however, place settings and utensils will be required."
5,"TEXT_BANLOP003_04683_SEQ_05","At Cookingway's suggestion, you inquire with Dickon at the Last Stand about the accoutrements necessary for serving proper cuisine. He provides you with a robust list to deliver to Managingway, noting that he himself would love to partake of lunar fare should the opportunity arise."

7,"TEXT_BANLOP003_04683_SEQ_07","Having created restaurant supplies of Loporrit proportions, you make your delivery to Dreamingway so that the cooking can begin.
