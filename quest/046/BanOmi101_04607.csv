Be aware that there is a perfectly good, pre-synthesized compound available to eliminate all traces of organic life from the applied area with a minimum of effort."
49,"TEXT_BANOMI101_04607_STIGMA4_000_002","However, the disheveled manager objected quite shrilly to its use. They insist on a weaker chemical agent, which must be produced at great expense from nearby materials. Although this is an inefficient course of action, engaging in debate with diminutive life-forms is projected to be equally taxing."

56,"TEXT_BANOMI101_04607_KARELEAN04607_000_015","They're a threat not only to the harvest itself, but to the beliefs our people hold dear. Do you recall the rounded glyph at the heart of our fields? It is an ancient symbol of good fortune, passed down by our forebears. It seems the local flora have no respect for tradition, however."
57,"TEXT_BANOMI101_04607_KARELEAN04607_000_016","We must keep it free from obstruction, lest we forget its message: that our scientific zeal led to our destruction, and only by returning to the old ways did we find life anew. Now, I'd best get started mixing these ingredients."
58,"TEXT_BANOMI101_04607_KARELEAN04607_000_017","Ah, a resupply is always welcome! Thanks to you, the symbol remains visible as a reminder to all and sundry. Not to mention that our harvest is more bountiful than ever before!"

63,"TEXT_BANOMI101_04607_STIGMA4_000_032","The belief that such symbols are a catalyst for good fortune is categorized as “nonsense.” However, the glyph's positive effect on worker morale and the flow of dynamis bears further analysis."
64,"TEXT_BANOMI101_04607_STIGMA4_000_033","Analysis indicates that the rich harvest is merely a statistical aberration, and not a direct consequence of the crop circle. Yet its continued positive effect on morale─in defiance of all logic─cannot be denied, so its upkeep is worth the cost of resources and time."
