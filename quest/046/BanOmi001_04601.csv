※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_01","You speak to Jammingway, who has good news, bad news, and news of an as-yet-undetermined nature. The good news is that Stigma-4 has managed to fully reconstruct members of the Karellian civilization based on data obtained from the Dead Ends; the bad news is that it chose two Karellians of opposing factions, who are now poised to kill each other before they have even had their coffee. After some cajoling, Jammingway manages to corral them to a table─but there is no time to solve their civilization-ending disagreement just yet. First, you must investigate a new star that mysteriously appeared in the expanse of Ultima Thule in recent days, and see if it poses a threat to the continued operation of the Last Dregs.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_02","Prompted by N-7000, you proceed to Base Omicron, where Stigma-4 has helpfully established a facility from which the newborn star might be studied. This station─designated A-4 Research─will enable you to journey to the star itself via teleportation processes that remain beyond your understanding."
3,"TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_03","Though N-7000 is able to complete a quick scan of the new star and determine that it is, indeed, entirely unknown and yet untouched, your exploration is soon interrupted by an emergency transmission from Stigma-4. Tensions have erupted at the Last Dregs over the serving of food unsuitable to Karellian tastes, and manager intervention is required. Jammingway is uncertain of what cuisine might be more palatable, but as they nevertheless ponder a future in which café patrons enjoy delicious dishes made with fresh, local ingredients, the area around you is reborn as land ripe for the tilling. Given that the newborn star is entirely composed of dynamis, your allies conclude that in this “Elysion,” pure sentiment can make the impossible, possible."
4,"TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_04","In the interest of preventing further unnecessary bloodshed, you return to the Last Dregs, though tensions have cooled somewhat by the time you arrive. With a bit of prompting, the Karellian patrons indicate that they would be willing to consume a salad, and thus are you set upon a quest to find palatable vegetation in this dismal land..."
5,"TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_05","By some miracle, the salad that the Last Dregs staff manages to assemble with your provided ingredients proves both aesthetically appealing and satisfying to the Karellian palate, going so far as to prompt the erstwhile adversaries to consider how they may benefit from compromise. At Jammingway's bold suggestion, the pair both agree to set down their weapons and take up the hoe in service of a better future."
6,"TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_06","You return to Elysion on the heels of the Karellians to find that their optimism has created a blooming garden for them to tend, and even reconstituted others of their kind. With all manner of flora abounding, there is hope that peace and unlimited salad will reign eternal in this place."
7,"TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_07","At your inquiry, Omicron N-7000 indicates that it is similarly pleased with the impact that the Karellians have had on Elysion. In light of the data provided by recent experience, it asks that you join it in A-4 Research to discuss the future of the Last Dregs."
8,"TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_08","In A-4 Research, Omicron N-7000 runs a series of mental simulations of the future of the café. It and Jammingway conclude that with the help from the life-forms of civilizations past and a great deal of dynamis, the Last Dregs' potential to please its patrons and bring joy to the sea of stars is endless."
