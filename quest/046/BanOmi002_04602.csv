※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANOMI002_04602_SEQ_01","Upon checking in with Omicron unit N-7000, you learn that Stigma-4 has but recently replicated a new set of patrons for the Last Dregs. Though they are not like to enjoy three managers of varying shapes and sizes hovering over them while dining, you nevertheless agree to check on Patron-003 and Patron-004 together with N-7000 and Jammingway, hopeful these new customers find the café environment agreeable.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest. "
2,"TEXT_BANOMI002_04602_SEQ_02","When you arrive at the Last Dregs, you see that your new customers are Grebuloffs─the diminutive tribe whose last days you witnessed in the Dead Ends. Their memories of the grim occasion are apparently quite similar to yours, as you find one sobbing into their salad while the other sighs mournfully. It would appear that they long for a glorious yesteryear, though that is about as much as you can glean before they take off at a sprint, heedless of Jammingway's shouted offer of tea."
3,"TEXT_BANOMI002_04602_SEQ_03","You make for the unmemoried portal only to find that the Grebuloffs have already departed Ostrakon Hena. N-7000 helpfully suggests inquiring with patrol units at Base Omicron who may have detected their passing."
4,"TEXT_BANOMI002_04602_SEQ_04","N-7000 transmits recorded data of the Grebuloffs to nearby Omicron patrol units. They in turn provide useful data of their own, indicating that your rogue patrons ran through Base Omicron in the direction of the clouded portal, and have likely passed through it already."
5,"TEXT_BANOMI002_04602_SEQ_05","You relay the information you collected to N-7000, who agrees with your conclusion. With little hope of catching up to the Grebuloffs without knowing where in Ostrakon Tria they have disappeared to, your party resolves to ask the Ea if they have seen any tiny creatures in diving suits sprint past their abode."
6,"TEXT_BANOMI002_04602_SEQ_06","When you meet N-7000 and Jammingway in the abode of the Ea, they have already located an informative individual, who tells you that the Grebuloffs did indeed come this way. As they were apparently in search of water, the Ea directed them to the wellspring of regret, where they may yet remain."
7,"TEXT_BANOMI002_04602_SEQ_07","Though you at last locate your Grebuloff customers at the wellspring, it seems they are not much happier for having reached a water source, as it pales in comparison to the ocean of their own star─which was, as both you and they recall, horrifically corrupted along with almost the entire Grebuloff population during their version of the apocalypse. In the hopes of evoking even slightly less depressing memories in these poor souls, Jammingway suggests that you prepare a dish using ingredients with the comforting fragrance of the sea. As you head off to procure just such a thing, they and N-7000 set about coaxing the Grebuloffs out of their breakdown and back to the Last Dregs."
8,"TEXT_BANOMI002_04602_SEQ_08","Fortunately, both management and patrons make it back to the café intact, and no sooner do you provide N-7000 with sufficiently sea-smelling ingredients than do it and Jammingway prepare a cerulean soup for your beleaguered customers. The dish does its work in reminding them of happier times, and though they fervently wish that they had taken better care of their most precious natural resource, the memory of the many joys it brought their people cheers them significantly. This emotional about-face seems to trigger something in the dynamis of Elysion, for you immediately receive a transmission from Stigma-4 indicating that changes have been wrought upon the star."
9,"TEXT_BANOMI002_04602_SEQ_09","You proceed to Elysion with your allies to find the Grebuloffs happily playing at a seaside identical to those once found in their homeland. Though N-7000 appears to be the Omicron version of “inspired” by your success in turning the creatures' soul-deep despair into this hopeful scene, it confesses that it yet harbors doubts about what meaning can be found in the life of a replicated being. Jammingway, however, confidently assures it that, though the Omicrons and your café patrons may have been created from the memories and emotions of the long dead, the ability of their feelings to affect dynamis proves that they matter just as much to the cosmos as anyone else─and should behave accordingly."
