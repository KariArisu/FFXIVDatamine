※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANLOP005_04685_SEQ_01","Dreamingway summons you to a meeting of minds, intent on dreaming up a station that can revive the ashen-furred Loporrit's zest for life. You settle on an idea that would allow them to communicate with the people of Etheirys regardless of distance─radio. As you have only ever been on the listening end of such devices, however, the technical requirements will need to be gleaned from experts before you can set to work. In the meanwhile, Dreamingway asks that you accompany him to tempt no-longer-Counselingway with word of the project."
2,"TEXT_BANLOP005_04685_SEQ_02","You and Dreamingway find the ashen-furred Loporrit in their usual spot, gazing at the faraway Etheirys. The mention of radio prompts the lengthiest proclamation you've heard from them thus far, revealing that they maintain a keen interest in being of the utmost aid to mankind. Whether they will follow through on their stated intent to provide additional input on programming remains to be seen, but it appears you have at least piqued their interest..."
3,"TEXT_BANLOP005_04685_SEQ_03","Back in Hoper's Hold, you consult Dreamingway and Managingway about the equipment required for creating radio transmissions. Though the instructions are somewhat unclear, your craftsman's competence has carried you through thus far, and there is no reason to believe it shall not do so again."
4,"TEXT_BANLOP005_04685_SEQ_04","You present the necessary equipment─probably─to Dreamingway, and the broadcasting station is created with minimal incident. With some encouragement, the ashen-furred Loporrit is persuaded to voice the inaugural broadcast, transmitting a message of newfound hope to people across Etheirys. Are you listening?"
