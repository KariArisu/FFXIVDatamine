※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANOMI003_04603_SEQ_01","You speak with N-7000 and Jammingway, who commend you on your work with the Karellians and Grebuloffs. Never one to stand still when they could be dragging you around, however, Jammingway insists on taking you to visit the Last Dregs to see the current state of the café for yourself.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANOMI003_04603_SEQ_02","To say that all is not going as well as your colleagues anticipated would be an understatement, given that you arrive to find that Patron-005 and Patron-006─of the nihilistic Nibirun civilization─have triggered an existential crisis in one of the Omicron barkeeps. N-7000 steps in to prevent a complete system shutdown and is fortunately able to redirect Nibirun attentions to the other settlements of Ultima Thule for a time, but it is clear that making satisfied customers out of these individuals will be a monumental undertaking. Seeking a better source of emotional influence and potential custom, the three of you agree to try the Ea, instead."
3,"TEXT_BANOMI003_04603_SEQ_03","You journey to the abode of the Ea, where Jammingway proposes dividing your forces in the hopes of striking upon a likely customer. As ordered, you direct your attention to the mysterious stone formation where members of the ethereal civilization seem to congregate."
4,"TEXT_BANOMI003_04603_SEQ_04","Though you speak to two Ea, neither seems the least impressed by your offers of quality food and beverages. Perhaps Jammingway and N-7000 have had better luck─but probably not."
5,"TEXT_BANOMI003_04603_SEQ_05","Indeed, your fellow Last Dregs managers have met with round dismissal at the spindly hands of the Ea. Having taken this all rather personally, Jammingway insists that you make another attempt to pique their curiosity─this time, together."
6,"TEXT_BANOMI003_04603_SEQ_06","You speak again with the sophistic Ea, this time petitioning it to answer just a few questions. It has no objections─evidently, incessant questioning is something of a pastime among the Ea─and goes so far as to invite a friend to join in. Though the pair end up asking more questions than you do, your rousing discussion nevertheless manages to stimulate their desire to learn more of the gustatory sensations they may have once experienced. To this end, your fellow managers propose experimenting with various dishes to see if any resonate, and send you off in search of unfamiliar flavors."
7,"TEXT_BANOMI003_04603_SEQ_07","Having delivered the necessary ingredients to N-7000, you gaze with trepidation upon the various dishes Jammingway has prepared. As your role as taste-tester demands, however, you bravely sample all that you can manage, providing gustatory data for N-7000 to pass along to the Ea. They are pleased─if slightly flummoxed─by the result, managing even to identify shellfish as a flavor their people may have once enjoyed. Curious to see if this has had any effect on the star, Jammingway leads the way to Elysion."
8,"TEXT_BANOMI003_04603_SEQ_08","You arrive on Elysion to find it inhabited by new life─a species of jellyfish-like creatures matching naught real or reconstructed in N-7000's database. The Ea speculate that these creatures might be born of some long-lost memory of their infant forms, and dub them the “Miw Miisv” in hopes that they may unlock further insights into the corporeal Ea that once were."
