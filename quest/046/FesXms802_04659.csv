0,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_00","Associate Professor Laurenssen is experiencing some panic.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_01","In light of his reindeer's disappearance, Laurenssen's calm is disintegrating faster than a snowman in midsummer. Being the kind-hearted soul you are, you prepare to /soothe him like none but a somewhat exasperated adventurer can.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_02","Thanks to your diligent patting, Laurenssen regains his composure and is ready to find Blitzen. He sends you off towards Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to gather witness testimonies, while he retraces his steps back to Apkallu Falls."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_03","Witness testimony has informed you of Blitzen's likely whereabouts. You jingle merrily as you run for some reason, but such things are hardly unusual during the Starlight season. Pay it no mind and head for New Gridania."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_04","You and Laurenssen successfully find Blitzen and, rather unexpectedly, the Saint of Nymeia, who has one of those faces you swear you've seen somewhere before. With a little hinting, Laurenssen realizes the error of his ways. He resolves to think less selfishly and more of the children, and as though fate intends to hold him to it, a despondent and childlike wail breaks out from the other side of the aetheryte plaza."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_05","Upon investigating the source of the noise, Laurenssen is faced with a weepy child in search of her mother. After a crucial assist from Blitzen, who effortlessly quells the child's hysterics with a spectacular illusion, Laurenssen uses his own special powers of shouting very loudly to summon the missing mother without incident. Family reunited and balance restored, the three of you tromp back to Amh Garanjy."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_06","Amh Garanjy thanks you for your help, Laurenssen thanks you for your patience, and Blitzen honks loudly. It is clear now that the mystical illusions of reindeer are only triggered by genuine feelings of fondness and concern for children, and cannot be recreated under contrived pretenses. Embracing this reality with goodness in his heart, Laurenssen asks you to accompany him on a turn of Gridania to deliver cheer and spectacle to as many children as you can find."
