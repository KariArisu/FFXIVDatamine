※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_01","In light of his reindeer's recent disappearance, Laurenssen's calm is disintegrating faster than a snowman in midsummer. Being the kindhearted soul you are, you prepare to /soothe him like none but a slightly harrassed adventurer can.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_02","Laurenssen regains his composure thanks to your diligent patting and is ready to find Blitzen. He sends you off towards Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to gather witness testimonies, while he retraces his steps back to Apkallu Falls."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_03","Witness testimony has clued you into Blitzen's whereabouts. You jingle merrily as you run for some reason, but such things are hardly unusual during the Starlight season. Pay it no mind and head for New Gridania."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_04","You and Laurenssen are safely reunited with Blitzen, and then with the Saint of Nymeia, who has one of those faces you swear you've seen somewhere before. With the help of a little coaxing─and a subsequent lecture─Laurenssen realizes the error of his ways in forgetting the true meaning of the Starlight Celebration. He resolves to think less selfishly and more of the children, and as though fate intends to hold him to it, a despondent and childlike wail breaks out from the other side of the aetheryte plaza."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_05","Upon investigating the source of the noise, Laurenssen is faced with a weepy, sticky, lost child in search of her mother. After a crucial assist from Blitzen, who effortlessly quells the child's hysterics with a spectacular display of the Ghost of Starlight Present, Laurenssen uses his own special powers of shouting very loudly to summon the missing mother without fuss. Family reuinited and balance restored, the three of you tromp back to Amh Garanjy."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS802_04659_SEQ_06","Amh Garanjy thanks you for your help─Laurenssen thanks you for your patience─and Blitzen honks loudly. It is clear now that the Ghost of Starlight Present is only triggered by genuine feelings of fondness and concern for children, and cannot be recreated under contrived pretenses. Embracing this reality with goodness in his heart, Laurenssen asks you to accompany him on a turn around Gridania, to deliver cheer and spectacle to as many children as you can find."
