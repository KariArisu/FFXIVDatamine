1,"TEXT_AKTKRA205_04639_SEQ_01","With Pandæmonium free from Hephaistos's control, the way forward is clear of obstacles. Lahabrea senses that his other half is cloistered away within the depths of Tartaros, where Athena carried out her most clandestine research. Themis makes ready to send you and the chief keyward to confront Hephaistos, that you might rid the world of his wickedness once and for all.

※Abyssos: The Eighth Circle can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA205_04639_SEQ_02","In the heart of Tartaros, you find yourself embroiled in a frenetic battle that sees Hephaistos taking form after form, stretching the very boundaries of creation magicks. In the end, however, even the purloined power of Pandæmonium's prisoners is no match for your own, and the would-be god falls to you and your phantom band. At your heels, Lahabrea stands ready to at last set right the mistake of his past."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA205_04639_SEQ_03","As Lahabrea is about to deal the killing blow, Hephaistos shields himself with the insensate Erichthonios, prompting Lahabrea to at last reveal the truth of Athena's intentions before his son. A few well-placed words stir Erichthonios from his stupor, and gathering what strength he can, the keyward breaks free from the magic binding him. He inters Hephaistos in an aetherial casket, around which Lahabrea works his own magicks until all that remains is a fiery red crystal."
4,"TEXT_AKTKRA205_04639_SEQ_04","You take a moment to check in with Lahabrea, who is impressed that his son was able to work the magic of interment so adeptly, and even verbalizes the sentiment. With the immediate threat vanquished, there are questions that demand answers, and truths that demand to be told."

50,"TEXT_AKTKRA205_04639_LAHABREA_000_010","The vision you saw told the story far more eloquently than I ever could. Athena was consumed by her research, and was willing to sacrifice her own child if it hastened her progress."
