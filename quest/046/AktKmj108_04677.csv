1,"TEXT_AKTKMJ108_04677_SEQ_01","As Nahbdeen resolves to instruct the people to seek shelter, you offer to investigate Khadga, where the fiend that arose from the Bhaflau remnants is believed to be. Grateful for the help, the Radiant commander suggests that you speak with the quarry workers at the Giantsgall Grounds, which is situated at Khadga's base. Apparently, a man named Qetanur is likely to know one of the paths to the summit."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMJ108_04677_SEQ_02","According to Qetanur, a rockslide may have rendered the primary path nigh impassable. Thankfully, one of his fellow quarry workers, Sramul, is said to climb like a langur, and may know an alternate route."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMJ108_04677_SEQ_03","Though initially reluctant to send you headlong into danger, Sramul shows you an alternate trail that leads to the mountaintop. And so you begin your climb to ascertain who or what has made its nest atop Khadga."
4,"TEXT_AKTKMJ108_04677_SEQ_04","At the summit of Khadga, you come face to face with the archfiend of fire, Rubicante. While the coming battle promises to be difficult, you can but hope that victory will bring you one step closer to uncovering Golbez's scheme.

5,"TEXT_AKTKMJ108_04677_SEQ_05","Rubicante rains fire upon you and your comrades, but his flame soon flickers and fails. Battered and beaten, the archfiend offers to tell you his lord's grand design, confident that the knowledge will not change the outcome."
6,"TEXT_AKTKMJ108_04677_SEQ_06","Golbez is intent on invading the Source, that the denizens of the void may be granted true death and return to the Lifestream. The revelation rattles Zero, who chastises the archfiend for his methods in pursuit of release. For pride and honor, Rubicante then reveals where Golbez and Azdaja may be found: on the moon of the Thirteenth."
7,"TEXT_AKTKMJ108_04677_SEQ_07","Though she understands Rubicante's motivations, it remains to be seen if Golbez is driven by a similar hunger. Indeed, with his dying breath, Rubicante suggested that his lord harbors a desire all his own... Regardless, Zero believes there is a better way forward, a future she hopes to one day see made reality. "
