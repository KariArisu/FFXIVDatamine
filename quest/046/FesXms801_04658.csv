※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_SEQ_01","Amh Garanjy, celebrated Starlight celebrant, introduces you to Laurenssen, an associate professor visiting from Sharlayan. As a dignified scholar of folklore, Laurenssen enlists your help in preparing an experiment that he hopes will prove the origin story of reindeer symbolism─the Ghost of Starlight Present, a mystical illusion summoned by reindeer to bring joy to the hearts of children. Laurenssen sends you off to gather a crowd of children, while Blitzen, the reindeer at the crux of this operation, blinks balefully, seemingly less than enthusiastic...

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_SEQ_02","Despite asking various children to come and see your magical reindeer, you end up with only a single taker. Reflecting upon where you might have gone wrong, you head back to Laurenssen."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_SEQ_03","Laurenssen is disgruntled by the notable lack of rosy-cheeked cherubs, but decides to try the experiment nonetheless. It ends in abject failure and literal tears, which Laurenssen temporarily excuses himself to dab. You listen to the soothing sounds of Apkallu Falls and wait for his return as you contemplate the finer points of mortal existence."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_SEQ_04","No matter how long you wait, Laurenssen fails to return. A lesser <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> would simply abandon him to his misery, but no─this is the season of generosity, and you are a greater <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>. You set off towards the Greatloam Growery and the distinctive sound of messy sniffling."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_SEQ_05","Laurenssen admits that he has been reflecting upon where he might have gone wrong, and has arrived at the conclusion that the children of Gridania were not inspiring enough for his reindeer─who is notably absent. Realizing his companion is no longer blinking balefully beside him─or anywhere, for that matter─Laurenssen rushes off. You remind yourself that you are a champion of the people, and follow him before he trips and hurts himself."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_SEQ_06","To say Laurenssen is worried would be to adopt the sort of understatement favored by used-airship salesmen and politicians. Visibly shaking with the horror of losing his only true companion, Laurenssen vows to find his darling Blitzen, but it is painfully evident he will need a touch of courage from an adventurer's heart before he is fit enough to try..."

61,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_007","An easy question, was it not? I apologize if I insulted your intelligence─indeed, the answer is “reindeer.”"
62,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_008","Bear? Do you...have a personal affinity for bears, perhaps? Regardless, the correct answer is “reindeer.”"
63,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_009","Yeeeeee...? Oh, you mean “yeti.”
...Yeti!? Why on earth would such a bloodthirsty beast symbolize the Starlight Celebration!? The correct answer is “reindeer”!"
64,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_010","Not on account of ignorance, surely, as even the most feeble-minded could provide a serviceable guess. But I suppose I can enlighten you, nonetheless─the answer is “reindeer.”"
65,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_100_010","From gifts to garb, Starlight parapernalia is often emblazeoned with or designed in the image of these noble creatures."

67,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_AMHGARANJY_000_012","When? You mean to say it was not always so?"
68,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_012","No indeed! Any mention of reindeer is conspicuously absent from the original Ishgardian tales of Starlight. So I ask again─whence and wherefore did the reindeer call?"
69,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_013","I have spent many a dedicated moon researching these perplexing quandaries, and finally, in a Coerthan tome of arcane origin, I discovered testimony of a phenomenon most queer─to wit, the Ghost of Starlight Present!"
70,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_100_013","It is said that reindeer in possession of these magicks would conjure mysterious illusions of gifts and whimsy to delight young hearts during the winter season."
71,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_014","Surely it was the selfless procurement of these phantoms that earned reindeer their Starlight celebrity─and so I have come to Gridania with Blitzen in order to definitively prove the veracity of my claims!"

73,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_AMHGARANJY_000_016","Oh! So Blitzen is the sort of reindeer that can conjure the Ghost of Starlight Present?"
74,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_017","Yes, Blitzen is of an endangered pedigree, currently protected within Labyrinthos as we continue our research. Typically, their ability to weave optical illusions is used as a precaution against would-be predators."

76,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_020","However, it is my belief that this very line of reindeer are those mentioned in the testimony I found, making Blitzen one of the few remaining successors of his bloodline's traditions."
77,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_021","Once he recreates the Ghost of Starlight Present with his unique capabilities, my erstwhile theories will become immovable fact! It shall be a singular triumph in the history of folklore!"

82,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_026","I shall be at Apkallu Falls, making the necessary preparations upon Blitzen. We await your triumphant arrival!"
83,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_AMHGARANJY_100_026","A good place to start may well be the path from the markets to the Lancer's Guild. I daresay many a youngling will be out gazing starry-eyed at the shops and decorations."

110,"TEXT_FESXMS801_04658_LAURENSSEN_000_092","It only stands to reason─the original texts are <Emphasis>Ishgardian</Emphasis>, after all, meaning the Ghost of Starlight Present must have been witnessed by Ishgardian children! I was a fool to think of proving my theory anywhere else!"
