49,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_MANAGINGWAY_000_002","Her dream is to see that all Loporrit-kind enjoy a long and healthy life abrim with safety. At present, she's hard at work on an invention to protect us from parasitic fungal spores─and the infectious diseases they can induce. Nasty stuff."
50,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_MANAGINGWAY_000_003","The moon's surface is full of all sorts of perils─inhale even one stray spore and we could find ourselves with a runny nose, rashes all over, or heavens, even loss of fur! If she can find some way to prevent such travesties from occurring, I for one would welcome it."
51,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_MANAGINGWAY_000_004","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Do you have a moment to spare? Protectingway has requested your aid once again."
52,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_MANAGINGWAY_000_005","It seems her invention─the parasital infection protection suit, or PIPS for short─works, and now she wishes to bolster its production."
53,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_MANAGINGWAY_000_006","For the sake of all Loporrits present and─well, present, I ask that you meet her in Bestways Burrow, and assist her with the production of this invaluable device."
54,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_PROTECTINGWAY_000_007","Ah, hello there! I take it Managingway sent you here to assist me. Your help is much appreciated!"
55,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_PROTECTINGWAY_000_008","As Managingway undoubtedly informed you, I'm constructing a suit designed to shield the wearer from infectious spores. Unfortunately, I'm short on deft paws able to craft the most essential components─or rather I was, until you came."
56,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_PROTECTINGWAY_000_009","It would be wonderful if you could use these spare metal parts to craft a fastener for the suit to ensure it stays airtight! Should you run out of materials, I'm just a hop, skip, and a jump away!"
57,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_PROTECTINGWAY_000_010","It would be wonderful if you could craft an airtight fabric for the suit─can't have it letting in the stray fungal matter, after all! Should you run out of materials, I'm just a hop, skip, and a jump away!"
58,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_PROTECTINGWAY_000_011","It would be wonderful if you could craft an adhesive to ensure the suit remains airtight! Should you run out of materials, I'm just a hop, skip, and a jump away!"
59,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_PROTECTINGWAY_000_012","When you've finished, please take the component to Managingway. I wish to implement it into the suit straightaway upon my return to the machining station!"

67,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_MANAGINGWAY_000_021","Ah, I see you've already crafted the necessary material. If it were anyone else, I would be inclined to put this through several inspections─but I know we're in good paws with you. Protectingway will doubtless be thrilled."
68,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_MANAGINGWAY_000_022","Still, I wonder why she thought to create a protective suit. Rather than address a symptom of the problem, would it not be more effective to attack its source, and eradicate the infectious fungi in the first place?"
69,"TEXT_BANLOP112_04698_MANAGINGWAY_000_023","Well, it is not for me to question the dream of another. My thanks for your kind assistance!"
