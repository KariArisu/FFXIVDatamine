※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANOMI004_04604_SEQ_01","N-7000 and Jammingway are pleased to report that the Miw Miisv seem as happy as giant jellyfish from the sea of stars can possibly be─which is to say, quite. With the aim of experiencing the lively air these young creatures have imparted to the Last Dregs, you agree to accompany your fellow managers on their rounds.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANOMI004_04604_SEQ_02","You find the Last Dregs bustling but not overcrowded, leading to the inevitable proposal that you procure yet more patrons. Ever overflowing with ideas, Jammingway asserts that the dragons would be prime candidates. Though N-7000 expresses strong reservations given its civilization's role in the Dragonstar's untimely end, it is eventually convinced to make contact in the name of a better future for all involved."
3,"TEXT_BANOMI004_04604_SEQ_03","You proceed to Reah Tahra, where Jammingway attempts to hail a representative of the Dragonstar. Though they do eventually succeed in this first step, it quickly becomes clear that your allied units will struggle to generate interest in the Last Dregs─or any feeling at all─due to the dragons' utter emotional exhaustion from having spent eons in mourning. Upon discussion, it is agreed that a dragon of more agreeable disposition might provide ideas on raising her kin from their dead-eyed torpor, so you make ready to return to Etheirys and consult with wise Vidofnir."
4,"TEXT_BANOMI004_04604_SEQ_04","Though she is aware of her people's history with the invaders from the Alphatron Star, Vidofnir elects to concern herself with the welfare of her fellow dragons rather than ancient grudges. She explains to your party that the sacred peaks of the Dragonstar once evoked such bittersweet nostalgia in Midgardsormr that he chose his brood's new home by the look of its mountains─the peak now known as Sohm Al first among them─and suggests you attempt to stir her lost kin's memories of the same. Fortunately, there is a Coerthan dessert that may do just that."
5,"TEXT_BANOMI004_04604_SEQ_05","Armed with the knowledge of which terrestrial resources once brought a nostalgic tear to Midgardsormr's eye, you gather the perfect ingredients near Anyx Trine, and set about making a confectioner's Sohm Al. Though your guest from Reah Tahra is reluctant at first, the sight of the dessert recalls memories of the Dragonstar's mountains that resonate to his very core, filling him with wistful fondness. Indeed, he soon wishes to bring other dragons to the Last Dregs for a similar experience, and reassures N-7000 that this will not mean the resuming of hostilities─for what is past is long, long past."
6,"TEXT_BANOMI004_04604_SEQ_06","Alongside your allies, you venture to Elysion, a portion of which has now been transformed into a vision of the Dragonstar. Peaks tower over a clutch of eggs, and hope that dragons may soon coast upon the breeze reigns. Apparently more affected by N-7000's previous statements than they let on, Jammingway takes this success as an opportunity to remind the unit of its life's worth, and its power to bring about change─scientific limitations be damned."
