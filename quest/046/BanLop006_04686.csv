※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANLOP006_04686_SEQ_01","Upon your inquiring with Dreamingway, he produces a stack of letters─mail for the Loporrits from the people of Etheirys. It seems that the Dreaming Ways' broadcasts have been both received and appreciated, and you are entrusted with delivering the good news to those who have shared their aspirations over the radio.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANLOP006_04686_SEQ_02","You deliver the first letter to Coiningway, who is delighted to read that Sharlayan's economists have taken an interest in the unique market he established in Hoper's Hold. Perhaps one day the Loporrit carat will see wider circulation...or perhaps not."
3,"TEXT_BANLOP006_04686_SEQ_03","The second letter is for Inventingway, whose passions have resonated with the mechanically minded people of Garlemald. A representative of the fallen nation entreats his aid in rebuilding─a request to which he is most willing to acquiesce. One can only imagine what surprises might await next you visit the Garlean capital..."
4,"TEXT_BANLOP006_04686_SEQ_04","You carry your next letter to Cookingway, who has seen a surge in orders at the cooking station. Despite the popularity of his proffered fare, he is concerned that carrots remain a dominant ingredient, and, with a solely Loporrit clientele, has few sources of inspiration as to alternatives. Fortunately, his delivery is from Dickon at the Last Stand, who has helpfully included a recipe of his own design, along with a request that Cookingway send along any ideas he subsequently dreams up. With this fruitful partnership established, Hoper's Hold is certain to be home to fresh flavors in no time."
5,"TEXT_BANLOP006_04686_SEQ_05","The final two letters are intended for the erstwhile Counselingway. They open the missives to find words of gratitude and admiration, and are deeply moved to learn that they have touched hearts on Etheirys after all. They offer you their thanks for helping them find their way, and introduce you to their new appellation─Talkingway─in anticipation of many friendly conversations to come."
6,"TEXT_BANLOP006_04686_SEQ_06","Having seen each letter to its rightful recipient, you report to Dreamingway. He reflects on the unlikely but indisputable success of the Dreaming Workshop, thanking you for your contribution on behalf of Loporrit-kind. You part ways with a formal invitation to visit any time you like─for, even with new dreams in their hearts, the Loporrits will always be waiting for you."
