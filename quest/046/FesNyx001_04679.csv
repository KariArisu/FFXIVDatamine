1,"TEXT_FESNYX001_04679_SEQ_01","The ryu metsuke is pleased to inform you that this year's Heavensturn celebration, which sees the draconic ryu honored in the Far East, is underway. However, he is <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> so pleased to inform you that their mascots─chocobo chicks dressed in ryu costumes─are struggling to win over the locals. Wishing to discover the cause of the cold reception, the metsuke bids you assist his delegation's leader, the ryu bugyo, who can be found at the edge of the Aftcastle with her feathered friend.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESNYX001_04679_SEQ_02","You encounter the ryu bugyo at the Aftcastle, who is eager to present Ryunosuke to her two-person audience─you, and a young girl sitting by her side. Yet while the bugyo's passion cannot be faulted, she fails miserably in her attempt to capture the girl's interest. As she is speaking to you of her woes afterwards, she realizes that Ryunosuke has wandered off after the girl, and asks for your help to find them. Thus do you make your way to the Drowning Wench, hoping to discover clues regarding their whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_FESNYX001_04679_SEQ_03","After a ryu-related misunderstanding, you manage to explain the situation to Skaenrael, who informs you that she saw a girl with a chocobo chick pass through the tavern. However, the guardswoman has no idea where they may have since headed, and at the ryu bugyo's behest, you next take your search to the lower decks."
4,"TEXT_FESNYX001_04679_SEQ_04","You have spoken with several locals on the lower decks. Among other tidbits, you learn that the young girl you seek is named Sibly, and that she fears for the safety of her merchant father, who will soon be embarking on a long voyage. Armed with this knowledge, you go to relay your findings to the ryu bugyo at Bulwark Hall."
5,"TEXT_FESNYX001_04679_SEQ_05","The ryu bugyo is pleased to hear that you have ascertained Sibly's destination. Eager not only to be reunited with Ryunosuke, but to explain the significance of his attire, your armor-clad companion sets off for the Agelyss River in middle La Noscea, where the young girl is believed to be, and you follow on her heels."
6,"TEXT_FESNYX001_04679_SEQ_06","You manage to find Sibly by the riverbed with Ryunosuke at her side. The girl apologizes for causing you trouble, but ere she can take her leave, the bugyo broaches the subject of her father and his impending voyage. Sibly explains that, on account of Llymlaen not being chosen this Heavensturn, she thought that she might instead pray to a Far Eastern deity to keep her father safe. Thus did she seek out the bugyo, only to find her too focused on her own mission to lend an ear. Reflecting upon her blunder, the bugyo is inspired by Ryunosuke and the nearby waterfalls to tell a new tale about the ryu, assuring Sibly that it will grant her comfort."
