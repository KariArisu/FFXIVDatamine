0,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_00","Lisette de Valentione's gaze is as sultry as rumor holds─and yet her eyes are wandering distractedly. 
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_01","Lisette de Valentione, vaunted emissary of love and ardor, is having sister trouble─to wit, said sister is being uncharacteristically insistent that she relieve Lisette of her duties during this year's Valentione's Day celebrations. Upon personally questioning sister Astrid, you discover that her demand stems from a desire to allow Lisette time with her betrothed during this season of romance. After pledging your own support in the matter, Lisette finally consents to her younger sister's wishes, counciling her to stay true to her heart as she fulfills her duty as an emissary of affection.

The first thing Astrid asks of you is to accompany her colleague, an emissary-in-training named Emilie, on a promotional tour around Gridania. You speak to Emilie to get started, but not before you take note of the intense look of determination on Astrid's face─and her unusually frilly outfit. 

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_02","You and Emilie set off towards the Leatherworkers' Guild to begin your advertising campaign. Behind you the lilt of a haltingly improvised love poem tells you Astrid is also hard at work.

※You must be accompanied by Emilie to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_03","You managed to snag the interest of a Gridanian resident with your enthusiastic pitch. Next, Emilie suggests you head towards the Shaded Bower."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_04","You secure another participant for the festivities, but Emilie seems somewhat thrown by his offhand compliment. Shaking off her reaction, Emilie sets her sights on the Centaur's Eye."
5,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_05","Another (rather fanciful) participant hurries off towards the heart of seasonal merrymaking, but Emilie confesses her uneasiness towards her own state of dress. In truth, she admits, she would rather wear something “adorable” rather than “handsome,” but felt it her supporting duty to contrast Lady Astrid's attire. After encouraging her to share her true feelings with Astrid, you part ways for a time to let Emilie gather her thoughts."
6,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_06","You meet Emilie back at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre only to find Astrid looking rather bedraggled. According to Astrid, receiving the attentions borne of her “darling” outfit has been exhausting and oddly disheartening, and yet she feels it is her duty as Lady Lisette's successor to weather it nonetheless. Emilie takes this chance to admit her similar feelings, and you both urge Astrid to consider that love of one's natural inclinations is as worthy a love as any other. Astrid is bosltered by your encouragement and vows to consider the kind of emissary she is best suited to become─after changing into a suit herself, that is. Exchanging outfits, Astrid and Emilie set off to continue the Valentione's Day celebrations, both brimming with confidence in body, mind, and dress."
