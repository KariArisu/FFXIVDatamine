※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_01","Lisette de Valentione, vaunted emissary of love and ardor, is having sister trouble─to wit, said sister is being stubbornly insistent that she relieve Lisette of her Valentione's Day duties this year. Upon further inquiry, you discover that her demand stems from a desire to allow Lisette time with her own beloved during this season of romance. After you pledge your support to Astrid, Lisette finally consents to her younger sister's wishes, counseling her to stay true to her heart as she fulfills her duty as an emissary of affection.

Now wearing her sister's proverbial shoes, Astrid asks you to accompany her colleague, an emissary-in-training named Emilie, on a promotional tour around Gridania. You speak to Emilie to get started, but not before you take note of the cheerful determination on Astrid's face─and her uncharacteristically frilly outfit. 

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_02","You and Emilie set off towards the Leatherworkers' Guild to begin your advertising campaign. The lilt of a haltingly improvised love poem tells you Astrid is also hard at work.

※You must be accompanied by Emilie to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."

4,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_04","You secure another participant for the festivities, but Emilie seems somewhat thrown by his compliment. Shaking off her reaction, she proclaims the Centaur's Eye as your next destination."
5,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_05","Emilie successfully invites another potential merrymaker, but in the next breath confesses her uneasiness towards her own state of dress. In truth, she admits, she would rather wear something “adorable” rather than “handsome,” but felt it her supporting duty to contrast Lady Astrid's attire. After encouraging her to share her true feelings with Astrid, you part ways for a time to let Emilie gather her thoughts."
6,"TEXT_FESVLT901_04654_SEQ_06","You meet Emilie back at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre only to find Lady Astrid looking rather bedraggled. Apparently, receiving the attentions inspired of her “adorable” outfit has been exhausting, and yet she feels it is her duty as Lady Lisette's successor to weather it nonetheless. Emilie takes this chance to admit her own discomfort, and you both urge Astrid to consider that love of one's natural preferences is as worthy a love as any other. Astrid is bolstered by your encouragement and vows to become the sort of emissary she is best suited to become─after changing into a suit herself, that is. Exchanging outfits, Astrid and Emilie continue facilitating this year's Valentione's Day celebrations with undeniable and radiant confidence."
