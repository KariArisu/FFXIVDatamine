1,"TEXT_AKTKEA203_04668_SEQ_01","Having finished visiting your destinations, Deryk expresses his concern for Krile on account of her earlier exchange with G'raha Tia. It is decided that you will check on her, to which end you first make your way to Gridania."
2,"TEXT_AKTKEA203_04668_SEQ_02","In Gridania, Menphina and Halone waste no time sensing Nophica and Byregot, but curiously note that the two are in different locations. Observing that Nophica is close by, Halone dashes off to find her sister goddess, and you hurry after her."
3,"TEXT_AKTKEA203_04668_SEQ_03","Halone leads you true, and you locate Nophica in the altar of her namesake. When pressed as to why she isn't with the others, the Matron explains that Krile wished to complete her task without divine supervision. Byregot still follows her discreetly, however, and so you decide to rendezvous with the Builder, who is near Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud."
4,"TEXT_AKTKEA203_04668_SEQ_04","Byregot informs you that Krile now makes her way to Althyk's stone. In order to hasten your passage, he summons a pair of Rhalgr's hawks to bear you and Deryk."
5,"TEXT_AKTKEA203_04668_SEQ_05","You and Deryk take to the air in search of Krile, and find her already at the stone. There, she reveals that it was the desire to seek the answers in her own way and prove herself capable that prompted her to send the gods away. Your concerns thus laid to rest, Krile then turns to the task of extracting information, and bids you await her in Quarrymill."
6,"TEXT_AKTKEA203_04668_SEQ_06","Speaking with Deryk in Quarrymill, you learn how he feels about involving himself in the lives of others. Though he believes it wrong to interfere, it seems he can't help but extend a helping hand when it comes to it."
