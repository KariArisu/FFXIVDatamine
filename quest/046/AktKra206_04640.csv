1,"TEXT_AKTKRA206_04640_SEQ_01","As Erichthonios regains his senses, Lahabrea finally shares the story of he and Athena. Conjuring phantom visions, he tells of his discovery of her experiments and journey into Pandæmonium to stop them. It is a story of betrayal and forlorn love, which resulted in Lahabrea and Athena bonding souls, and the former becoming corrupted by the latter's unquenchable thirst for knowledge. To save himself, Lahabrea was forced to cut away a part of his soul and seal it within a crystal. Yet even this was a part of Athena's scheme, as the crystal was used to imbue a vessel with life, creating Hephaistos."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA206_04640_SEQ_02","With the truth of the matter laid bare at last, all that remains is to return to the surface. While there is yet more Erichthonios would say on the revelations which just transpired, he bids the group return to Pandæmonium's entrance, where the scars of the past do not linger."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA206_04640_SEQ_03","Erichthonios thanks you and Themis for your efforts in aiding Pandæmonium─and in helping him understand his father. While questions remain as to the details of Hephaistos's experiments and Erichthonios's role in them, Lahabrea assures you that they are better left unanswered. When the topic of conversation turns to crystals, Themis remarks that the aether contained in the crystal you first showed him bore no resemblance to Hephaistos's, and wonders who might have sent it─a mystery of great interest to all present. As the others await such time as you are able to return with the crystal, they will set free the other warders, and inquire if any among them sent its message floating upon the aetherial sea."
4,"TEXT_AKTKRA206_04640_SEQ_04","You return to Claudien's laboratory to find a flustered Ruissenaud, who informs you that Claudien has gone missing and an unusual confluence of energy has been detected in the aetherial sea. Together you rush to the Aitiascope and are met with the sight of Pandæmonium floating in the once-empty void. Moments after, Fourchenault Leveilleur arrives as well, evidently drawn by the marked fluctuation in energy. Upon hearing your story, he deftly maps out a tentative course of action. Ishgard will be asked to aid in a search for Claudien, and the brightest minds in aetherial research will be gathered to keep track of changes in the aetherial sea. For the time being, he asks you to stand by to assist them when the next step is decided. He departs to make his own report to the Forum, leaving you and Ruissenaud behind to process what just occurred."
5,"TEXT_AKTKRA206_04640_SEQ_05","Before turning his wandering attention to his own report, Ruissenaud surmises that the hand behind Professor Claudien's disappearance may also have summoned Pandæmonium to the present. Like your allies in an age long past, he asks that you rest─warning that whatever may come, it is bound to demand your full strength."
