1,"TEXT_AKTKDD102_04664_SEQ_01","While the Allagan archmagus seems surprised that you survived your expedition into Eureka Orthos unscathed, she is eager to hear about what you encountered on your journey. She asks that you summon G'raha Tia to the Eight Sentinels, that you may regale them both with tales of the enemies you fought and the experiments you unearthed."
2,"TEXT_AKTKDD102_04664_SEQ_02","As you relate your battle with the cloned Tiamat, Noah seems satisfied, revealing that the ultimate purpose of her request was to see that the contributions of Allag's researchers─namely, her pupils Unei and Doga─do not go ignored by future generations. With floor thirty of Eureka Orthos conquered, your obligation to the archmagus is fulfilled, but she informs you that the deeper floors house even more dangerous creatures to combat and more lustering treasure to uncover. Whether you set foot into those treacherous depths, however, is a decision entirely up to you."

49,"TEXT_AKTKDD102_04664_KOHRABNTAH_000_001","I knew the contrivances of Allag's brightest minds would be no match for you! But of course, what else should I have expected from an adventurer of your caliber?"
50,"TEXT_AKTKDD102_04664_KOHRABNTAH_000_002","I am very much looking forward to your full report, but first you should summon G'raha Tia. I did make the boy a promise, after all."

56,"TEXT_AKTKDD102_04664_KOHRABNTAH_000_008","Thus was every available resource poured into creating a species of wyrm which would bend to Allagan will. Once Tiamat and her kin were captured, they were used to hasten the subjugation of dragonkind."
57,"TEXT_AKTKDD102_04664_KOHRABNTAH_000_009","The many clones born from this research were also used as fodder for a different project, which aimed to perfect the means by which Bahamut could be used to power Dalamud."

62,"TEXT_AKTKDD102_04664_KOHRABNTAH_000_014","Yet as an Allagan myself, I can say that at the time, they were not only a symbol of our eminence, but also a means of our survival."

84,"TEXT_AKTKDD102_04664_KOHRABNTAH_000_035","For the empire was vast, and they were loath to put all their eggs in one basket, so to speak. Doubtless other similar facilities dot the realm."

89,"TEXT_AKTKDD102_04664_KOHRABNTAH_000_042","On the lowermost floors the most volatile experimentations were carried out. I cannot in good conscience suggest you delve further, but if riches and adventure are what you seek, I can think of no better place."
