1,"TEXT_AKTKMJ101_04670_SEQ_01","After arriving in the Source, Zero required time to regain her strength, but Varshahn has informed you that, thanks to a ready supply of food, she has made a full recovery. Eager to resume the search for his sister, he bids you relay his intent to the voidsent, whom he believes may be enjoying a view of the city from the corridor connecting Yuj and Kama."
2,"TEXT_AKTKMJ101_04670_SEQ_02","You find Zero observing the people of Radz-at-Han while ruminating on the ephemeral existence of mortals. When she finally gives you her attention, you inform her of your purpose, and together make your way to Meghaduta to join the others."
3,"TEXT_AKTKMJ101_04670_SEQ_03","Your preparations complete, you and your comrades are about to set forth for the void when, without warning, Vrtra emerges from the palace and lets out a mighty roar. When he speaks again as Varshahn, he reveals that he felt his sister's presence far to the north. This unexpected turn of events prompts a change of plans─rather than the void, you now set your sights on Garlemald."

49,"TEXT_AKTKMJ101_04670_VARSHAHN_000_001","You will recall that, in exchange for aether, she agreed to aid us in our search for my sister."
50,"TEXT_AKTKMJ101_04670_VARSHAHN_000_002","At Y'shtola's suggestion, I began providing said aether in the form of food. Zero has found the arrangement to be agreeable, and has been eating steadily."
