※This quest is available for a limited time only."

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESNYX002_04680_SEQ_02","Over the quiet rush of the falls, the ryu bugyo tells you of the mighty Seiryu, one of the Four Lords of Far Eastern myth. According to the tales passed down through the bugyo's line, Seiryu was a deity who possessed mastery over water, which he used to aid mortals by quelling storms and calming seas. The existence of such a benevolent being serves to assure Sibly, who gives the bugyo her heartfelt thanks. With her task thus accomplished to her satisfaction, the bugyo suggests returning to Limsa Lominsa."

Hoping to continue her draconic discussions with those of the upper decks, the bugyo is eager to try approaching the locals once more. For this, too, she requests your assistance, and together you set off to seek out those who may be receptive to her message.

※You must be accompanied by the ryu bugyo and Ryunosuke to complete this task. Speak with either of them again should you become separated."

With an exuberation that nearly defies his years, he thanks the ryu bugyo for her service to their divine beast. The bugyo, however, will not accept the praise alone, and credits you and Ryunosuke for your tireless efforts to make this Heavensturn a successful celebration. Even as she ponders a suitable reward for your invaluable aid, the chocobo chick flutters towards your side with many a happy kweh. Both the bugyo and the metsuke interpret the gesture to mean that he wishes to join you, and you duly accept the honor. Thus accompanied by the new year's symbol of good fortune, you take a moment to revel in the celebration you have helped save."
