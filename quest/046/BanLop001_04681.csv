※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANLOP001_04681_SEQ_01","You politely inquire with Dreamingway as to his purpose on Etheirys─which, as it transpires, is to beg your aid. Many of his comrades fell into a most un-Loporrit-like listlessness upon the abrupt cessation of the exodus, and it would seem they have yet to recover. Unable to abandon them to their melancholy, you agree to travel to the moon to help determine how best to revive their spirits.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANLOP001_04681_SEQ_02","Upon your arrival in Bestways Burrow, Dreamingway encourages you to speak with a few of his moping fellows. Though their countenances indicate anything but an eagerness for conversation, you nevertheless resolve to get to the bottom of their acedia."
3,"TEXT_BANLOP001_04681_SEQ_03","Speaking to the listless Loporrits reveals them to be universally devastated by their newfound lack of purpose. In retrospect, Hydaelyn really ought to have anticipated that, but as She can no longer be consulted, Dreamingway will have to do."
4,"TEXT_BANLOP001_04681_SEQ_04","You report to Dreamingway to suggest that his fellow Loporrits would be best served by finding a dream they might aspire to, much as he once did. He eagerly agrees, and proposes the creation of a venue for providing inspiration to would-be dreamers. This, however, will require Livingway's permission before aught else."
5,"TEXT_BANLOP001_04681_SEQ_05","Though you lend your support to Dreamingway's petition, it appears that it was hardly needed, for Livingway herself has been much concerned with the matter of finding new activities for Loporrits at loose ends. Readily acquiescing to your proposal, she is quick to provide not only a space for Loporrit enrichment activities, but also two assistants with dreams of their own to share─Managingway and Coiningway. With no time to waste when so many exciting possibilities lie in store, your little group sets off to explore Hoper's Hold."
6,"TEXT_BANLOP001_04681_SEQ_06","You speak with Dreamingway, who is more than satisfied with what Hoper's Hold has to offer as a venue, and he suggests that you set to work posthaste. Managingway, fortunately, is quick to remind him that it is necessary to decide what one intends to build before building it─and thus are a musical stage and sales booth added neatly to the agenda. Now equipped with at least a general understanding of the task ahead, you set about crafting durable components to be used in construction."
7,"TEXT_BANLOP001_04681_SEQ_07","Managingway is more than satisfied with your carefully crafted components, which are swiftly rendered into the stage of Dreamingway's dreams. Before you know it, his music is drawing other Loporrits to Hoper's Hold. Though there is certainly much yet to be done, their smiling faces bode well for the future of your endeavor."
