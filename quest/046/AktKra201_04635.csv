1,"TEXT_AKTKRA201_04635_SEQ_01","Professor Claudien can scarcely contain his excitement as he informs you that the crystal has guided him to signs of another such memory repository that yet exists in the present day. He hastily departs to search for it, but not before asking you to make sure no further danger has visited Pandæmonium. A somewhat miffed Nemjiji, however, suggests first scouring the archives of Elpis for information on the failed creations interred within, that you might gain the upper hand in any future encounters."
2,"TEXT_AKTKRA201_04635_SEQ_02","You arrive at Peripeteia Krystalline to see Themis speaking with one of the archivists, seemingly for the same purpose as you. He offers to share his findings, but first asks that you accompany him to the beacon in Lethe, where he intends to meet an acquaintance that might shed further light upon the facility's mysteries."
3,"TEXT_AKTKRA201_04635_SEQ_03","Themis's acquaintance is in fact a member of the Words of Lahabrea, and their conversation reveals that while at first, Pandæmonium's researchers received creations from Elpis, over the years their focus shifted toward creations too flawed even to be considered for submission. Furthermore, the researcher informs you that a recent report from a keyward indicated that nothing is amiss in the facility. Knowing this to be a lie, Themis hurries to Asphodelos, where Erichthonios keeps a lone vigil."
4,"TEXT_AKTKRA201_04635_SEQ_04","As you reach the Gates of Pandæmonium, you are met with the sight of Erichthonios being held aloft by some unknown force. Themis dispels the bindings, and you observe their maker to be a familiar, who makes vaguely threatening utterances before vanishing, though thankfully without Erichthonios in tow."
5,"TEXT_AKTKRA201_04635_SEQ_05","Only the troubled-but-determined Erichthonios knows what transpired between him and Lahabrea moments ago. Fortunately, he seems more than happy to share the conclusion to which it has led him, should you but ask."
