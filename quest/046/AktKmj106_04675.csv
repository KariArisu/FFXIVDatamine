89,"TEXT_AKTKMJ106_04675_SYSTEM_000_120","The snowcraft is all but overflowing with ceruleum containers. However, several of your comrades have yet to arrive. Perhaps a nearby vantage point will afford you a more favorable view of their return."

96,"TEXT_AKTKMJ106_04675_VARSHAHNBIG_000_156","You have remained at my side and ever offered me support and encouragement. I haven't the words to thank you."
97,"TEXT_AKTKMJ106_04675_ALPHINAUD_000_160","I suppose this is where we part ways for now."
