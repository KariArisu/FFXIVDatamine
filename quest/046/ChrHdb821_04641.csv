1,"TEXT_CHRHDB821_04641_SEQ_01","In full knowledge of the fact that hijinks of subjective hilarity will ensue, you engage Nashu in conversation, who proceeds to regale you with her theory that Inspector Hildibrand has, in fact, been spirited away to the moon─a lead she attributes to the quote-unquote journalism of <Emphasis>The Thavnairian Truth</Emphasis>. Hoping to follow in the footsteps of Dorian, the editor in chief, as he chases his story into the heavens above, the irrepressible Nashu insists that you accompany her to Garlemald and its not-so-secret lunar portal."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDB821_04641_SEQ_02","After arriving in Camp Broken Glass, a shivering Nashu asks for the location of the portal in question. She trudges off in the direction of the Tower of Babil, and once again, in contravention of common sense, you feel compelled to follow."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDB821_04641_SEQ_03","In the Enceladeum you come upon an exasperated Delion attempting to convince the gatekeeper to allow him passage. Although you make no particular attempt to vouch for his character, the guard decides that Delion is sufficiently enmeshed in your efforts to find the abducted Hildibrand that special dispensation is warranted. Lucky you. Your party, now a mismatched trio, is free to proceed through the Nethergate..."
4,"TEXT_CHRHDB821_04641_SEQ_04","While Nashu admires the shiny white and decidedly inedible surface of the moon, Delion spies what he declares a “forward base.” You follow the alien-obsessed editor into the building, only to find him not-quite-speechless at the sight of the watcher and a visiting Loporrit. Although rightfully concerned by Delion's conspiracy-laden outbursts, the Loporrit nevertheless agrees to escort you to Bestways Burrow, where you can continue to gather information on the inspector's possible whereabouts."
5,"TEXT_CHRHDB821_04641_SEQ_05","Delion is, for a few blessed moments, stricken dumb by the sight of the burrow's expansive facilities. Alas, he recovers in time to join you and Nashu in questioning the local Loporrits.

8,"TEXT_CHRHDB821_04641_SEQ_08","Weavingway has no recollection of a gentleman in ragged clothes, but did spot an unidentified object flying in the south of Mare Lamentorum. As the incessant theorizing of Delion fades into background noise, you head outside to follow this most promising lead."
9,"TEXT_CHRHDB821_04641_SEQ_09","You catch sight of your shiny quarry and race off in pursuit, only stopping when you find a familiar pair of legs sticking up out of the ground. Then you spot another pair. And another. As if someone had sowed a field of inverted gentlemen. The Hildibrands free themselves, and, following a brief festival of masculinity, the alien vessel returns to reap the Mandervillian harvest─with extreme prejudice. Thankfully, the original Hildibrand is returned to you unharmed shortly thereafter by the craft's pilot─a short, blue, bipedal creature introduced to you as “Master PuPu.” Through the inspector's explanation and the impeccable timing of the Echo, you piece together the extraterrestrial's story, learning that PuPu has come from a distant star in search of his own missing comrade. In words that lean dangerously close to becoming a catchphrase, the impassioned Inspector Hildibrand vows to solve this latest case."
10,"TEXT_CHRHDB821_04641_SEQ_10","Your ability to communicate with PuPu has earned you the admiration of Hildibrand...and the unnerving attentions of Delion. If naught else, the new case in which you find yourself embroiled promises to be equal parts eventful and ludicrous indeed."
