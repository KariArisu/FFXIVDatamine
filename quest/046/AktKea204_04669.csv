1,"TEXT_AKTKEA204_04669_SEQ_01","Having extracted the information from her final stone, Krile rejoins you in Quarrymill. She expresses her thanks to her companions, mortal and divine alike, and together you make your way back to the Omphalos."
2,"TEXT_AKTKEA204_04669_SEQ_02","You arrive in the Omphalos to find G'raha Tia and Snoegeim already returned from their respective pilgrimages. After the gods take their leave, you use the information you acquired to complete the monument's epigraph. Appearing to be written by the gods themselves, it explains that they were brought forth by the will of the star, before going on to describe the duties of each deity. The revelations have given you and your companions much to ponder, and you all sink into contemplative silence."
3,"TEXT_AKTKEA204_04669_SEQ_03","G'raha Tia posits that the gods created the epigraph so that they might never lose sight of their duty, no matter how much their nature might be altered over millennia. And Krile, identifying the will of the star as Hydaelyn, turns her attention to the watcher on the moon, who could well be the thirteenth unnamed being.

As it stands, you have yet to encounter three of the Twelve, and there is no telling what may happen once you have fought them all. In order to determine how best to proceed, Krile and G'raha Tia decide to return to Sharlayan to compile your findings. Deryk also excuses himself and heads out of the Omphalos, but Snoegeim bids you follow after the aloof explorer, unsettled by his melancholy musings."
4,"TEXT_AKTKEA204_04669_SEQ_04","In response to Snoegeim's fears that he might suddenly vanish, Deryk philosophizes that all things must come to an end. Saddened though he will be when the time comes to part ways, he accepts that sadness as part of the joy he has derived from your companionship, and declares his intention to strive with you to the last. Inspired by his words, you inwardly pledge to follow the mystery of the Twelve to its very end."
