1,"TEXT_BANOMI006_04606_SEQ_01","With an ever-growing customer base and a wide variety of menu items to enjoy, the Last Dregs is poised to continue its operations in Ultima Thule for the next myriad or so years. To celebrate the lack of emergency spills and other sorts of impending doom, Jammingway invites you for a tasty beverage at the café.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANOMI006_04606_SEQ_02","No sooner do you arrive at the Last Dregs, of course, than does Jammingway come up with a task for you to perform─namely, asking the customers for an honest opinion of their experience. Hopefully no one will request you take their order."
3,"TEXT_BANOMI006_04606_SEQ_03","You speak with café patrons from various civilizations, who give universally positive reviews of the establishment. In large part due to your efforts, these once-despairing life-forms are now content in their post-replication existences."
4,"TEXT_BANOMI006_04606_SEQ_04","You report the happy news to Jammingway and
N-7000, who are pleased to hear of their customers' satisfaction. Your conversation is soon interrupted by a transmission from Stigma-4, however─it would seem that, without apparent cause, Elysion has transformed once again."
5,"TEXT_BANOMI006_04606_SEQ_05","Alongside your allied units, you arrive in Elysion to find it bursting with life─and also the Nibirun, for some reason. It transpires that they have explored all of Ultima Thule and understood its despair, but cannot comprehend the hope that permeates Elysion. After some discussion on the meaning of life, they are invited back to the café by a passing pair of Ea, where they may at last get a taste of happiness. At this end of the universe, after all, anything is possible."
