1,"TEXT_KINGMA118_04877_SEQ_01","Mindful of Wuk Lamat's exhausted state, Mablu offers to run ahead to the village and put on a pot of revitalizing mate tea. The others adopt a slower pace for the sake of the weakened Third Promise, leaving you free to lend Mablu a hand with teatime preparations."
2,"TEXT_KINGMA118_04877_SEQ_02","Wuk Lamat is feeling much recovered after her cup of tea, and confesses a newfound fondness for alpacas. As if on cue, Tobli arrives to inspect her captured beast, and declares that the Third Promise has met the requirements for accomplishing the Feat of Gold. When Wuk Lamat expresses her feelings of inferiority, however, the head ledger is prompted to share the story of Gulool Ja Ja's own visit to Wachunpelo many years ago, which culminated in the liberation of the Pelupelu from the Yok Huy.

Following this recitation, Tobli proceeds to award Wuk Lamat her keystone, urging her to be proud of her achievements in both the valley and the village itself. Mablu, grateful to Wuk Lamat for her encouragement, then announces to Tobli her desire to leave the ranch and take up the merchant profession─a desire which her adoptive father wholeheartedly endorses.

As you make to depart for Tuliyollal, Mablu suggests you speak with the Yok Huy about the legend of the golden city. According to local history, the giants once commanded the Pelupelu to search for the fabled metropolis. The revelations continue, as Mablu also recognizes Krile's earring, and offers to look into the origin of the jewelry which has long been worn as a charm of safe travel in Tural. After thanking her new Pelupelu friends for their advice and hospitality, Wuk Lamat sets her sights on the road back to the city."

4,"TEXT_KINGMA118_04877_SEQ_04","Now back in her home city, Wuk Lamat has regained her characteristic optimism. Hoping to maintain your momentum, you prepare to embark on the next stage of the contest."
