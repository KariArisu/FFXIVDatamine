Wounded in the battle with the thieves, Nyipine bids you travel to Limsa Lominsa in his stead and serve as the healing hand that can save the Heartsting's potential victims. Loashkana─the village elder's daughter─has but recently journeyed to Eorzea in pursuit of the treasure, sailing on a ship captained by a woman named Bhaldbryda.
