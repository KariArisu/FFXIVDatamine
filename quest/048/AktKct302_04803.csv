1,"TEXT_AKTKCT302_04803_SEQ_01","Well aware of the myriad challenges that await them, Grenoldt and Chora-Zoi are quick to resume discussions on the splendorous tools' improvement. Grenoldt asserts that this new creation requires a bold design to usher in a new age of trade for Norvrandt, yet it must retain the tools' well-loved adaptive properties. As ever, the Boutique is willing to part with extraordinary components from Qeshi-Trao's collection, but no rarity comes without its price, and you are tasked once again with the procurement of quality trade goods.

※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_AKTKCT302_04803_SEQ_02","Your hard-earned goods serve as the catalyst for the newest splendorous tool─forged with shards from the Crystal Tower and wrapped with the selfsame iron utilized in the Crystarium's architecture. Chora-Zoi proudly urges you to take it in your hands, and as you hold your newest creation, you are filled with an overwhelming sense of pride. The tools will surely aid in Norvrandt's rebirth, and in crafting it, you have given the once-blighted world yet another reason to hope."
