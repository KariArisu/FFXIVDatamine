1,"TEXT_KINGMB115_04894_SEQ_01","Erenville has recalibrated the aether seeker to track Valigarmanda's unique aetheric signature. After beeping excitedly, the device speeds off into the distance, leaving you with little choice but to hurry on after it."
2,"TEXT_KINGMB115_04894_SEQ_02","The aether seeker leads you to another burning crater. Satisfied that the device is now locked onto the correct aetherial aspect, Erenville adjusts the threshold for aetheric concentration. With any luck, this change in parameters should allow you to follow the invisible trail of Valigarmanda itself."
3,"TEXT_KINGMB115_04894_SEQ_03","Your pursuit of the Skyruin pauses briefly outside the Indelible Passage. The seeker points forward, indicating your quarry must be somewhere on the other side of the tunnel ahead."
4,"TEXT_KINGMB115_04894_SEQ_04","Though the aether trail comes to an end, Erenville is confident Valigarmanda is headed towards Worqor Lar Dor. You assemble your companions, but barely manage to take a step in the direction of the many-colored mountain when Vorporlor appears and forbids you from trespassing on their sacred site.

The standoff only intensifies when Wuk Lamat's brothers arrive to offer their assistance, and it takes an earnest reminder from one of Vorporlor's own underlings to persuade the giant to allow the hunting party to pass. Your numbers now bolstered by the First and Second Promise, you set forth to slay the thousand-year-old menace spoken of in fear and immortalized in stone─Valigarmanda, the Skyruin!

※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
5,"TEXT_KINGMB115_04894_SEQ_05","The battlefield heaves and cracks under an onslaught of raging fire, bone-chilling ice, and incandescent lightning. Yet you emerge from this maelstrom of elemental fury victorious─Valigarmanda, the legendary tural vidraal, is no more."
6,"TEXT_KINGMB115_04894_SEQ_06","Initially elated at besting the monster even her father could not slay, Wuk Lamat is soon sobered by Koana's more realistic appraisal of your accomplishment. A few carefully chosen words from you, however, soon have the Third Promise resolving to surpass her old man in the future. Exhausted yet triumphant, the party heads off to reunite with the waiting Erenville."
7,"TEXT_KINGMB115_04894_SEQ_07","Stoic as ever, Erenville betrays no surprise at your success against the Skyruin. As for the First Promise, the gleaner claims that Zoraal Ja seemed disinclined to linger for any celebrations of your victory."
