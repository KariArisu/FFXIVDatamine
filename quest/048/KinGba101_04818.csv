1,"TEXT_KINGBA101_04818_SEQ_01","The forlorn woman introduces herself as Loazenikwe, and explains that a precious treasure known as the Cradle of the Sleepless was stolen from her village. Housing the soul of a narwhal which became a tural vidraal, this object can transfer the wielder's fatigue to another, granting the former unflagging vitality and lulling the latter into an irresistible slumber. A man named Tentoawa, mightiest warrior of their village, has crossed the sea to recover the sacred item, and Loazenikwe asks you to follow him to Ishgard and protect him during his search. You agree to journey to that snowbound city, and Loazenikwe suggests asking around its taverns for a young man with blue hair."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA101_04818_SEQ_02","Knowing that every piece of gossip in Ishgard flows through the Forgotten Knight, you ask its proprietor if he's heard tell of anyone who might fit Tentoawa's description. While reticent at first, Gibrillont eventually admits that a young man from a far-off land was asking around about a stolen object. While the tavern's patrons couldn't point him in the right direction, Gibrillont informs you that he sent the youth to the Jeweled Crozier, and suggests going there if you wish to find him."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA101_04818_SEQ_03","The distinct attire of Tentoawa makes him easy to find among the crowds of the Jeweled Crozier, and after you explain to him who you are, he readily accepts your help. He describes the thief as an Elezen with a distinct scar, whose deadly grace belied a martial prowess unbefitting of the scholarly robes she disguised herself in. After hearing this you conclude that she might be known among the knights of the Congregation, and Tentoawa wastes no time in deciding that the barracks will be your next destination."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA101_04818_SEQ_04","Your intuition proves correct, as Firmalbert confesses that your description matches that of a former knight named Leophyne, who was expelled from the Temple Knights in shame. Knowing that she will only commit further misdeeds, Firmalbert pledges to share your story with his superiors so that they might come up with a plan to catch the disgraced knight. Firmalbert says he will inform you of any developments, and Tentoawa wishes to discuss what to do next."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA101_04818_SEQ_05","While you must wait until the Temple Knights uncover anything of value before acting, Tentoawa does not intend to remain idle. He declares his intention to learn all that he can of Ishgard and its ways, and asks that you remain alert and ready to act when word comes of Leophyne's whereabouts.

※The next role quest will be available from Tentoawa upon reaching level 92 in any tank class."
