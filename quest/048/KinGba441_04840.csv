1,"TEXT_KINGBA441_04840_SEQ_01","Ceetol Ja has received a letter from an unknown sender requesting that you travel to the Ala Mhigan Quarter incognito to meet with a man wearing glasses. Though you have every reason to expect foul play, there is also the possibility that your contacts within Chalteaufite's gang are attempting to reach you, so you decide to follow the instructions."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA441_04840_SEQ_02","Ceetol Ja has prepared a disguise for you to pass through the crowds without drawing attention. With only the barest of descriptions to go by, you begin your search for the bespectacled man.

※You must be wearing the disguise to complete this task."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA441_04840_SEQ_03","Having found a man wearing glasses, you are relieved to discover he is indeed the person you seek, and not simply one of the many, many other male spectacle-wearers in Ala Mhigo. He goes on to explain that there is someone he wishes you to meet, though you must remain incognito for the time being.

※You must be wearing the disguise to complete this task."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA441_04840_SEQ_04","The person you are brought to meet is none other than Kaqool Ja. He relays the tale of his attempt to confront Chalteaufite and retrieve the Steelhog Vessel, the power of which proved too difficult an obstacle to overcome. Luckily, he escaped with only minor injuries, and he was able to learn of Chalteaufite's plan to conquer Ala Mhigo, with the palace as the most likely first target. Before you depart, he asks that you share his story with Ceetol Ja, so that the young Mamool Ja might form a plan to retrieve her people's artifact."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA441_04840_SEQ_05","You convey to Ceetol Ja all you have learned. Considering the threat to Ala Mhigo, she decides it is high time to inform the Resistance and seek its aid. With a battle against a seemingly invincible foe looming on the horizon, you set about preparing as best you can.

※The next role quest will be available from Ceetol Ja upon reaching level 100 in any physical ranged DPS class."
