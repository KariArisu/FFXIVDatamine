1,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_SEQ_01","Tepeke is in high spirits, for she but recently received news that her father has awakened and has traveled to Tuliyollal. While she wants nothing more than to go there and seek his wise counsel, she has already committed to helping the Radiant Host search for Virazahn. She asks you to go to Tuliyollal in her stead to seek her father out, suggesting that her mother Tsuuhe can tell you his whereabouts."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_SEQ_02","While slightly surprised that her daughter is not at your side, Tsuuhe is nonetheless glad to see you. She informs you that her husband Nettse has indeed arrived in Tuliyollal, and spends his days trying to find information that can aid his daughter from afar. If you wish to find him, Tsuuhe tells you to go to the Pyariyoanaan Plain, where he is engaged in a search for vital clues."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_SEQ_03","You search the Pyariyoanaan Plain until you come upon a man being attacked by a ferocious owl. After dispatching it, you see that he wears the characteristic accoutrements of a magic user. Help him get back on his feet."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_SEQ_04","Luckily, the man is not seriously hurt, and you soon find out he is indeed Nettse. You exchange stories about all that has transpired since Virazahn absconded with the treasure. He shares with you a theory that the owl tural vidraal within the Perch of the Apex activates its power when it senses danger, and also relates a forgotten legend that details its fate. You should return to Radz–at–Han to share this new information with Tepeke."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_SEQ_05","Back in Radz–at–Han, Tepeke hurriedly informs you that Virazahn has been sighted nearby. You rush to his location just in time to catch another of his grand speeches, in which he denounces the rumors of wrongdoing and declares his intent to become king. Those present are nonplussed by his theatrics, which are then interrupted by the appearance of his father. The merchant pleads with his son to give up and turn himself over to the Radiant Host, but Virazahn unleashes the treasure's power, bringing rocks hurtling from the sky. He then leaves, declaring that he shall soon challenge you to a battle. As you watch your quarry go, Tepeke turns your attention to the aftermath, and particularly Virazahn's father."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_SEQ_06","Virazahn's father is unharmed, and Tepeke asks him to explain Virazahn's odd expression after the rocks fell. He says that it was often worn by Virazahn when he was scolded or otherwise forced to stop playing make-believe. While it is worrying that such a childish pretender has possession of the Perch of the Apex, Tepeke knows the only course of action is to return to Yedlihmad, where she can finally hear of your journey to Tural."
7,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_SEQ_07","Tepeke admits that her father's theory corresponds with Virazahn's actions and thinks that perhaps the old legend hints that the tural vidraal's power increased in proportion to the danger it sensed. This explains Virazahn's eagerness to face you in battle, but Tepeke means to take advantage of his arrogance and overwhelm him with sheer magical power. She only needs to find a suitable place for an epic duel, a task for which she will recruit the Radiant Host's aid. In the meantime, prepare yourself for a battle worthy of legend.

※The next role quest will be available from Tepeke upon reaching level 100 in any magical ranged DPS class."

64,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_053","Since arriving in Tuliyollal, I've done what I can to shed light upon the tural vidraal sealed within the treasure."
65,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_054","After the nations of Tural were unified, some left our village to build new homes in the city. I've sought them out to see if they know anything of use."
66,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_055","Unfortunately, none could offer insight into the treasure's magicks, but one of them told me that owls lurked around this place."
67,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_056","And since the tural vidraal sealed within the Perch of the Apex was once an owl, it seemed logical to pursue such a quarry."
68,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_057","I thought perhaps I could glean something about the ancient beast from their behavior. Like as not, some fundamental aspects remain the same even after transformation."
69,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_058","But having heard your account, there is one fundamental <Emphasis>difference</Emphasis> that stands out. As far as I'm aware, no owl native to these lands possesses the ability to hurl rocks, large or otherwise. No doubt the tural vidraal gained this power following its metamorphosis."
70,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_059","I do believe, however, that it would retain an owl's core instincts. That one you fought didn't strike unprovoked─instead, it watched me from afar with fear in its eyes."
71,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_060","While this is normal behavior for most animals, I was surprised by how suddenly it descended upon me the moment I started approaching."

73,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_A1_000_200","It sensed danger and attacked preemptively."
74,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_A2_000_200","Maybe owls prefer to fight rather than run."
75,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_061","I had the same thought. The owl sensed a threat and chose to confront it rather than run from it. And this same impulse may have driven the tural vidraal..."
76,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_062","Indeed, that correlates with something I heard from one of my countrymen who had relocated to Tuliyollal. He spoke of a continuation to the tales passed down from the elders."
77,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_063","“No hunter's arrow could fell the apex. It was struck down in a storm of its own wrath, made wild by a heart affright. Thus was it sealed away at last.”"
78,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_064","Now, judging from the owls' behavior, I can theorize that the treasure is activated when its bearer senses danger. And according to the story, this power can easily get out of hand if its bearer is panicked."
79,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_066","Of course, this theory must be tested first. Virazahn will certainly use the Perch of the Apex again. When he does, I ask that you and Tepeke pay special attention to the circumstances leading to its activation."
80,"TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_NETTSE_000_067","You have my thanks. Loath though I am to admit it, I've yet to recover from my long convalescence, and I would only be a burden to you. I wish I could aid my daughter another way, but you more than make up for my absence."
