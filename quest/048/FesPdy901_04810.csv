※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_01","As dependably as eggs fall from a laying hen, this year's Hatching–tide festivities are being overseen by none other than Jihli Aliapoh, whose ambitions extend further than ever before. She describes to you her dream of a goobbue upon a stage in Ul'dah, and details her plan to hold a tandem celebration of both Hatching–tide and Little Ladies' Day which will spread joy across two of Eorzea's city-states. However, she must first convince the planners of Little Ladies' Day that the goobbue performer she hired poses no danger to the people. The royal seneschal has traveled from Ul'dah on behalf of his peers, and Jihli has instructed you both to visit Bentbranch Meadows, where the goobbue is even now delivering joy to all and sundry.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

She must first win the hearts of the people of Gridania, however, and for that Aldemund requires your aid. It seems Peatie suffers from a minor case of stage fright, and Aldemund would have you ride on the goobbue's head to reassure her as she delivers smiles to the people."
3,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_03","Peatie shows no sign of discontent as you mount her head. Now, the people of Gridania await to have the spirit of Hatching–tide stirred within them."
4,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_04","The sound of cheers can be heard reverberating throughout Bentbranch Meadows, a clear indication of Peatie's successful performance. Aldemund will undoubtedly wish to hear of this favorable outcome."
5,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_05","You arrive to see Aldemund's store of eggs depleted─a true sign that Peatie's show made a splash. Although Aldemund believes her place on Ul'dah's stage is secured, the final decision comes down to the judgment of the royal seneschal."

64,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_BUTLER_000_024","The trepidation is not without cause, mind you. Some fifteen years ago, a supposedly tame goobbue ran amok in the city streets, causing untold harm."

85,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_054","I've been watchin' over her ever since the day I found her wanderin' the wilderness all by her lonesome. We spent ages lookin' for her family, but now I s'pose we're all each other has."
86,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_BUTLER_000_055","Peatie? A lovely name, to be sure. And those flowers, are they peach blossoms? I daresay she is the very picture of a Little Ladies' Day princess!"
87,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_056","Haha, I'm glad to hear that, and I know Peatie is, too. She's thought of little else since the moment Miss Aliapoh came to us with her peculiar request."
88,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_057","There's nothin' in this world we love more than hearin' an audience cheer, and I think this time we'll earn that and then some. We call this one “egg surprise.” Go on, Peatie!"

90,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_059","Impressive, ain't it? And all it took was a few glamour prisms. 'Course, that wasn't where the genius was required."

92,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_062","Now here comes the rub. Ever since we arrived in Gridania, Peatie's been a little on edge. Hate to see her like this, but I think I've figured out what's causin' it."
93,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_063","As you just saw, she's got no problem performin' in front of an audience of two. But when a whole gaggle of revelers showed up not too long ago, she just froze up."
94,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_BUTLER_000_064","I see... She must not be used to such large crowds."
95,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_065","Luckily, I managed to save the show by climbin' atop her head. That set her mind at ease and helped her find her courage."
96,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_100_065","But I ain't as young as I used to be, and my knees are already cryin' out in protest at the prospect of climbin' her again."

98,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_067","All you have to do is climb atop her and head toward the crowds. Show them our act, and tell the spectators to come to me for an egg of their own. Still plenty to go around."
99,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_BUTLER_000_070","If Peatie's act is a hit in Gridania, it would do much to allay the concerns of my Ul'dahn compatriots. Best of luck, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
