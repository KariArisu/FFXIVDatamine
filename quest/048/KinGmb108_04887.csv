49,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_002","Firstly, allow me to brief everyone on our present situation."
50,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_003","...Thus, at the very least, we believe this Hoobigo knows where Lamaty'i has been taken. Thancred is shadowing their boat even as we speak, and I should like to join him with all haste."
51,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_004","Unfortunately, our quarry had the foresight to release your punutiy from its harness, leaving us without a means to give pursuit."
52,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_005","Erenville. As an expert on wildlife, what are our chances of recapturing the beast?"
53,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_006","With the right mix of feed, it can be done. I should like an extra hand to help scatter it about, however."
54,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_007","Would you accompany him, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
55,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_008","Meanwhile, the rest of us should work on getting the harness repaired. It appears to have been damaged when the punutiy was let loose..."
56,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ALPHINAUD_000_009","With all the peddlers here in camp, we should have little trouble purchasing replacement materials. As for any necessary metalwork, Earthenshire's artisans are but a short walk away."
57,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_010","Then let us divide the tasks and have at it."
58,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_011","There was an unusually aggressive herd of wild punutiys downriver, so our girl will have fled in the opposite direction. Come, we'll try the waters upriver."
59,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_020","Assuming our punutiy has come this way, she'll be hiding in the depths of Marsh Ligaka. We'll need to lure her back to the shallows with the promise of food."
60,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_021","Wild punutiys eat mainly aquatic grasses and plants, but the tame ones are often fed vegetable scraps."
61,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_022","Knowing this, I added leftovers to the feed I've prepared. This should help the mixture stand out against the marsh's natural scents."
62,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_023","Ligaka is crawling with predators, however, so I'll leave it to you to scatter feed deeper in. I'll be waiting for you near the shallows with the rest of our punutiy's enticing feast."
63,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_030","Come and let me know once you've scattered the feed."
64,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_SYSTEM_000_031","You scatter Erenville's punutiy feed along the water's edge."
65,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_035","All set? I've just finished laying out the last of the bait. Step back out of sight and leave the rest to me."
66,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_040","Here she is."
67,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_041","Shhh, there's nothing to be afraid of. We just need your help one last time."
68,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_042","You're hungry, I wager. Come on, come with me."
69,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_043","Yes, there's a good girl."
70,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_044","We'll be fine here, I think. I'll give her a few more treats, then lead her over to the boat. You can let Koana know we have our punutiy back."
71,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_ERENVILLE_000_050","Shhh, everything's alright now. Being alone in a strange river must have been frightening for you..."
72,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_PUNUTEE04885_000_051","Mew..."
73,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_SYSTEM_000_052","The punutiy seems comforted by Erenville's scent."
74,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_053","Erenville has the punutiy in hand, then? Good. I expected nothing less from a certified gleaner."
75,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_054","As for the harness, we were able to purchase all the parts we need. The Leveilleur twins are over in Earthenshire right now, having the potsworn make the repairs."
76,"TEXT_KINGMB108_04887_KOANA_000_055","I'm told it shouldn't take long. We'll be ready to embark on our rescue mission as soon as we hear from Thancred."
