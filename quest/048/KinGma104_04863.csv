51,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_200_006","But if you take a <Emphasis>really</Emphasis> good look, you'll see they're something much more interesting!"

56,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_011","They seem to tell a series of stories, many of them featuring a two-headed Mamool Ja. Oh! Then this must be..."
57,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_012","That's right. It follows the exploits of my father, Gulool Ja Ja, and his journey to unite our lands. We call it the Tuliyollal Saga!"
58,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_013","The deeds he performed and the bonds he forged, all immortalized in stone."
59,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_014","There's no better way to learn how Tuliyollal came to be. Study them as long as you like!"
60,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_020","The four stones closest to us cover the first half of Papa's travels. Let's start with those."
61,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_021","If you're done with the first half, we can move on to the second!"

66,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_030","This pillar tells the Lay of the Brotherhood. It depicts the scene where Papa granted an audience to the foreign explorer, Ket...something. I can never remember the name."
67,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_031","You mean “Ketenramm”?"
68,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_032","Ah, that's the one. Ketenramm's arrival in Tural is what prompted Papa to embark on his own journey."
69,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_033","It's said the two grew to be close friends─brothers in spirit, if not in blood. But no one knows what became of the explorer in later years."
70,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_034","Ketenramm's disappearance is a mystery in Eorzea as well. The records say he traveled between our lands and yours for a while, but then it's assumed he was lost at sea."
71,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_035","This one recounts the Lay of Repast. As you can probably tell, the figure depicted here is of the Xbr'aal, like me."
72,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_036","For decades, the Xbr'aal and the Mamool Ja were at war for control of the forest of Yak T'el."
73,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_037","The actions Papa took to end that conflict have since been hailed as the first steps in the founding of Tuliyollal."
74,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_038","There is a clan of Hrothgar in Bozja known as Helions. In their society, the women rule as queens, and the men serve as devoted subjects."
75,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_039","Yet here in Tural, Xbr'aal men and women appear to be of equal status. How dramatically culture can vary with location."
76,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_040","Here we have the Lay of Reeds. This is the story of when Papa visited the Hanuhanu in their village in Kozama'uka."
77,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_041","Ah, the people Alphinaud almost mistook for Vanu Vanu, if not for the colorful plumage. He spent a fair bit of time among the Vanu in the Sea of Clouds, so it's no surprise he took an interest in your countrymen."
78,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_042","I don't know how it is with your Vanu, but our Hanu are a bright and cheerful sort. They hold this one festival every year─very famous, and a lot of fun."
79,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_043","Uh, let's see... This one is the Lay of Pots, which depicts the Moblins of Kozama'uka."
80,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_044","They might wear odd masks and sound weirdly muffled when they talk, but the gold- and silverwork they sell is the best you'll find anywhere. Moblin goods are the standard when it comes to gift giving."
81,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_045","Clearly the Vanu aren't the only people with distant Turali counterparts..."
82,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_046","The Lay of Gold. This pillar shows one of the Pelupelu, whose homeland is in Urqopacha."
83,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_047","Having created our currency, the Pelu are rightfully known as the merchant clan. They oversee Tuliyollal's markets, and their traveling peddlers are a common sight no matter where you go in Tural."
84,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_048","Don't let their size fool you! They might be mistaken as children, but beneath those beaked masks, they are clever and calculating traders."
85,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_049","Ah, the Lay of Proof... That big fellow is of the Yok Huy, the largest of Tural's peoples."
86,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_050","These giants once used their great size and strength to establish a dominion encompassing all of Yok Tural."
87,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_051","Having brought the southern reaches to heel, they then turned northwards, setting their sights on Xak Tural. You'll recall that massive bridge they built beyond the skygate..."
88,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_052","Some time after launching their northern campaign, however, they just...gave up. They abandoned the lands they'd conquered and withdrew into the mountains of Urqopacha. I've never even seen any of their kind so much as set foot in the city."
89,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_053","This was a people with the power and resourcefulness to raise a temple on a mountaintop and build a bridge across the sea with stone. What would move them to renounce their ambitions and their place in Turali history...?"
90,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_054","Oh, this one is my favorite: the Lay of Ice. It depicts the battle with the legendary tural vidraal, Valigarmanda!"
91,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_055","I should explain. A tural vidraal is a creature that has lived far beyond its usual lifespan and awakened to preternatural power."
92,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_056","Tataru described the Far Eastern auspices in a similar fashion. Could this be the same phenomenon?"
93,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_057","Valigarmanda itself was dubbed the Skyruin, a name earned for the destruction and terror it visited upon Tural every time it stirred from its slumber."
94,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_058","But eighty years or so ago, its ruinous reign was brought to an end! After a great struggle, Papa and his comrades managed to overcome the raging vidraal, and sealed it away in the Urqopacha mountains."
95,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_059","Despite its reputation, however, Valigarmanda is also a symbol of power. That's why you'll see its likeness on Tuliyollal's national emblem, and adorning the banners at the palace."
96,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_060","Oh, this one is unmarked."
97,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_061","Papa says he left a blank pillar for the next chapter of Tuliyollal's history. Whatever that might be."
98,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_062","Well, there you have it. I trust that gave you a better understanding of our nation. If you want to review anything, just let me know."
99,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
100,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_A1_000_001","I think I have a decent grasp."
101,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_A1_000_002","Maybe another quick look..."
102,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_064","Glad to hear it!"
103,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_065","You know, I feel awfully hungry all of a sudden... No surprises there seeing I couldn't keep anything down for a while. But now I think I'm ready to eat again!"
104,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_066","So let's go and have ourselves a bite of a local delicacy! Come, I'll take you to the best restaurant in the city!"
105,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_067","I like the sound of that!"
106,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_068","Of course! Take as much time as you need!"
107,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_069","Had your fill of history, then?"
108,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
109,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_A2_000_001","Yes, thank you!"
110,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_A2_000_002","Maybe one more look."
111,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_080","What a lovely establishment. I'm reminded of the Bismarck in Limsa Lominsa."
112,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_090","Have you ever had tacos? They're a Tuliyollal classic! You bake a crunchy shell made from corn flour, and fill it with meat and salad."
113,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_091","A lot of shops and stalls sell them, but I like how they're made here at Xbalyav Ty'e best."
114,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_092","And I need one right in front of me, right now! Let's head downstairs and place an order with old Br'uk Evu!"
115,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_100","This is Br'uk Evu, the owner. Don't let his unassuming appearance fool you─when it comes to making tacos, he is the greatest artisan in all of Tural!"
116,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_105","Every dish looks delicious! At the risk of sounding like Wuk Lamat, the mere sight of so much fine cuisine is making me ravenous."
117,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_110","Br'uk Evu's lovingly made tacos went to waste, and it's all that brutish Bakool Ja Ja's fault..."
118,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_120","I was looking forward to trying some authentic Tuliyollal cuisine, but we should hurry and join Alphinaud and the others at the palace."
119,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_121","All right. It's a bit of a climb to the top, but you can head up from the Resplendent Quarter, or even the eastern side of Talonmarch, if you prefer."
120,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_122","Now that you have an idea of how the city's laid out, I'll let you find your own way to Vollok Shoonsa."

122,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_ERENVILLE_000_130","Do you have a better feel for the city now?"
123,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_KRILE_000_135","There are so many narrow, winding streets. But even if you get lost, all you have to do is keep heading up, and you'll arrive at the palace eventually."
124,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_ALPHINAUD_000_140","We saw a two-headed Mamool Ja on our way here. Another claimant in the rite of succession, according to Erenville."
125,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_ALISAIE_000_145","The food is amazing. A passing Mamool Ja let us try a fruit called “cherimoya” and it was just sublime."
126,"TEXT_KINGMA104_04863_WUKLAMAT_000_150","You made it. Good. Then we're all here."
