110,"TEXT_KINGMB113_04892_KRILE_000_143","So, we have the reliable─yet slow─method of information gathering, versus the potentially swift─but easily misled─gleaner tool. I say why not pursue both methods at the same time?"

113,"TEXT_KINGMB113_04892_ALISAIE_000_146","The rest of us can stay behind and talk to eyewitnesses. The more Skyruin sightings we can compare, the more accurate our information will be."
