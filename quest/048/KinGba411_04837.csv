1,"TEXT_KINGBA411_04837_SEQ_01","Ceetol Ja calls over a Resistance soldier with whom she had previously discussed the bandits you seek. He explains that their leader Chalteaufite is a member of a larger organization known as the Passage of the Unbound, which has been wreaking havoc throughout Eorzea. Among their preferred targets are the trade caravans that travel between Gridania and Ala Mhigo, with one such incident having recently occurred near Porta Praetoria. The troops stationed there should be able to provide further details."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA411_04837_SEQ_02","Shortly after introducing yourselves to the Resistance commander at Porta Praetoria, you are interrupted by an extremely talkative merchant and his colleagues. Having heard rumors of raids on caravans in the surrounding area, the trader suggests accompanying his comrades to a location where the bandits have been known to strike."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA411_04837_SEQ_03","Arriving at the entrance to a gully, the two merchants elect to stay behind while you go on ahead to investigate the scene of the crime. Though you may not necessarily run into any trouble, you had best be prepared for it all the same."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA411_04837_SEQ_04","Your sense that danger lurks around any corner is proven correct, as you are soon ambushed by a small group of bandits. While they would doubtless pose a threat to the average traveler, they reckoned without the prowess of the Warrior of Light, and you waste no time in incapacitating your foes."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA411_04837_SEQ_05","Upon returning to your two guides, they contact their leader, who soon arrives at your location with the Porta Praetoria commander and Ceetol Ja in tow. As the Resistance member goes to apprehend the bandits, the merchants say their good-byes and continue their journey to Ala Mhigo, seemingly in somewhat of a hurry. For the time being, you and Ceetol Ja decide it best to return to Porta Praetoria."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA411_04837_SEQ_06","With the highwaymen now in custody and undergoing questioning, Ceetol Ja chooses to wait at Porta Praetoria to see if any useful information can be gleaned. Expecting the interrogation to go on for some time, you take the opportunity to rest after your eventful excursion.

※The next role quest will be available from Ceetol Ja upon reaching level 94 in any physical ranged DPS class."
