※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_CHRHDY401_04806_SEQ_01","His jubilant attitude somewhat subdued in the presence of his beloved wife Julyan and her critical eye, Godbert shares with you the key to perfecting the legendary Manderville weapons: the oil known as Ultramanderville. The lubricant's main ingredient is apparently derived from yet another meteoritic material which, once again, is available from your usual tomestone-hungry vendor.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.

※Chunks of cosmic crystallite can be obtained from Jubrunnah at the aetheryte plaza in Radz–at–Han."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDY401_04806_SEQ_02","Much to Gerolt's initial disbelief, extracting the crystallite's aetherial essence is achieved through the medium of gentlemanly motion─specifically the resonant waveforms created by a collaborative Manderville dance. From there, it is a simple matter of reshaping the weaponry, then coating it with a carefully measured mixture of Ultramanderville. The result of this process serves to unlock a final recording stored in Godbert's reclaimed relic, and you are treated to a congratulatory message from the eccentric Godbrand. Moved by Godbrand's earnest plea and convinced by her husband's purity of purpose, Julyan elects to approve the continued financing of the Manderville weapon project. Godbert thanks you once more for your contributions, and bids you refine new armaments as you see fit. After all, one can spare no expense when investing in a peaceful future."
