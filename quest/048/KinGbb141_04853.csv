1,"TEXT_KINGBB141_04853_SEQ_01","Keshkwa has been on tenterhooks waiting for the Twin Adders to share any information concerning Iq Soq Xmajun. As luck would have it, Golias's commanding officer has requested a meeting at the Adders' Nest, seemingly with important news to relay."
2,"TEXT_KINGBB141_04853_SEQ_02","The Twin Adder officer recounts details of attacks by Iq Soq Xmajun, most likely orchestrated by Innocent Stork. In addition, the Adders have received a letter from Golias, in which he formally requests to resign from the organization. Even more surprising is a message for you and Keshkwa, which seems to be a coded plea for help, suggesting that Iq Soq Xmajun is currently somewhere in southern Thanalan. The officer observes that the true message cannot have escaped Innocent Stork's notice, and that the fact she allowed it to be sent means you are almost certainly walking into a trap. Keshkwa is undeterred, however, welcoming any opportunity to confront and kill the vidraal. The two of you depart for the Sagolii Desert to begin your search for Innocent Stork and her newfound pet."
3,"TEXT_KINGBB141_04853_SEQ_03","The trail leads straight to Innocent Stork, with Iq Soq Xmajun waiting obediently at her side. Lying at her feet is a motionless Golias, who appears to be the beast's latest victim. A heated battle with Iq Soq Xmajun ensues, during which Keshkwa deduces its subdued behavior to be related to a pouch of wildgrass the entrepreneur is carrying to keep Iq Soq Xmajun in check─though the viper remains convinced their alliance will not last. Sure enough, when Golias's sudden recovery draws Innocent Stork's attention and forces her to turn her back to Iq Soq Xmajun, it seizes the opportunity to rid itself of its supposed master. With the unwanted nuisance removed, the tural vidraal unleashes its full might, though in the end it is you and your mentor that emerge victorious."
4,"TEXT_KINGBB141_04853_SEQ_04","With Iq Soq Xmajun slain, Keshkwa has finally succeeded in avenging his fallen comrade. Although the immediate threat has been quelled, you have yet to ascertain why Golias was assisting Innocent Stork in her diabolical schemes."
5,"TEXT_KINGBB141_04853_SEQ_05","Golias admits to having been coerced into aiding Innocent Stork, who used his position within the Twin Adders to obtain sensitive information. However, as Innocent Stork had threatened to unleash her creatures upon Gridania and his family should he fail to comply, Golias believed that his subterfuge was necessary in order to protect everyone. Regardless, this is a matter for the Twin Adders, so you escort Golias to Quarrymill to meet with his commanding officer."
6,"TEXT_KINGBB141_04853_SEQ_06","Golias's misdeeds will not soon be forgotten, and his expulsion from the Twin Adders is a foregone conclusion. However, Keshkwa's heartfelt plea on his behalf persuades the commanding officer to show a measure of leniency, and so no charges will be brought against the disgraced soldier. Keshkwa then asks for his help finding clients in need of a hunter, as your mentor will need to earn sufficient money to pay for passage back to Tural. For the time being at least, Golias will be able to pursue his dream of protecting innocent people from rampaging beasts, while Keshkwa will remain in Eorzea a little longer. Now that the matter of Iq Soq Xmajun is well and truly resolved, you are free to seek out clients of your own, and offer those in peril the skills of a viper."
