1,"TEXT_KINGMB102_04881_SEQ_01","Rakorok has found himself in charge of the potsworn Kaahe but has no idea what the artisan might want or need to be more comfortable in Earthenshire. Warning that helphands do not question potsworn directly, the overworked Moblin bids you and Wuk Lamat observe Kaahe and attempt to ascertain his desires."
2,"TEXT_KINGMB102_04881_SEQ_02","You enter the workshop and note several things that could be affecting Kaahe's ability to concentrate on his work. After having a thorough look around, you and Wuk Lamat head back outside to share your observations with Rakorok."
3,"TEXT_KINGMB102_04881_SEQ_03","Wuk Lamat notes three factors that are likely hindering Kaahe's creative endeavors. The first of these is the artisan's piping hot meals, which the average Hhetsarro would not appreciate and which Wuk Lamat will discuss with the Moblin's cook. The second is the state of Kaahe's tools─an oversight which Rakorok is only too happy to correct. The third concerns the sweltering heat inside the Workpot, which you are tasked to alleviate by salvaging a “draftyshard” from nearby boat wrecks. According to Rakorok, you should be able to spot the tunnel to the shoals in question from just outside the village."
4,"TEXT_KINGMB102_04881_SEQ_04","Your search for the tunnel entrance is briefly interrupted by Koana and Thancred, who are out gathering herbs for treating the injured Moblins. Musing on the tenuous situation in Earthenshire, Koana seems preoccupied with the ways Sharlayan technology could improve the lives of his people. After the two depart, you soon spy the rocky passage you were looking for─southeast of the village, as Rakorok described."
5,"TEXT_KINGMB102_04881_SEQ_05","You wade through the shallows and pluck a wind-aspected crystal from the scattered wreckage in the shoals. With “draftyshard” in hand, you can now return to Earthenshire and the waiting Rakorok."
6,"TEXT_KINGMB102_04881_SEQ_06","Invigorated by your offerings of fine food, new tools, and a soothing breeze, Kaahe immediately sets to work crafting an exquisite oil lamp. Koana then arrives to inform Wuk Lamat of the feat's imminent commencement, and cannot help but be impressed by the potsworn's work. Rakorok, too, seems well pleased with Kaahe's dramatic change of attitude."
7,"TEXT_KINGMB102_04881_SEQ_07","Wuk Lamat agrees with the grateful Rakorok that it is important to know as much as you can about the people you want to help. With that lesson fresh in mind, you prepare yourselves to face the impending Feat of Pots."
