1,"TEXT_AKTKCT301_04802_SEQ_01","With yet another accomplishment under their belts, Chora-Zoi and Grenoldt are keen to begin their final rounds of improvements to the splendorous tools. Grenoldt, however, admits that he has more than the forge on his mind─his enduring love for Mowen can be contained no longer, and he wishes to propose to her upon their next meeting. With assistance from Quinnana, you and Chora-Zoi conceive of a strategy to aid Grenoldt in his marital quest, and make for the Exedra to set the plan in motion."
2,"TEXT_AKTKCT301_04802_SEQ_02","Upon Mowen's arrival to the Exedra, Grenoldt elects to greet the object of his affections with a merry jig. To his surprise, Mowen answers his unexplained steps with a few of her own, and the two lose themselves in a moment of blissful dance. With his fond memories of the past rekindled, Grenoldt musters up the courage to ask for Mowen's hand in marriage─an offer she will happily accept once Grenoldt's travails with the splendorous tools have concluded. Grenoldt returns to the Crystalline Mean with newfound determination, while Chora-Zoi suggests you follow suit."
3,"TEXT_AKTKCT301_04802_SEQ_03","Overflowing with renewed vigor, Grenoldt resolves to bring his all to bear in hopes of producing a tool worthy of Mowen and the Boutique's increasingly lofty expectations. Together with Chora-Zoi, you pledge to aid him in these final endeavors, your sights set higher than the very stars you once returned to Norvrandt."
