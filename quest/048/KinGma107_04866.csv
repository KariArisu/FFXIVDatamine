53,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_KRILE_000_021","I can only assume they are still recovering from the damage wrought by the storm."
54,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_022","Indeed... Well, let's do what we came to do and find this elector."
55,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ZANUHALI_000_023","(-Elderly Hanu Woman-)Ohokaliy!"
56,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_024","Oho...what now?"
57,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ERENVILLE_000_025","It's a Hanu greeting. Surely you heard it the last time you were here."
58,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_026","Well, I was busy enjoying the festival..."
59,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ZANUHALI_000_027","Greetings to the Third Promise and her entourage! I, Zanuhali, welcome you to Ok'hanu."
60,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ZANUHALI_000_028","As elder of my people, I shall also be fulfilling the duties of elector during the rite of succession."
61,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_029","So our idea about the electors was correct. We just do as Papa said, and retrace his path from the saga!"
62,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_030","I'm ready! Give me the feat and test my worth!"
63,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ZANUHALI_000_031","All in good time, all in good time. In fact, I came to let you know that we are not quite ready to begin."
64,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ZANUHALI_000_032","For the moment, please enjoy the hospitality of our village."
65,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_033","Should we poke around a bit, then? We might pick up some clues about the feat. You know, prepare ourselves."
66,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ALISAIE_000_034","That's surprisingly prudent of you."
67,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_035","What! You think I'm being too cautious!?"
68,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ALISAIE_000_036","No, no, I'm impressed, is all. You admire and respect your father, who is prone to decisive action, so I expected you to rush in first and ask questions later. Or never."
69,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_037","I do look up to Papa, but you should know that he has a pragmatic side too. The Head of Reason is the thinker who takes time to consider all the possibilities."
70,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_038","With the long naps he takes these days, though, the Head of Resolve is less restrained by his wisdom. I can't fault you for thinking that's all there is to him, but there's more to the Dawnservant you've seen thus far."
71,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ALPHINAUD_000_039","I should like to speak with the Head of Reason one day."
72,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_040","Ah, well...I'm sure you'll catch him awake soon enough."
73,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ERENVILLE_000_041","To return to the subject at hand, you wish to take a look around Ok'hanu, then? Do some groundwork before the feat begins?"
74,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_042","Something like that. I mean, I could probably pass this test with my eyes closed, but it'll keep us busy while we're waiting!"
75,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ALPHINAUD_000_043","Wuk Lamat has the right of it. As Elder Zanuhali is a resident of this village, learning more about it can only improve our chances in the feat."
76,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_044","Right, then. It helped to do some investigating at Wachunpelo, so let's take a look around here as well!"
77,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ALPHINAUD_000_045","Might I suggest a division of forces? For instance, Erenville, Alisaie, and Krile could concentrate on the southern half of the settlement."
78,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ALPHINAUD_000_046","Meanwhile, Wuk Lamat, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and myself will handle this northern half."

83,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_HANUHANUNOTFEELING04866_000_057","With the supplies and help the Dawnservant sent, we're making progress repairing and rebuilding our homes..."
84,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_HANUHANUNOTFEELING04866_000_058","But while rooves and walls can be patched, there is so much else that was lost for good..."
85,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_HANUHANUNOTFEELING04866_000_059","<sigh>"
86,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_SYSTEM_000_060","The gaping hole in the wall and missing portion of the roof are clearly the work of the storm's powerful winds. Repairs appear to be ongoing."
87,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_HANUHANUNOTFEELING04866_000_070","<sigh> What are we to do...?"
88,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_075","A lot of houses are still damaged, and the Hanu I've spoken to are not their usual cheery selves. That storm broke more than wood and reeds."
89,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_076","There must be something I can do to help them..."
90,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_077","I'm going to look around a bit more."
91,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ALPHINAUD_000_080","Some manner of boat?"
92,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_SYSTEM_000_085","The dry and shrunken bundles suggest the reeds were harvested some time ago."
93,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_SYSTEM_000_086","Woven from reeds, this boat-like vessel is reminiscent of a bird. The beak and feathered tail in particular stand out."
94,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ALPHINAUD_000_090","This boat must be woven from the same reeds I've seen gathered into bundles here and there. The plants hold both practical and cultural significance to the Hanu, then..."
95,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_KRILE_000_091","(-Krile-)Hello, can you all hear me?"
96,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_KRILE_000_092","(-Krile-)I'm told they're ready to receive us now. Come to the large building in the south of the village!"
97,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_WUKLAMAT_000_093","(-Wuk Lamat-)On my way!"
98,"TEXT_KINGMA107_04866_ALPHINAUD_000_094","We ought to hurry over, too."
