1,"TEXT_KINGBA211_04825_SEQ_01","Though she attempts to put on a brave face, Loashkana reveals that there has been little word on the Heartsting's whereabouts. Just as she begins rethinking her plans, however, the sunny Yellowjacket storms into your conversation, eager to report that the pair masquerading as fruit merchants has left Limsa Lominsa for Aleport. Her spirits lifted, Loashkana makes for the hamlet and urges you to follow at your earliest convenience."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA211_04825_SEQ_02","Loashkana greets you in Aleport with potentially good news─a veteran merchant may have information to share regarding the pair you seek. With no other leads, you head off in search of the trader."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA211_04825_SEQ_03","The merchant is aware of the traveling pair, and claims he last spotted them selling potions and elixirs to two fledgling adventurers. Upon learning that the remedies may be poisoned, he bids you seek out the likely targets, who were last seen on their way to Swiftperch."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA211_04825_SEQ_04","You locate the adventurers─Wyssulm and Zerig─under attack by an aggressive trio of mammets. With the mechanical monstrosities thus dispatched, Wyssulm looks to you for a helping hand."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA211_04825_SEQ_05","Wyssulm thanks you for your timely aid, but wastes no time making his next request on Zerig's behalf. The conjurer suffers from an uncontrollable and violent bout of hiccups, and the lad requires Esuna to speak clearly once more."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA211_04825_SEQ_06","With Zerig's hiccups finally cured, the adventurers breathe a sigh of relief...yet the moment is short-lived. Ellerete and Kokonowa─the Unbound brigands─bombastically reveal themselves, though the two vanish in a cloud of putrid smoke as quickly as they appeared. Realizing that she must reevaluate her approach if she is to corner her quarry, Loashkana returns to Limsa Lominsa to gather her thoughts."
7,"TEXT_KINGBA211_04825_SEQ_07","Though the Unbound's misuse of the Heartsting stokes Loashkana's ire, she takes a small victory in having discovered the culprits' identities. She urges you to prepare yourself in the meantime, for the hunt shall soon continue...

※The next role quest will be available from Loashkana upon reaching level 94 in any healer class."
