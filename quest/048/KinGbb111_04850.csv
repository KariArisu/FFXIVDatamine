As her business ventures are threatened by the arrival of Iq Soq Xmajun, she has hired a team of experts to track the beast.

6,"TEXT_KINGBB111_04850_SEQ_06","After comparing notes with Keshkwa and the other hunters, the naturalist of the group confidently declares Iq Soq Xmajun's failure to cover its tracks indicative of a lack of intelligence. Keshkwa is quick to disagree, asserting that the vidraal is testing the hunters, but his words of warning fall on deaf ears. The hunters resolve to proceed with their proposed strategy, ordering you and your mentor to stay behind and await further instructions."

In attempting to draw out Iq Soq Xmajun, they incurred its wrath, and were slaughtered to a man. Golias soon arrives to deal with the aftermath, and requests that you report the incident to the hunters' employer, Innocent Stork."
9,"TEXT_KINGBB111_04850_SEQ_09","Innocent Stork is shocked to hear that her team of experts was so resoundingly defeated.
