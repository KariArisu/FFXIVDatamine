2,"TEXT_FESVLX002_04809_SEQ_02","Though the audacious pose understandably takes lovelorn Gridanians by surprise, it proves effective in inspiring them to act on their feelings. With your work done, it is time to return to Astrid at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
3,"TEXT_FESVLX002_04809_SEQ_03","Whilst you and Emilie are sharing your experiences with Astrid, a distraught Lisette stumbles before the stage, claiming to have seen Hortefense meeting with a secret lover. While somewhat doubtful of this assertion, Astrid urges Lisette to be brave and confront her betrothed so she might get to the truth of this matter. Finding courage in the symbol of the heart─a symbol originating from her ancestor, the Countess Arabelle─Lisette storms off to show Hortefense the error of his alleged ways. Worried for her sister, Astrid asks you and Emilie to follow Lisette to the Carline Canopy."
4,"TEXT_FESVLX002_04809_SEQ_04","You find Lisette struggling to express herself before Hortefense and a young woman. After you offer her a word of encouragement, Lisette at last demands an explanation from her beau. Before he can utter a word, however, the young woman reveals that she had merely sought Hortefense's advice in courtship. Surprised, yet relieved, Lisette performs the newfound gesture of ardor and affection for the maiden, telling her to follow her heart. With the misunderstanding resolved, Emilie suggests you both return to Astrid, who is undoubtedly eager to learn of how matters fared."
5,"TEXT_FESVLX002_04809_SEQ_05","Astrid thanks you for supporting her sister and expresses her joy that Emilie's tender expression has raised interest in the symbol of the festival─the heart. Full of hope that more and more folk will be inspired to learn of its history and the story of its creator, she wishes you the happiest of Valentione's Days, performing her own adorable rendition of the love heart."
