1,"TEXT_KINGBA511_04843_SEQ_01","Tepeke has learned that the Justiciar's dubious exploits have won the hearts of the youth. Although you know his skills to be somewhat overstated, you also know how quickly a good story can turn the hearts of the people. Tepeke does not intend to remain idle, and she suggests taking advantage of the Justiciar's newfound popularity to inquire as to his whereabouts. She wishes to start in Radz–at–Han, where stories of the supposed hero's deeds are doubtless the talk of the town."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA511_04843_SEQ_02","In order to track your quarry, Tepeke plans to visit the High Crucible to obtain a mixture that will help detect traces of aether left behind after magicks are used. In the meantime, you are tasked with quizzing the Radiant Host to see what they know about the Justiciar."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA511_04843_SEQ_03","The Radiant Host soldier reveals that his order is keeping a close watch on the Justiciar. Apparently, several Radiant have encountered the man during their patrols, with stories of him trouncing wild beasts with mysterious falling stones. Having learned what you can, you head back to Tepeke to share your findings."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA511_04843_SEQ_04","While somewhat disappointed that the Radiant had little in the way of new information, she is heartened that others are treating the situation with some gravity. She informs you that she has procured the powder she sought, and intends to use it at the Perfumed Rise, where the Justiciar was recently sighted."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA511_04843_SEQ_05","After Tepeke sprinkles the powder around a conspicuously placed rock, you focus your senses and detect lingering aether from previous exposure to magical energy. Tepeke concludes that the treasure can somehow manipulate stones, but further contemplation is interrupted by the appearance of a Radiant. He informs you that a young Auri girl ran away from home to join the Justiciar, and begs for your aid in finding her. You readily agree, and the soldier suggests searching areas where the Justiciar has not been sighted. With her encyclopedic knowledge of his comings and goings, Tepeke proposes traveling to the northern shores. Go there with haste and find the young girl before aught befalls her."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA511_04843_SEQ_06","You scour the beaches and eventually come across the young girl being accosted by a pair of snarling valras. They fall quickly before your magic, but the girl is yet shivering in fear. Offer her aid and let her know that her real savior has arrived."
7,"TEXT_KINGBA511_04843_SEQ_07","The girl calms down, and Tepeke soon joins you, scolding the girl for following the Justiciar and insisting he is not to be trusted. This seems to confuse the lass, as she yet believes he has Radz–at–Han's best interests at heart. Tepeke apologizes for snapping at her, though it seems the girl is not ready to accept that her hero is anything but. With the rescue achieved, Tepeke volunteers to escort her back to Yedlihmad, and asks to meet you there later."
8,"TEXT_KINGBA511_04843_SEQ_08","With a pensive expression on her face, Tepeke confesses that she was the one who revealed the treasure's secrets to the Justiciar. He came to her village disguised as a merchant, and Tepeke told him everything about the Perch of the Apex in an attempt to impress the visitor from far-off lands. Her guilt brought her to Radz–at–Han in search of the thief, and now she is confused to see him ostensibly working to protect its people. While his intentions are perplexing, she will continue to search for clues as to his whereabouts, and bids you visit her from time to time in case a new morsel of information is uncovered.

※The next role quest will be available from Tepeke upon reaching level 94 in any magical ranged DPS class."
