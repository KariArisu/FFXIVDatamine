1,"TEXT_KINGBA131_04821_SEQ_01","You and Firmalbert ponder how best to find Leophyne when you hear a familiar voice. It seems Loazenikwe traveled to Ishgard out of concern for Tentoawa's well-being. After you reveal his condition, she suggests gathering ingredients for a mixture which her people have used to rouse previous Shut Eyes from inescapable slumbers. She requires dandelions from the Churning Mists and saliva from morbols in the Dravanian hinterlands, and asks that you gather the former ingredient first."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA131_04821_SEQ_02","After searching the Four Arms for its most vibrant dandelions, you find two that should go well with Loazenikwe's mixture. Your next task is to travel to the Dravanian hinterlands and seek out a mature morbol near the Answering Quarter. Once you find your quarry, gather its saliva by any means necessary."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA131_04821_SEQ_03","The aged morbol's scent is almost overpowering, but you manage to focus long enough to strike it down. Now that you have the required ingredients, return them to Loazenikwe before they spoil."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA131_04821_SEQ_04","With the ingredients you deliver, Loazenikwe concocts a mixture that successfully awakens Tentoawa from his deep sleep. The pair shares a heartfelt reunion, and although Tentoawa regrets his failure, a few encouraging words from you and Loazenikwe lift his spirits. With his purpose reaffirmed, he seems eager to speak with you."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA131_04821_SEQ_05","Now fully awake, Tentoawa declares his desire to abandon the rigid roles that define him and Loazenikwe, and choose a path where they can live normal lives together. Before that becomes a reality, however, Leophyne must be stopped. Tentoawa admits that he feels much weaker, and you suggest that perhaps the artifact transfers the aether of its target to its wielder, rather than the wielder transferring their fatigue. This has dire implications should Leophyne chose to use the artifact without restraint, and so Tentoawa pledges to train himself back into fighting shape before she acts again. Until then, he encourages you to do the same.

※The next role quest will be available from Tentoawa upon reaching level 98 in any tank class."
