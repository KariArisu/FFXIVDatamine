150,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_HANDELOUP_000_321","I first must discuss matters with the others involved before we present a plan to the lord commander. Although time is of the essence, I ask that you wait a while until our course is settled."
151,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_HANDELOUP_000_325","I shall summon all involved in planning the delegation to the Congregation at once. Pray wait while we discuss matters and reach a final decision."
152,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_FIRMALBERT_000_330","I have heard of your suggestion to join with the Zundu in bringing Leophyne to justice. We were so focused on our tarnished honor that we were blind to the allies right in front of us..."
153,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_LOAZENIKWE_000_335","Tentoawa told me what you learned of Leophyne. To be honest, I do empathize somewhat with her desire to be free from the bonds of sleep...but that's where my sympathy ends."
154,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_LOAZENIKWE_000_340","It's exactly because we must sleep that every waking moment is precious. A life awake is meaningless if we can't spend it with those we care about."
155,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_TENTOAWA_000_403","I realize now that I agreed to defend a people I know next to nothing about. Tell me of these Zundu we'll soon be visiting."

159,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_TENTOAWA_000_405","Really!? Two groups of such people, so far apart? The world really is full of surprises..."
160,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_TENTOAWA_000_406","Even a single city is enough for a lifetime. Every day I hear something that gives me food for thought..."
161,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_TENTOAWA_000_407","Like the story of the Dragonsong War, for instance. Generations of animosity between dragon and man that somehow ended in a rekindled fellowship."
162,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_TENTOAWA_000_408","I imagined a whole world like that. A world where there'd be no need for protectors."
163,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_TENTOAWA_100_408","The Wide Eye watches not only the monsters in the wilderness, but our neighbors as well. We've barely even considered sending “delegations” outside our village's gates."
164,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_TENTOAWA_110_408","And the cold snap only made things worse. With everyone struggling just to survive, our every thought goes towards defending our scarce resources."
165,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_TENTOAWA_000_409","But if we only look outward with wariness, there's no hope for the future to change. No hope to build trust. If only there was a way to bridge the distance between us, and greet tomorrow hand in hand..."
166,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_TENTOAWA_000_410","...Heh. But maybe that's just a silly dream."
167,"TEXT_KINGBA141_04822_LOAZENIKWE_000_411","Maybe. Either way, it's a beautiful thought."
