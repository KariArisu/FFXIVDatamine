0,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_SEQ_00","Loashkana is carefully planning her next move."
1,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_SEQ_01","With a confident countenance, Loashkana is eager to share her most recent theory on Ellerete and Kokonowa's location. Having realized that the pair rarely returns to the scenes of their prior crimes, Loashkana wishes to take the hunt to eastern La Noscea next, and requests your company in scouting Costa del Sol."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_SEQ_02","Following brief pleasantries, you learn that Ellerete has already made herself known in Costa del Sol with a poisoned bottle of wine. Though Gegeruju has left no evidence of the vintage in question, Wheiskaet provides you with another promising lead: mammets have been wandering the vicinity of Raincatcher Gully, and Loashkana is keen to survey the area next."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_SEQ_03","Loashkana proposes the two of you split up and search Raincatcher Gully for any signs of recent activity. With a few key locations in mind, you begin your survey, remaining alert for any mechanical monstrosities along the way."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_SEQ_04","Your search proves Wheiskaet's rumors true, and several mammets manifest from the shadows. Though you easily transform Kokonowa's finest crafts into scrap metal, you discover a concerning collection of notes wedged within one of the mammets, depicting Vylbrand's waterways in great detail. With Ellerete's previous plot still fresh in your mind, you conclude that these notes may be connected to another potential scheme, and plan to share the evidence with Loashkana."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_SEQ_05","Nary a moment after you reconvene with Loashkana, you are ambushed by the very subjects of your discussion. Ellerete announces to the two of you that she will stop at nothing to play her final trick on all who call Vylbrand home, and vanishes with Kokonowa in a cloud of ill-smelling smoke. Loashkana is rightfully concerned by these developments, and seeks your council before proceeding further."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_SEQ_06","After recovering from the ambush, Loashkana─though disheartened at the thought of letting Ellerete and Kokonowa escape─admits that there is likely naught else to be found in the area, and suggests you report to Gegeruju and Wheiskaet at Costa del Sol."
7,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_SEQ_07","You promptly return to Costa del Sol to share your findings with Gegeruju and Wheiskaet. With their future cooperation secured, the two of you decide to return to Limsa Lominsa."
8,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_SEQ_08","Knowing that countless lives hang in the balance, Loashkana fears that Ellerete's endgame is nigh, and allowing the Unbound to walk freely is too great a risk. She bids you prepare for the potential battle to come, and will await word from Gegeruju's messengers in the meantime.

※The next role quest will be available from Loashkana upon reaching level 100 in any healer class."

49,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_LOASHKANA_000_002","This won't come as a surprise, but Ellerete and Kokonowa went back into hiding after the Bronze Lake incident. With all their grandstanding, I wasn't expecting them to lay low for so long, but I doubt they'll keep it that way."

67,"TEXT_KINGBA241_04828_WHEISKAET_000_024","Judging by the way Master Gegeruju was darting around at the time, I suspected he'd been in his cups. Drank the whole bloody bottle, too, so if you wished to investigate the wine itself, I'm afraid that won't be possible."
