1,"TEXT_KINGBA311_04831_SEQ_01","With no news of further incidents in Kugane, I'toca believes the Dreamweave Cocoon's thief has found new soil in which to sow discord. The closest settlements outside of the city are found in the Ruby Sea, and who better to inquire about the recent state of affairs in the area than the bakufu soldiers who stand guard over its waters?"
2,"TEXT_KINGBA311_04831_SEQ_02","According to Ikaruga, a Confederate vessel recently approached the Ruby Price without authorization, almost sparking a fatal conflict. While the vessel eventually withdrew, the situation is tense and the soldiers fear it will escalate should a similar incident occur again. I'toca is keen to hear the Confederacy's side of the story, and so you set your sights on Sakazuki."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA311_04831_SEQ_03","The Confederates are alarmed to hear Ikaruga's claims, and assert that it is actually the bakufu soldiers who have recently stepped beyond their boundaries. I'toca will undoubtedly wish to hear your findings."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA311_04831_SEQ_04","The Confederate veteran reports that Captain Rasho has been acting strangely of late, voicing intentions to besiege the Ruby Price. The sudden change in his behavior leads I'toca to believe the thief may have assumed his form. You hasten towards the Isle of Bekko in the hopes of arriving there before any blood is spilled."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA311_04831_SEQ_05","Knowing Rasho personally, you are quickly able to see through the thief's facade, prompting I'toca to once more use her remedy to expose him. After a heated exchange, he reveals his intent to use the Dreamweave Cocoon to unveil the truth of the world─that people are cruel at heart. As he flees, I'toca attempts to shoot him down but misses yet again. Nevertheless, the Confederates thank you for intervening, and swear to remain vigilant for any further unusual activity in the Ruby Sea. With the thief again out of reach, I'toca suggests you both return to Kugane to plan your next steps."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA311_04831_SEQ_06","I'toca is more incensed by the thief's motive than you initially realized. Though regretful that he was able to evade capture once again, she resolves to work with the Confederacy to find his next likely target─and simultaneously tune her bow to peak condition.

※The next role quest will be available from I'toca upon reaching level 94 in any melee DPS class."
