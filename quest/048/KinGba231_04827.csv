1,"TEXT_KINGBA231_04827_SEQ_01","Loashkana reveals that Wyssulm and Zerig have discovered the thieves you seek. Your allies have agreed to rendezvous in Aleport to share their findings."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA231_04827_SEQ_02","Wyssulm and Zerig arrive in Aleport later than expected. Though they spied Ellerete and Kokonowa preparing to cross Bronze Lake, they were set upon by a multitude of mammets, and barely escaped to tell the tale. The fledgling adventurers reluctantly leave the rest of the chase to you, but wish you well as you press on to upper La Noscea."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA231_04827_SEQ_03","Your arrival at Camp Bronze Lake is met with a cacophonous chorus of pained laughter. Ellerete and Kokonowa have contaminated the waters of the Warmwine Sanitorium with illusory toxins, leaving no few victims in their wake. Before they make good their escape, Ellerete─suffering from the effects of her own poison─proclaims she has bigger plans for all of Vylbrand...but you and Loashkana must focus first on the victims of her mischief."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA231_04827_SEQ_04","As you cast your healing magicks upon the unfortunate victims, the hysterical laughter finally fades from the area, and an air of calm returns to the Warmwine Sanitorium. With your task completed, Loashkana awaits by the springs for reports of your success."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA231_04827_SEQ_05","Loashkana reflects on the chaos you have quelled, and soon realizes that Kokonowa remained unaffected by the Heartsting's toxins prior to the Unbound pair's escape. You suspect this may be due to Kokonowa's Dunesfolk heritage, and Loashkana is intrigued to learn the Lalafellin clan's tradition of regularly ingesting small amounts of poison to build immunity. With her questions partially answered, Loashkana suggests the two of you return to Limsa Lominsa."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA231_04827_SEQ_06","You have aided the people of Camp Bronze Lake, yet Loashkana fears for Ellerete's next grand scheme, as well as the potential poisons the Unbound member might master in the interim. With time being of the essence, Loashkana plans to survey the island on her own, that she might find further hints of your foes' next destination.

※The next role quest will be available from Loashkana upon reaching level 98 in any healer class."
