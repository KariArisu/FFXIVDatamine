53,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_005","During the Final Days, you and the Leveilleur children assisted me in exchange for stories about their mother and father.

65,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_016","Ah, yes! Why don't we pay Margrat a visit first? Quite gregarious, that one. Always eager to share her opinions."

67,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_020","This is the place. Let's see if she's in."
68,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_RESEARCHER04815_000_030","Can I help you with something?"
69,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_031","Yes, in fact. My apologies for intruding upon your break, but is Margrat available for a chat?"
70,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_RESEARCHER04815_000_032","Oh, er... No, she, er... Left for Thesauros, I think."
71,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_RESEARCHER04815_000_033","She mentioned something about a request...or getting something off her chest, I couldn't say for sure..."
72,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_034","Thesauros is a collective that oversees the allocation of research materiel, so naturally they have a branch here in Sharlayan Hamlet."
73,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_035","From quills to guildship commissions, Thesauros is a one-stop provider of countless invaluable services. They are committed to ensuring our researchers have what they need to perform their work effectively and efficiently."
74,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_036","I am sure Margrat will be kind enough to expound upon their offerings in <Emphasis>exhausting</Emphasis> detail when we find her. It's the building just across the plaza."

76,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_050","Here we are. I assume we'll find Margrat with our receptionist."
77,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_051","...That I should have to <Emphasis>explain</Emphasis> is an affront to common sense, but our development of Labyrinthos's infrastructure has been <Emphasis>painstakingly</Emphasis> rational, as befits this intellectual community."
78,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_052","We have <Emphasis>never</Emphasis> shirked our duty to share the returns of our research, be they informational or monetary, and Aporia's ledgers can surely attest to the equitable distribution of such dividends."
79,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_053","Since this <Emphasis>rational</Emphasis> system is designed to create a self-sustaining cycle of funding for our research, it is only <Emphasis>logical</Emphasis> to conclude that nothing is rotten in the state of Sharlayan Hamlet."
80,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_054","But do you know what <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> rotten, Hodge? What is hastening our decay, body and soul?"
81,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_055","The godsdamned <Emphasis>chairs</Emphasis>, Hodge! The blank, soulless walls! The complete inability to requisition anything deemed “irrelevant” to our research despite the <Emphasis>abundant</Emphasis> benefits they may provide─the sustainment of the <Emphasis>sanity</Emphasis> and well-being of us researchers!"
82,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_056","Tell me, is the mighty Labyrinthos bereft of wealth or <Emphasis>compassion</Emphasis>? I'd like to know, Hodge!"
83,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_057","...When I said she was eager to share her opinions, I confess this was not what I had in mind. Margrat, would you kindly stop berating Hodge for doing his job?"
84,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_058","B-Berating? No, I'm...I am merely submitting a request for answers regarding systemic failures whilst offering my assessment of the situation. But now that you're here, sir, perhaps you can use your authority to remedy this latest injustice!"
85,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_059","Would that I could, Margrat. Sadly, our resources have their limits, but I assure you that our associates at Thesauros will continue to make every effort to ensure each request receives due consideration."
86,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_060","Furthermore, in light of the correspondence I just received from your collaborators, you have more pressing matters to attend to. They say, and I quote:"

89,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_063","What about the word “impossible” is so difficult to comprehend!? Do they think we're exaggerating!? Or is the air too thin at the mountaintops of <Emphasis>privilege</Emphasis> from which our superiors deign to issue commandments!?"
90,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_064","Why is it that when we dare to hope that perhaps this time, <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> time it will be different─it always ends in the same catastrophe of unlearned lessons!?"
91,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_065","Do it again, but <Emphasis>faster</Emphasis>! Sacrifice health, hygiene, and personal happiness as you feed the furnace, its hunger for your labor insatiable! O minion, render up your everything on the altar of glorious progress!"
92,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_066","Oh, I can't stand it anymore... Take my life, my liberty, just leave me my fluffy bed! I've only just remembered its gentle caress... <sob>"
93,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_067","But no! After ripping us from the bosom of what meager comforts our servitude affords, they now expect us to bruise our buttocks upon chairs harder than the heads of the whole Forum combined!"
94,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_068","Upon the slags that greedy gil-pinchers refuse to replace on the grounds they are not <Emphasis>essential</Emphasis> for our work, despite the cries of our lower backs for succor, mournful and ceaseless and distracting, stifling genius and innovation...!"
95,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_Q2_000_069","What will you say?"
96,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_A2_000_070","Er...can I help somehow?"
97,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_A2_000_071","I swear to you, here and now, that I will make you a new chair if you stop talking."
98,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_072","Wait a moment... I've seen you somewhere before..."
99,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_073","Aether tanks! That's right, aether tanks, I remember!"
100,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_074","...Truly, you wish to help? Because even if I am more indebted to you than you to me, I am prepared to impose upon your goodwill if it will yield us even an onze of respite."
101,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_075","Tell me, are you an artisan? An aspiring gleaner? Someone willing to do what it takes?"
102,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_076","...Wait, you'd <Emphasis>make</Emphasis> me a chair? So in other words, you're an artisan!?"
103,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_077","And a humorist too, I see. Your jest is most welcome in these trying times. I doubt I was half the help to you as you would be to me, but I am prepared to impose upon your goodwill if it will yield us even an onze of respite. May I?"
104,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_078","Oh, I knew it! You exude a kindness that other people in our immediate vicinity decidedly lack!"
105,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_079","I'll get straight to the point: our bums are sore and our backs are curled like finger shrimp. Anything to help alleviate our pains would be greatly appreciated. Cushions, massage instruments, herbal supplements, <Emphasis>anything</Emphasis>."
106,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_080","Oh, and should you fear that a surplus of generosity might go to waste, know there is no shortage of achy researchers in my laboratory, so all donations will be put to good use."
107,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_MARGRAT_000_081","Rest assured you <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> be compensated with more than our glowing gratitude, too! You adventuring types like those colorful scrips, don't you? Well, I have a veritable tonze of them left over from an old project, so they are yours should they bring you joy."
108,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_082","...While your gesture humbles us, I would hate to think Margrat is pressuring you with her, er, <Emphasis>overzealousness</Emphasis>. Are you sure this arrangement would not be an imposition?"
109,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_083","Well, it's your prerogative, and I am sure your efforts will be appreciated by all."
110,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_THEOPAULDIN_000_084","Hodge, coordinate with the distributors of Margrat's scrips so we may establish a provisional exchange in these offices for our new partner's convenience."
111,"TEXT_SUBCTS605_04815_HODGE_000_085","...Understood."
