1,"TEXT_KINGMA112_04871_SEQ_01","You learn from the approachable Pelu that the road to Urqopacha has been made almost impassable by the recent storm. He does, however, offer to share a solution for traversing the difficult terrain before bidding you follow."
2,"TEXT_KINGMA112_04871_SEQ_02","Your road leads to Urqopacha. To embark upon the journey, you and your companions make your way to the alpaca stables."
3,"TEXT_KINGMA112_04871_SEQ_03","Much to Wuk Lamat's dismay, the Pelu suggests your party make use of alpacas for the journey to Urqopacha. The ride is relatively uneventful, and upon arriving in the region you meet with Bol Noq', a weaver who has just come from Wachunpelo. The affable soul proceeds to share with you a cautionary tale about making business deals with the Pelupelu while under the influence of their locally brewed spirit. Afterwards, Wuk Lamat charges on ahead, impulsive as ever, and the rest of you trail after her into the village."
4,"TEXT_KINGMA112_04871_SEQ_04","Erenville finds Wuk Lamat on the verge of making an unnecessary purchase, which leads him to chide her for doing the exact opposite of what was just discussed. The Pelupelu, you learn, are a clan of avid merchants and adroit conversationalists, and bringing happiness through trade is a core tenet of their culture. While they won't seek to deceive customers or sell them faulty wares, Erenville cautions that only a clear refusal will convince the diminutive people that there is no sale to be made."

62,"TEXT_KINGMA112_04871_ERENVILLE_000_053","As I recall, to reach Urqopacha, we depart from the Arch of the Dawn, then take the road west at the first fork. Should we be wary of anything along the way?"
63,"TEXT_KINGMA112_04871_PELUPELUCOLLABORATOR4864_000_054","That is indeed the way to Urqopacha. After the damage wrought by the recent downpour, however, you'll be doing more stumbling than walking."
