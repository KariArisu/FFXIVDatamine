1,"TEXT_KINGMA111_04870_SEQ_01","With Bakool Ja Ja's clumsy attempt to steal the float thwarted, the festivities can proceed as planned. Wuk Evu suggests that you let the villagers know that Ihih'hana will be held after all. True to form, he also strongly urges you to remember the traditional greeting when approaching the Hanuhanu. With the chat mode in <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Say<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter any phrase containing the word “Ohokaliy” to greet the Ok'hanu villagers."
2,"TEXT_KINGMA111_04870_SEQ_02","The mere knowledge that Ihih'hana will take place seemingly infuses the dejected villagers with eager anticipation. You can now return to Wuk Evu and commence the long-awaited festival."
3,"TEXT_KINGMA111_04870_SEQ_03","Chosen by Linuhanu as the festival's guest of honor, Wuk Lamat boards the float and is carried in a growing procession towards the sacred site of Kozanuakiy. Once there, the true magic of Ihih'hana manifests, the concentrated aether of the festival-goers harnessed and dispersed throughout the land in a spectacular display. You and your companions rush to check the fields, where Wuk Lamat looks over the now-revitalized reeds with an expression of awe."
4,"TEXT_KINGMA111_04870_SEQ_04","Owing to the festivities, the better part of the fields have been restored. The remainder is soon tended to by Koana, who arrives with an alchemical concoction prepared with the aid of his “Archon allies”─an explanation which gives you and your comrades pause. Overjoyed with Wuk Lamat and Koana's successful efforts, Zanuhali awards them both with a keystone. The feat is complete, and your party now looks to return to Tuliyollal in preparation for the next challenge."
5,"TEXT_KINGMA111_04870_SEQ_05","Still giddy from the festival and her success with the reeds, Wuk Lamat thinks back on the wonderful people she's met on her journey. Excited for the encounters still to come, she ushers you along back to Tuliyollal and Xbalyav Ty'e."
6,"TEXT_KINGMA111_04870_SEQ_06","Wuk Lamat is inordinately pleased with her progress thus far. With luck, the next stage of the contest will continue just as smoothly..."
