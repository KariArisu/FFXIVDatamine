88,"TEXT_KINGMA105_04864_ERENVILLE_000_042","I heard a lot of talk as we toured the city about that storm we passed through at sea. Apparently it ravaged Yok Tural several days ago."
89,"TEXT_KINGMA105_04864_ERENVILLE_000_043","Since our roads are not as well paved as Eorzea's, they're more susceptible to damage from natural disasters. If we want to avoid wasting time taking a dead-end trail, I suggest we spend a few moments making inquiries."
