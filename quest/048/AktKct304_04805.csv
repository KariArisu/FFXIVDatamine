※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_AKTKCT304_04805_SEQ_01","After a moment of celebration for your splendorous tool's completion, Chora-Zoi is quick to remark on Grenoldt and Mowen's prospective wedding. Though the legendary smith initially doubts he can be a worthy spouse, Mowen reassures her betrothed, and the two are wed on the shores of the Source. Knowing their travails may keep them far apart, the couple vows their fidelity to one another with a pair of miniature kettles. Once the ceremony is concluded, you sense Grenoldt wishes one more word with you, that he might voice his appreciation for your unwavering efforts as collaborator and confidant.

※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_AKTKCT304_04805_SEQ_02","The road has been long and winding and replete with trade goods, but your efforts have borne fruit in many ways, both expected and unexpected: Grenoldt and Mowen, awash in marital bliss, reaffirm their continued efforts to reshape Norvrandt's trades for the better. Chora-Zoi, meanwhile, has gained the confidence to thrive as a smith, and bids you return to the Mean whenever the urge to forge a new splendorous tool takes you. As you reflect upon your long journey, you recall Chora-Zoi mentioning her involvement with the Mean's leaders during the project, and wonder what new insights each Facet might have to offer."
