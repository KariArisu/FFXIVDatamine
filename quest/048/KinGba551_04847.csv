1,"TEXT_KINGBA551_04847_SEQ_01","The stage has been set for your final battle with Virazahn, for Tepeke informs you that the Radiant Host has arranged an arena in the mountain pass toward Khadga that is suitably epic in atmosphere. Word has been spread that you shall await him there, and Tepeke is confident that he will be unable to leave the challenge unanswered. She asks you to meet her at the Giantsgall Grounds, where the entrance to the pass is located."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA551_04847_SEQ_02","As Tepeke foresaw, you do not wait long until Virazahn appears. After a characteristically pompous speech, he draws his weapon and combat ensues. While the Perch of the Apex rains down massive stones from the sky, you and Tepeke manage to navigate the barrage and pummel Virazahn into submission. With your enemy beaten, the time is come to return to the Giantsgall Grounds."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA551_04847_SEQ_03","Sensing defeat closing in, Virazahn attempts to run, only to be knocked senseless by a rock falling from the sky. The Radiant Host soon arrives to take Virazahn away, and Tepeke reclaims her village's stolen treasure. She looks eager to share in this triumphant moment."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA551_04847_SEQ_04","With her mission complete, Tepeke expresses her desire to return home and bring the Perch of the Apex to its rightful place. Before she does, however, she must thank all those who helped her. She asks you to meet her at Tuliyollal, where her parents await, for a final farewell."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA551_04847_SEQ_05","You arrive at Xbalyav Ty'e before Tepeke does, and in the meantime relate all that happened to her proud parents. She joins the conversation soon after and makes a surprising suggestion that her people should learn how to use the perch safely instead of locking it away to be shrouded in legend again. While the feasibility of the prospect is still in question, Tepeke and Nettse are optimistic that the villagers will listen to the words of the one who succeeded in retrieving the treasure. Tepeke and her family say their farewells, and you hope that one day your paths may cross again."
