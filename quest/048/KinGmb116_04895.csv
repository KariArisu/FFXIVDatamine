49,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_KOANA_000_005","The matter of outdoing our father aside, this was the best outcome we could have hoped for. Never again will our people need fear the looming shadow of the Skyruin."

51,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_ALISAIE_000_015","Witnessing Zoraal Ja in battle, I understand why he's widely considered to be Tuliyollal's greatest warrior."
52,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_URIANGER_000_020","'Tis fortunate we vanquished that winged calamity ere it could inflict greater suffering upon these lands."
53,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_ERENVILLE_000_025","Spending time alone with Sareel Ja was akin to torture. Despite my obvious disinterest, he spewed a constant stream of mean-spirited bile. Honestly, I might have preferred facing fire and ruin with you on the battlefield..."

55,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_THANCRED_000_031","I suggest we hurry back and allay their fears. Alphinaud's as well, I should think."
56,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_WUKLAMAT_000_032","Yes, you're right! We shouldn't let them worry another moment!"
57,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_ERENVILLE_000_040","I expected I would be asked to track many things during the course of our journey, but Valigarmanda was not among them."

61,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_ALISAIE_000_060","Scaling a massive mountain. Fighting an elector. Battle against a legendary monstrosity... Yes, you could say I'm a little tired."

67,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_ALPHINAUD_000_090","With only two keystones remaining, we've at last begun to gain a fuller picture of the legend of the golden city."

70,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_GURFURLUR_000_097","Watching Vorporlor get caught up in Wuk Lamat's unstoppable wake reminds me of my younger days..."
71,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_WUKLAMAT_000_100","I don't think Vorporlor and his brethren will have a sudden change of heart about Tuliyollal."
72,"TEXT_KINGMB116_04895_WUKLAMAT_000_101","But that doesn't mean they'll never change at all. Today is proof of that!"
