1,"TEXT_KINGBA221_04826_SEQ_01","Despite a lack of new leads on the Heartsting, Loashkana's usual vigor returns to her as she formulates another plan of attack. She suggests the Unbound may be taking advantage of her unfamiliarity with Vylbrand, and thus she sets her sights on a new location: the Moraby Drydocks."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA221_04826_SEQ_02","A young shipwright stands anxiously at Loashkana's side, requesting your assistance in finding his lost brother. Though the task is a considerable detour in your plans, Loashkana is eager to tackle it all the same, and volunteers to find the shipwright's brother─a young boy sporting bright red hair."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA221_04826_SEQ_03","You find a tearful lad matching the shipwright's description. Loashkana is quick to comfort the young boy, and assures him that the two of you will return him to his older brother."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA221_04826_SEQ_04","The shipwright is overjoyed to see his brother safe and sound. Loashkana inquires as to whether he has heard aught of Ellerete or Kokonowa's misdeeds, but the man is unfamiliar with any such incidents. Ever the optimist, Loashkana is contented to know that the two criminals are nowhere to be found in the area, and makes the most of this reprieve to invite you to the docks for a friendly chat."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA221_04826_SEQ_05","Loashkana regales you with tales of her home in Xak Tural─a small village of hunters who thrive amongst venomous flora and fauna. She emphasizes the importance of the Heartsting to her people, and reaffirms her commitment to bringing it home. There is yet work to be done if she wishes to track down Ellerete and Kokonowa, however, and she bids you return to Limsa Lominsa for the time being, that you might discuss your next steps."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA221_04826_SEQ_06","Not long after your return to the maritime city-state, you are greeted by Wyssulm and Zerig, who happily pledge to aid Loashkana's cause. Delighted at the prospect of newfound allies, Loashkana promises to keep you abreast of the latest information as it comes to light.

※The next role quest will be available from Loashkana upon reaching level 96 in any healer class."
