Though he was quickly exposed, the insidious individual's present whereabouts are unknown. If he remains in Doma, the most likely place for him to infiltrate next would be Yanxia─your next destination."

He claims to have given you directions to the House of the Fierce just moments earlier, making it clear that the thief has taken on your form. You and I'toca rush for the hidden refuge to catch your quarry before his plot unfolds."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA321_04832_SEQ_04","Much as you feared, the thief has assumed your form in an attempt to incite war between Doma and the Azim Steppe. Thankfully, with one toss of the remedy, his ruse is dispelled. As the impersonator attempts to flee, I'toca shoots an arrow but misses once again. Seeing this third futile attempt, you ask her if she is truly the hunter she claims to be. The question draws the thief's attention, who reveals that the real I'toca is already dead by his hand, and the person beside you is herself an impostor. He then makes good his escape, and after you explain the situation to the Doman ninja, one of them reveals that the insidious individual was once of their order before he was conscripted by the Garlean army as a spy. His name: Samidare. This day of revelations is not yet over, as “I'toca” promises to explain herself upon returning to Kugane."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA321_04832_SEQ_05","“I'toca” finally confesses that her real name is Kuiyki, and that it was indeed her fault the Dreamweave Cocoon was stolen from her village. To right her mistake, she made the voyage to Kugane, where she encountered I'toca, and together they attempted to retrieve the stolen relic. Yet tragedy fell when Samidare murdered the elite huntress, leaving Kuiyki to carry out this mission alone─until she met you. With your help, she believes she can avenge I'toca and recover the cocoon at the same time. Remorseful for her deception, Kuiyki hopes you will lend her your aid once more when a new lead comes to light.

※The next role quest will be available from Kuiyki upon reaching level 96 in any melee DPS class."
