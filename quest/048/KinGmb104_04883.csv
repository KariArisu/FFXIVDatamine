1,"TEXT_KINGMB104_04883_SEQ_01","Wuk Lamat departs for Vollok Shoonsa, leaving you to your own devices. The suggestion to return to the For'ard Cabins and take a well-deserved rest, however, does sound very tempting..."
2,"TEXT_KINGMB104_04883_SEQ_02","You head back to the cabins only to find a Landsguard soldier awaiting your arrival. It seems the Dawnservant has summoned you to the palace, and you are to present yourself to the gate guard stationed outside Sunperch."
3,"TEXT_KINGMB104_04883_SEQ_03","Heeding the soldier's advice, you proceed to your appointment dressed for battle. Yet for what reason might such preparations be warranted?"
4,"TEXT_KINGMB104_04883_SEQ_04","Upon entering Sunperch, Gulool Ja Ja soon makes it clear that his summons was an invitation to duel. You spar against the massive Mamool Ja, his powerful and viper-fast blows keeping you on your toes, until he is at last satisfied with your performance. Impressed by your battlecraft, the Dawnservant follows the bout with a father's earnest request to watch over his daughter. It is then that Wuk Lamat arrives. She chides Gulool Ja Ja for stealing away her champion, and exits the throne room with you in tow."
5,"TEXT_KINGMB104_04883_SEQ_05","Annoyed by her father's antics, Wuk Lamat wonders if Gulool Ja Ja has been bothering you with things other than duels─a query you deflect with a noncommittal answer. The Dawnservant's plea remains at the forefront of your mind, however, as you accompany the Third Promise on the continuation of her journey."
