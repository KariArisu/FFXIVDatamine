With little time to waste, the two of you hasten to Raincatcher Gully."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA251_04829_SEQ_02","A panicked Brayflox claims that Ellerete and Kokonowa mean to target Mudstop Watergush─one of the main sources of freshwater on Vylbrand─and Loashkana is keen to give chase as soon as possible. Once your preparations are complete, she bids you speak with her to commence the battle for the Longstop."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA251_04829_SEQ_03","In the depths of the Longstop do you find Ellerete and Kokonowa preparing to enact their wicked plan. Before the miscreants succeed, you must make haste and reclaim the Heartsting with Loashkana."

5,"TEXT_KINGBA251_04829_SEQ_05","Brayflox's home is freed from its Unbound influence, and the goblin joyfully conveys her gratitude to you and Loashkana.

6,"TEXT_KINGBA251_04829_SEQ_06","As Wyssulm and Zerig reflect on their adventure with Loashkana, the two resolve to grow stronger, that they might one day cross the western seas and reunite in Tural.

7,"TEXT_KINGBA251_04829_SEQ_07","Loashkana has much on her mind as she contemplates her time in Eorzea. She has witnessed new possibilities for the Heartsting─both helpful and harmful─and informs Nyipine that their people must explore new avenues of poison resistance should the heirloom ever fall into the wrong hands again. Before that discussion can truly begin, however, the journey home must take precedence, and with a final good-bye, Loashkana expresses her gratitude for the peace you have returned to her people."
