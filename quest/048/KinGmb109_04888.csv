51,"TEXT_KINGMB109_04888_KOANA_000_003","I had but to invoke his name. Thancred followed the Hoobigo's boat to its destination, and confirmed that they are indeed holding my sister captive."

58,"TEXT_KINGMB109_04888_WUKLAMAT_000_014","I shouldn't have been so careless. I underestimated him, and it cost me a keystone!"
59,"TEXT_KINGMB109_04888_WUKLAMAT_000_015","Fonjeantaine upended his life so that I could accomplish the Moblin's feat. He believed in me─believed in my cause─and I've let him down!"

69,"TEXT_KINGMB109_04888_KOANA_000_022","A reference to Sareel Ja, I would assume. He is devoted to our brother, and is the only Boonewa I know of participating in the rite of succession."

79,"TEXT_KINGMB109_04888_KRILE_000_040","Koana is the picture of composure and rationality...except when it comes to matters concerning Wuk Lamat's safety. Far be it from me to fault a brother for being protective, but still."

83,"TEXT_KINGMB109_04888_ALISAIE_000_044","Though they share a single body, it's obvious Bakool Ja Ja has two minds when you see one head calming the other head down."
84,"TEXT_KINGMB109_04888_ALISAIE_000_045","His personalities are as distinct as two individuals could be."
85,"TEXT_KINGMB109_04888_WUKLAMAT_000_046","I really am sorry this happened. From now on, I won't let my guard down around suspicious strangers."
