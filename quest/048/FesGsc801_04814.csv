A horde of water imps has allegedly appeared in the Saucer's gilded halls, and the journalist is keen to learn the creatures' motives for his newest article. Hoping to gather more information on the scene, Quevain requests your assistance in the matter, and bids you join him at Entrance Square.

As thanks for promoting the Saucer's festivities, Godbert ensures that you do not leave empty-handed, and presents you with your very own impish attire, that you might enjoy the remainder of this golden celebration in costume...if you so choose."
