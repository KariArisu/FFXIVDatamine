102,"TEXT_KINGMC103_04899_WUKEVU_000_092","In its most basic sense, the conflict between the Xbr'aal and Mamool Ja was one of land."
103,"TEXT_KINGMC103_04899_WUKEVU_000_093","The Mamool Ja live in the lower forest, where the thick canopy obscures the sun and the soil is unforgiving to crops. This drove them to covet the upper forest─the home of the Xbr'aal─and they launched a determined campaign to seize it for themselves."
104,"TEXT_KINGMC103_04899_WUKEVU_000_094","Yet advantage ever favors higher ground, and the Xbr'aal forces held the upper hand against the invaders, rebuffing them time and again."

107,"TEXT_KINGMC103_04899_WUKEVU_000_097","You must understand. The Mamool Ja were once a people as much at war with themselves as they were with others."
108,"TEXT_KINGMC103_04899_WUKEVU_000_098","The Hoobigo, Boonewa, and Doppro each sought to assert dominance over the others, even as they engaged the Xbr'aal in battle."

114,"TEXT_KINGMC103_04899_WUKEVU_000_104","Under the Autarch's rule, the newly united Mamool Ja became a force to be feared, and the war soon came to a head."
