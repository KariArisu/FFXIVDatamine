66,"TEXT_KINGMB101_04880_KRILE_000_065","Goodness me! It's like the entire village is made of pottery!"
67,"TEXT_KINGMB101_04880_ALPHINAUD_000_070","Even as Hanuhanu culture is distinct from the Vanu, Moblin society has developed quite differently to that of their goblin cousins."

71,"TEXT_KINGMB101_04880_ALISAIE_000_082","The settlements themselves couldn't be more different, though. This shire appears custom-built to resemble pots, while the other is a repurposed town."

77,"TEXT_KINGMB101_04880_REDIROQ_000_088","The storm which hit our village shattered the cliffs and dropped rocks on our braincases! Many helphands for the potsworn were injured. This is no time for feats or mettletests!"
78,"TEXT_KINGMB101_04880_WUKLAMAT_000_089","I'm sorry to hear that. After learning what the storm did to the stairs, I feared you'd been caught in its path. Uh, not to change the subject, but...what are the “potsworn”?"
79,"TEXT_KINGMB101_04880_ERENVILLE_000_090","Goldsmiths contracted to work for the Moblins. The word comes from the pot-like workshops where they practice their craft."
80,"TEXT_KINGMB101_04880_ERENVILLE_000_091","The Moblins provide these potsworn with tools, materials, living quarters─everything the artisans could possibly need. This allows them to concentrate on producing what is widely known as the finest gold- and metalwork in Tural."

85,"TEXT_KINGMB101_04880_WUKLAMAT_000_096","Then let us stand in for the injured helpers! It would give me the chance to learn more about your people and your village, and if it brings us closer to beginning the feat, then all the better!"
86,"TEXT_KINGMB101_04880_WUKLAMAT_000_097","This isn't strictly part of the contest, so don't feel obligated to join in. Take a rest while you can."
