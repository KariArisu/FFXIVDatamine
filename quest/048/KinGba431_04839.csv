1,"TEXT_KINGBA431_04839_SEQ_01","Armed with fresh insight into the gang of bandits, you now know that Chalteaufite controls most of his lackeys through intimidation. With this in mind, Ceetol Ja suggests making contact with the two henchmen masquerading as merchants to see if some common ground can be found."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA431_04839_SEQ_02","Upon arriving in Ala Gannha, you waste no time in locating your targets. Avenel and Pepin, the pair masquerading as merchants, soon reveal the true nature of their relationship with Chalteaufite. He won over several poor citizens of Ul'dah by demonstrating the power of the Steelhog Vessel and making promises of change. After it became clear that his aims amounted to little more than raiding merchant caravans, the other members quickly became disillusioned, though their attempts at protest were met with threats and violence from their mystically empowered leader. Pepin also confirms that the mercenary Kaqool Ja is indeed a stranger to these lands, having crossed an ocean to reach Eorzea. Contrite for their past deeds, the two merchants offer to help convince others to leave the gang and retrieve the artifact, a proposal which Ceetol Ja readily accepts."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA431_04839_SEQ_03","Ceetol Ja intends to reach out to Kaqool Ja, a fellow traveler from a similar region of Tural. As a show of goodwill, she plans to present to him a gift; a traditional incense burner complete with incense of the same aroma commonly used by her people, which will hopefully remind Kaqool Ja of his homeland and thereby make him more receptive to conversation. In order to create this incense, you will need to collect some copal tree resin, which as luck would have it, can be found nearby."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA431_04839_SEQ_04","The copal itself was not difficult to locate, but its powerful aroma has the unfortunate side effect of attracting deadly predators. You grant your voracious foe a swift demise, and now must make your way to Ceetol Ja to deliver the ingredient."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA431_04839_SEQ_05","Ceetol Ja is grateful indeed for the generous dollop of copal, and sets about mixing the incense. As the process will take some time, she sends you ahead in search of the intended recipient of the incense burner, Kaqool Ja, who was last sighted near the river running through Rustrock."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA431_04839_SEQ_06","You succeed in tracking down Kaqool Ja, and Ceetol Ja arrives a few moments later. She presents the incense burner, which even without being lit evokes memories of their shared homeland. The mercenary reveals that his primary reason for assisting Chalteaufite is to earn enough money for the ferry crossing back to Tural, which his employer has told him costs an exorbitant amount. When Ceetol Ja informs him that this is far from true, he comes to the realization that he has been deceived into aiding a heartless criminal, and resolves to confront Chalteaufite alone. With one more of Chalteaufite's gang turned, Ceetol Ja bids you return to the safety of Ala Ghiri."
7,"TEXT_KINGBA431_04839_SEQ_07","Although you and Ceetol Ja were unable to recruit Kaqool Ja as an ally to your cause, his defection from the gang and animosity towards Chalteaufite will undoubtedly tip the scales in your favor. Even so, you still have much to do before the bandits can be brought to justice.

※The next role quest will be available from Ceetol Ja upon reaching level 98 in any physical ranged DPS class."
