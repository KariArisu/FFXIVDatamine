1,"TEXT_KINGBA501_04842_SEQ_01","Tsuuhe seeks a mage to help recover an ancient treasure stolen from her village by a member of the Passage of the Unbound. Its powers are long forgotten, and Tsuuhe believes a magically inclined mind may prove useful in its recovery. She asks that you seek out her daughter, Tepeke, in Radz–at–Han, where her search for the thief has already begun. Although the city is large, you know that information flows freely through Balshahn Bazaar, so you decide to look for Tepeke there. Be on the lookout for a young Turali woman wielding a distinct sword and shield."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA501_04842_SEQ_02","You find Tepeke in the bazaar, and she welcomes the aid of a learned mage. She tells you the essence of a tural vidraal is sealed within the treasure, and that legend states its bearer will receive great fortune, but leave only sorrow in their wake. Tepeke then shares the story of a strange newcomer to Radz–at–Han who calls himself the Justiciar and claims to be the city's savior. Lacking any better leads, she suggests searching for this mysterious figure. Your starting point will be Yedlihmad, a small settlement where the Justiciar sometimes appears to rouse the public."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA501_04842_SEQ_03","At Yedlihmad you encounter a young boy who says the Justiciar but recently made an impassioned speech about nearby monsters before marching off into the wilderness to combat the threat. He was followed by one of the Radiant Host, who hopes to confirm the truth of the Justiciar's claims. The boy informs you that they headed towards the Shroud of the Samgha, which can be overlooked from the high vantage of Kadjaya's Footsteps."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA501_04842_SEQ_04","Gazing down from the cliffs, you spot an unconscious Radiant. You rush to his aid, and when he regains his senses, he relates to you the story of his encounter with the Justiciar. Clad head to toe in shining armor, the flamboyant man's idea of heroics is apparently to clear Radz–at–Han of one fiendish fungus at a time. He did this by brandishing a wooden object and calling out to some unseen power, after which rocks came tumbling from the sky, knocking the Radiant unconscious and slaying the menacing mushroom. Tepeke seems certain that the wooden object is the stolen artifact, but with the Justiciar nowhere to be seen, she decides that you should both escort the Radiant back to Yedlihmad."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA501_04842_SEQ_05","Soon after you return to Yedlihmad, the child from earlier approaches you to say that the Justiciar appeared in your absence, boasting of his triumph over a mighty beast. While the man's motivations and identity remain a mystery, Tepeke is resolute in her mission to retrieve the Perch of the Apex and restore the reputation of her father, the treasure's chosen guardian. She will continue to seek out information on the Justiciar's activities, and hopes that with two people working on the case, the Justiciar's mysteries will soon be unraveled.

※The next role quest will be available from Tepeke upon reaching level 92 in any magical ranged DPS class."
