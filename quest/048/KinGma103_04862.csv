67,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_038","I'm still struggling to conceive how one could construct an entire city on the side of a mountain."
68,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_039","This was originally the site of a Yok Huy temple. The giants built it when they were first making the bridge to Xak Tural, to appease the god who slumbers in the great ocean trench."
69,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_040","After the Yok Huy withdrew, the temple stood empty for centuries. So when Papa was establishing his new nation, he saw a structure he could refurbish into a palace, sitting practically in the center of Tural."
70,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_041","He gathered artisans to do the work, and the houses they built for themselves became the foundation of the city you see today!"
71,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_042","Speaking of houses, we'll be passing through the Resplendent Quarter, the biggest residential district in Tuliyollal. We climb these sets of stairs here─all the way up!"
72,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_SYSTEM_000_043","Your companions have yet to arrive. Be sure they are at your side before attempting to continue."
73,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_045","The stairs leading up to the peak can get pretty steep. Careful you don't fall─I've been one step away from death more than a few times!"
74,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_046","So this was once a place of worship... The Yok Huy seem a fascinating people, but I've not seen any in the city. I wonder when we'll have the chance to meet them."

77,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_052","You probably want to take a closer look, but we'll be coming back here later. Let's move on for now."
78,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_053","The sheer scale of this place is incredible. I wonder what that carving at the top represents..."
79,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_054","So, this is the Resplendent Quarter. What manner of people live here?"
80,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_055","Oh, we have residents from all the Yok Tural clans: Mamool Ja, Xbr'aal, Pelupelu, Moblin, Hanuhanu..."
81,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_056","We also have Tonawawta, Hhetsarro, and Shetona who moved south from their ancestral lands in Xak Tural."
82,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_057","In essence, it's a gathering of people from every corner of Tural."
83,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_058","A true representation of Tuliyollal's diverse character... The adornments on each building contribute to the eclectic cultural aesthetic. It's all so beautiful!"
84,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_059","I'm glad you think so! Come, we continue down the stairs."
85,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_060","You might hear the Hyur in Tural referred to as “Tonawawta,” one of our major clans. As for Erenville, he belongs to a Viera clan known as the “Shetona.”"
86,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_061","One need only look to the children playing for a sense of how peaceful things must be here."

88,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_071","That big drum there is called the Dawnherald. They play it for formal occasions, like when honoring the Landsguard's return from a dangerous duty."
89,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_072","I tried hitting it with my axe once and ripped the skin. Earned me a proper scolding, let me tell you! I think that was the time Papa held me upside down by the ankle..."
90,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_073","I've never seen such an enormous drum. What would one even use to beat such an instrument?"
91,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_074","And here are our dirigibles! Not bad, eh?"
92,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_075","I hear other nations use airships to sail the skies, but you'll only find balloons in Tuliyollal."
93,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_076","We have them for the exact same reason as the aetherytes. Koana brought back the plans from Sharlayan, and Papa thought them fantastic and commissioned their construction. This was around three years ago."
94,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_077","Since that time, we've added flights to other settlements. Trade with frontier communities has never been easier."
95,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_078","But that's enough about dirigibles. The Arch of the Dawn awaits!"
96,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_079","Balloons are all well and good, but flying through the air is not for me. It's not that I'm afraid, of course, it just seems...unnatural."
97,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_100_079","Hearing about dirigibles reminds me of the Ixal and their flying vessels. But whereas their designs use several bladders, it seems the Turali craft rely on one large envelope to lift them into the air."
98,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_080","This is it: the Arch of the Dawn."
99,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_081","When the giants were still here, it was known as the Yok Tural landgate. But when Papa founded Tuliyollal, everyone began using its present name in honor of his great achievement."
100,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_082","Through this gate is Kozama'uka, the wetlands south of the city. Depending on what the rite of succession asks of us, we might end up going in that direction."
101,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_083","Kozama'uka... The name alone is intriguing."
102,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_100_083","Speaking of which, what were those fluffy animals we passed earlier?"
103,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_084","Ah... Those are alpacas. Fearsome, four-legged fiends."
104,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_085","Fearsome? They seemed quite placid to me..."
105,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_100_086","You'll learn soon enough, Krile. You'll learn soon enough..."
106,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_WUKLAMAT_000_086","But forget the alpacas─I have something far more important to show you. Come along!"
107,"TEXT_KINGMA103_04862_KRILE_000_090","Are these pillars what Wuk Lamat wanted to show us?"
