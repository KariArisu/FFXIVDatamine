60,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ERENVILLE_000_012","The former depicts the cessation of hostilities between the Mamool Ja and Xbr'aal in the forests of Yak T'el. Specifically near a village called Iq Br'aax."
61,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_WUKLAMAT_000_013","That's where I was born, if you recall. I haven't been back there since Papa took me in when I was a baby."
62,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ERENVILLE_000_014","Where the Lay of the Brotherhood takes place, however, is unclear. In the saga, it is said that a foreign explorer came seeking an audience with the Dawnservant...but little more than that."
63,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ALPHINAUD_000_015","Eorzea has a similar tale─the explorer Ketenramm befriended a two-headed king known as the Autarch before commencing his travels across Tural."

70,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ERENVILLE_000_022","One of the grandest in Tural, once upon a time─and the seat of the Mamool Ja's homeland. It too lies in Yak T'el, not far from Iq Br'aax."
71,"TEXT_KINGMC101_04897_ALISAIE_100_022","Then all things considered, Yak T'el seems the obvious choice for our next destination."
