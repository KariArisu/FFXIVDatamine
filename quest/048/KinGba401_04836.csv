1,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_SEQ_01","The Steelhog Vessel has been stolen, and as two of the few remaining recipients of its protective blessing, Raholl Ja and his granddaughter Ceetol Ja are tasked with its retrieval. Their pursuit of the thief has led them to Tuliyollal, where he is believed to have boarded a ship and escaped to Eorzea. Fearing that the elderly Raholl Ja would not survive such a perilous voyage, Ceetol Ja has given chase alone, her only clue being an empty bottle of Ala Mhigan make left by the culprit. Raholl Ja asks that you search for his granddaughter, that you may lend her your knowledge and expertise. As her current location is unknown, you head to Rhalgr's Reach to gather information."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_SEQ_02","Upon arriving at Rhalgr's Reach, you quiz several Resistance members as to Ceetol Ja's whereabouts. The tall, slender thief she seeks apparently bears a passing resemblance to a bandit leader known to ply his trade in Virdjala. In all likelihood, your would-be ally has journeyed into the desert alone, heedless of the potential danger."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_SEQ_03","You succeed in locating Ceetol Ja, who is in the midst of aiding a stricken merchant. Though he has only minor injuries, his wares were stolen, and his escort left in pursuit of the criminals. You follow the escort and witness the bandit leader using the power of the Steelhog Vessel to render himself invulnerable, with the bodyguard's attacks leaving not so much as a scratch before he is sent sprawling by a magical blast. Somewhat uncharacteristically for a supposed master thief, the bearer of the artifact makes no bones about revealing his name─Chalteaufite─before he and his accomplices make their escape, uncontested. Ceetol Ja decides to escort the merchant and his escort to Rhalgr's Reach for medical attention, and asks you to meet her there to help report the incident to the Resistance."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_SEQ_04","After regrouping, you explain to Ceetol Ja that you were sent to Ala Mhigo at the behest of her grandfather, and you have agreed to assist her in reclaiming the Steelhog Vessel. With the artifact being used to further Chalteaufite's criminal activities, you and Ceetol Ja must act swiftly if you are to thwart whatever schemes he may be concocting.

※The next role quest will be available from Ceetol Ja upon reaching level 92 in any physical ranged DPS class."

52,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_RAHOLLJA_000_003","These steelhogs─as we call them─rely on their tough hides to protect themselves from predators. The legends speak of one that lived to an extraordinary age, perhaps due to its natural suit of armor, and came to be known as the Lord of the Forest."
53,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_RAHOLLJA_000_004","At the end of its long life, our ancestors enshrined the vidraal's soul within the Steelhog Vessel. For generations since, the divine blessings it bestows have been a great boon to my people."

56,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_RAHOLLJA_000_007","He came bearing exotic wares from foreign lands, and served alcohol freely, toasting often to new friendships. My people became caught up in celebration...and in the morning, the merchant was gone, along with the Steelhog Vessel."

59,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_RAHOLLJA_000_010","The journey here has already pushed this decrepit body of mine beyond its natural limits, and a lengthy voyage by sea would likely be my end. Although I urged Ceetol Ja not to make the crossing alone, she was determined to give chase."

65,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_RAHOLLJA_100_011","You see, as the thief took all of his wares with him, the only clue left behind was an empty bottle of whatever grog he was serving. After asking the sailors here, it seems it was produced in Ala Mhigo, and with no other leads, Ceetol Ja set forth."
66,"TEXT_KINGBA401_04836_RAHOLLJA_000_012","Once you arrive, she should not be difficult to find. These days, only a handful of Mamool Ja attempt the journey, most of them brutish mercenaries.
