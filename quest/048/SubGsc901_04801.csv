50,"TEXT_SUBGSC901_04801_LEWENA_000_002","It shouldn't come as any surprise, but the Gold Saucer has once again deigned to dream bigger. They now offer a host of precarious obstacle courses─which they refer to as “shows”─and lavish prizes to those who participate."

56,"TEXT_SUBGSC901_04801_FGSCOUNTERMAN04801_000_021","Aha, as I thought! Never fear, however, for I shall explain all. Blunderville is a set of battle royale obstacle courses fit for up to twenty-four challengers─and you, my intrepid friend, look like our very next one!"
57,"TEXT_SUBGSC901_04801_FGSCOUNTERMAN04801_000_022","Challengers are tasked with overcoming three particularly tricksy courses, and must race ahead of the pack if they wish to qualify for further challenges.

64,"TEXT_SUBGSC901_04801_FGSCOUNTERMAN04801_000_025","An excellent question indeed! Our diminutive friends here are known as the Beans. Their curious coloration and delightful charms inspired us to construct this very hall─and our shows, of course─with creative abandon!"
65,"TEXT_SUBGSC901_04801_FGSCOUNTERMAN04801_000_027","Though we know not where they originated from, we but recently discovered these little ones wandering the Gold Saucer. Their round physiques are reminiscent of legumes, so we eventually came to call them the Beans."
66,"TEXT_SUBGSC901_04801_FGSCOUNTERMAN04801_000_028","Be they voidsent or seedkin or something else entirely, they are adorably inquisitive creatures.

68,"TEXT_SUBGSC901_04801_FGSCOUNTERMAN04801_000_030","It is thanks to his efforts that we found common ground with them, and in turn, they grew comfortable enough to show off their unique proclivities...such as racing through every obstacle that comes their way!"
69,"TEXT_SUBGSC901_04801_FGSCOUNTERMAN04801_000_031","They may be a tad clumsy, but the spirit of competition that lies within them is a force to be reckoned with! Master Manderville was so moved by these displays, he immediately ordered the construction of this whimsical hall, that his new friends might have a place to frolic and play with others."
70,"TEXT_SUBGSC901_04801_FGSCOUNTERMAN04801_000_032","...Forgive me, was I rambling? Well, in any case, that, my good <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>, is how Blunderville came to be!"
