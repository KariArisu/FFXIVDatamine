1,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_SEQ_01","It seems that spreading the truth of Justiciar's character has had the desired effect, as Tepeke informs you that public opinion has shifted since his questionable actions were brought to light. She also shares a rumor that mysterious letters have been circulating among his most ardent followers in Radz–at–Han, and she is determined to ascertain the contents. She asks you to aid her by questioning residents in the western quarter of the city, where the impressionable youth are said to gather."
2,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_SEQ_02","While most in the western quarter seem to know only rumors of the letters or seem reticent to speak with you, one boy tells you that he overheard Zasshal the merchant mention the Justiciar in the vicinity of Mehryde's Meyhane, where he may yet be. You decide to head there and ask the merchant what he knows of the elusive charlatan."
3,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_SEQ_03","You come upon Zasshal cheering to the Justiciar's generosity, and after a bit of prodding from you, the merchant shows no scruple in spilling his client's secrets. He says that he was approached by the Justiciar, who purchased all the merchant's maps. Not soon after did letters appear in Radz–at–Han with a copy of a map leading to the Uznair canals. Although the details are yet unclear, it is plain that Virazahn is planning something there. Return to Radz–at–Han to share this discovery with Tepeke."
4,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_SEQ_04","Impressed at your investigative abilities, Tepeke guesses that the Justiciar's followers might gather at Palaka's Stand before departing for Uznair. She asks you to follow her there with haste, before the trail goes cold."
5,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_SEQ_05","You notice a few more youthful faces than usual around Palaka's Stand, and Tepeke has observed several clutching maps. Her presence has been noted, however, as none of the youths will allow her to approach, let alone speak with them. She concocts a plan to take advantage of their wariness─she will keep a half-hearted vigil in the hopes that one among their number attempts to slip past her gaze. You are to watch from a hidden vantage point and follow anyone who attempts to leave Palaka's Stand."
6,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_SEQ_06","As Tepeke surmised, one of the Justiciar's followers attempts to sneak past her and heads to the settlement's outskirts. Follow close behind to see where he might lead you.

※In the event of failure, return to the designated location to reattempt the objective."
7,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_SEQ_07","You follow the young man to the entrance to Uznair before confronting him, and he confesses that he was there to learn the truth of the rumors for himself. Deciding he would be better off at home, he entrusts the map to you. You and Tepeke then enter the canals, eventually reaching a chamber full of large rocks strewn about and a group of wounded people. In the center of all this stands Virazahn. He gives a grandiose speech, declaring his intent to become known as Radz–at–Han's greatest hero, before retreating behind a hail of stone, leaving the wounded behind to tell their tale. Apparently, the majority came as followers of the Justiciar, but when a duo of thieves brandished their weapons, he wielded the apex's powers against them, wounding friend and foe alike. For a blessing, none were mortally wounded, but Virazahn has once more escaped the hand of justice. After leaving the canals, Tepeke asks you to wait while she guides the people into the care of the Radiant Host."
8,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_SEQ_08","Having guided the wounded safely to the Radiant Host, your first encounter with Virazahn has ended with less-than-favorable results. However, the story of what happened in Uznair may deal a grievous blow to the Justiciar's reputation, and Tepeke is optimistic as she departs to Yedlihmad, bidding you to follow."
9,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_SEQ_09","As usual, Tepeke is unflappable in the face of Virazahn's escape, and seems almost heartened that your encounter has confirmed several theories about the treasure's powers. Certain that Virazahn's charade will soon come crashing down, Tepeke intends to cooperate with the Radiant Host to track him down before he lashes out in desperation. In the meantime, she asks you to stand ready to act once new information presents itself.

※The next role quest will be available from Tepeke upon reaching level 98 in any magical ranged DPS class."

138,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_THUG04843_000_337","That's when he started wavin' that thing about. We soon learned that the rumors of its power were true, and rocks started fallin' down around us."
139,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_ADMIRERWOMAN04843_000_338","Even us true believers were not spared! There was nowhere to run!"
140,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_ADMIRERWOMAN04843_000_339","The Justiciar said such power cannot be fettered, and that sacrifices are unavoidable. And all the while...he was laughing!"
141,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_ADMIRERWOMAN04843_000_340","We pleaded with him for mercy, but that just made him angrier. He flourished the object again, and yet more rocks assailed us."
142,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_ADMIRERWOMAN04843_000_342","It was horrible! Stones big and small raining down endlessly. Until you two appeared, that is."
143,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKKWE_000_343","Thank you for telling us what happened. I only wish we could have arrived sooner."
144,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKKWE_100_343","Now, just to set things straight─it was you two that brandished your weapons first, yes?"
145,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_THUG04843_000_344","Well, I won't deny that, but we were only tryin' to bring the truth of his misdeeds to light. Though we might've had some personal scores to settle on top of that..."
146,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKKWE_000_345","Before I left Palaka's Stand, I asked the Radiant Host there to look out for anyone returning from the wilderness."
147,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKKWE_000_346","I suggest you head there and seek their aid. While you're there, share with them what you just told us. And as for the pair of you, don't even think about running away, or you'll have us to deal with."
148,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_380","Everyone has returned to the care of the Radiant Host. As for those ruffians who meant to attack Virazahn, it seems they had a history of violence for which they may soon answer."
149,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_381","Several among Virazahn's followers were dealt serious wounds, but we can be grateful that none lost their lives."
150,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_382","It's exactly as the old saying describes: “The master of the apex shall be showered with good fortune, yet leave only sorrow in their wake.” The part about sorrow certainly seems true, at least."
151,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_383","We can but hope that Virazahn's spell over the people will be broken at last when word of what transpired here becomes common knowledge. Let that buoy our spirits as we return to Yedlihmad."
152,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_400","Well, that was certainly an ordeal. Although Virazahn got away, we can look back upon what transpired to plan our next course of action."
153,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_401","It appears that the treasure takes rocks from the surrounding environment and makes them rain down upon the wielder's surroundings."
154,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_402","However, the power seems to be somewhat...haphazard. While Virazahn himself wasn't struck, the boulders assailed friend and foe alike."
155,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_403","Something else has been nagging at me, as well...the stones we saw in the canals seemed quite a bit larger than the others. I don't know what to make of it, but I will give it some thought."
156,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_404","We still don't know exactly how he controls the apex's abilities, either. We must focus on these mysteries as we continue our investigation."
157,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_405","As for Virazahn himself, he was just as his father said, wasn't he? His so-called heroism is an empty charade, like a child playing at being a hero from their storybooks."
158,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_406","He seems motivated by a vain desire to gain the love of the people, yet he cares nothing for their well-being."
159,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_407","He'll learn his lesson soon enough, though. None will sing his praises after word of what happened at Uznair spreads. Even he must know this."
160,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_410","I worry that his desperation will drive him to worse misdeeds. If the treasure is used with reckless abandon, it could cause untold harm."
161,"TEXT_KINGBA531_04845_TEPEKE_000_415","I must discuss this with the Radiant Host. Together we might be able to capture Virazahn before he attempts anything drastic. Stand by for now, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─I'll be in touch the moment I have something to share!"
