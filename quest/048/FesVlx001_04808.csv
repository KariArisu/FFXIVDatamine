0,"TEXT_FESVLX001_04808_SEQ_00","Astrid is not-so-subtly indicating her desire for you to approach.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLX001_04808_SEQ_01","In need of a helping hand, Astrid de Valentione, head emissary of the Valentione's Day celebrations, asks that you check on the whereabouts of the apprentice emissary Emilie, who has been preparing a mysterious surprise for the day's festivities near Fen–Yll Fineries. Being the chivalrous soul that you are, you happily oblige. 

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLX001_04808_SEQ_02","You find Emilie practicing under the trees not a stone's throw from Fen–Yll Fineries. She is grateful for your concern but remains coy as to what exactly has kept her occupied for so long. She insists you return to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre if you wish to find out."
3,"TEXT_FESVLX001_04808_SEQ_03","Astrid thanks you for retrieving Emilie, who is now ready to reveal her surprise. As she performs the so-called “love heart,” you feel the slight fluttering of butterflies in your stomach. Explaining that she hopes this bold expression of affection will inspire others to act on their feelings, Astrid wishes you to join Emilie in displaying it for the townsfolk, but soon realizes that even two ardent souls may not be enough to cover all of Gridania. With perfect timing, Lisette de Valentione enters the stage, eager to lend her assistance. Your numbers thus buoyed, Astrid asks that you speak with her when you are ready to begin."
