1,"TEXT_KINGMA106_04865_SEQ_01","In response to Wuk Lamat's query, the Hanu warns that the region of Kozama'uka has been battered by the recent storm. Not only has the trail devolved into a muddy mess, but the village of Ok'hanu itself has suffered losses as a direct result of the tempest's wrath. Worried for the state of the Hanu people, Wuk Lamat bids you make ready to depart and assemble by the Arch of the Dawn."
2,"TEXT_KINGMA106_04865_SEQ_02","An elector likely awaits in Kozama'uka, and the time has come to seek them out. Thus do you and your comrades leave to retrace the steps of the Dawnservant."
3,"TEXT_KINGMA106_04865_SEQ_03","Your party makes their way towards Ok'hanu, following the road alongside the river. Wuk Lamat quickens her pace as the village draws near, leaving you and your Scion companions to continue on your own."
4,"TEXT_KINGMA106_04865_SEQ_04","Though somewhat awed by Wuk Lamat's relentless momentum, Krile trusts that Erenville will keep the Third Promise from getting lost or worse. With but one direction ahead of you, you proceed down the road presumably leading to your destination."

62,"TEXT_KINGMA106_04865_HANUHANUCOLLABORATOR4864_000_053","It is. Be warned, however: my brethren tell me the recent storm has rendered the path even muddier than usual. The footing is quite poor in some parts."
63,"TEXT_KINGMA106_04865_HANUHANUCOLLABORATOR4864_000_054","Far worse was the destruction visited upon our homes, though. Houses were torn apart, and several people injured if not killed. Even our beloved festival is in danger of being called off this year."
