2,"TEXT_KINGMB110_04889_SEQ_02","Wuk Lamat is not about to let the loss of a keystone slow her down. She makes a brief stop in Earthenshire to reassure Rediroq that all is well, then wastes no time stomping up the mountain path after Erenville."
3,"TEXT_KINGMB110_04889_SEQ_03","Your party reaches the end of the arduous trail, exhausted by the climb and the noticeably thinner air. Erenville shares some advice for enduring the heightened elevation, before encouraging you along the last few steps to Worlar's Echo."
4,"TEXT_KINGMB110_04889_SEQ_04","In response to Wuk Lamat's observations, Erenville explains that the Yok Huy are rarely seen in the lowlands─bound as they are to their duty of watching over the imprisoned Valigarmanda. The Third Promise briefly considers delaying the feats in favor of hunting down the thieving Bakool Ja Ja, but cooler heads prevail, and you head over to the temple to inquire after the whereabouts of the elector."
5,"TEXT_KINGMB110_04889_SEQ_05","You are granted entrance to Karryorzar the Gracious, and are immediately awestruck by the sight of the enormous Valigarmanda bound within its prison of ice. Zurmurwur, a temple priest, tells the story of Gulool Ja Ja's battle with the seemingly unbeatable tural vidraal, ending with the Skyruin's frozen fate. Putting concerns of melting ice aside for now, Zurmurwur passes on instructions from High Luminary Gurfurlur─the elector for the Feat of Proof. The challenge requires you locate the elector himself, hidden as he is somewhere within Urqopacha's vast mountain range..."
6,"TEXT_KINGMB110_04889_SEQ_06","Rather than simply rush off into the mountains in search of Gurfurlur, it is decided that gathering hints from the villagers is the wiser course.
