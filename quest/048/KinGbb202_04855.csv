1,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_SEQ_01","With the power of pictomancy now at your disposal, Kupopo is eager to teach you the basics of the art─though he would prefer to do so with a clear conscience. Having been made aware of the trouble he has caused with his solicitations, he wishes to apologize to the cheerless Hearer, and urges you to follow him to Nophica's Altar."
2,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_SEQ_02","While pleasantly surprised to receive an apology from Kupopo, the Hearer reveals that the moogle was not the sole source of his woes. An abandoned manor in the Gentry's Ward has been infested with noisemaking pests, and their clamor must be silenced. Reminding you that it is the spirit of the pictomancer to lend a helping hand, Kupopo deems this matter an opportunity for you to put your skills to the proof, and volunteers you to quell the threat."
3,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_SEQ_03","You make short work of the pests dwelling in the manor basement, ensuring that nearby residents can enjoy an untroubled sleep. Kupopo is pleased to see how quickly you are growing into your role, and suggests you return to Old Gridania to celebrate your success."
4,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_SEQ_04","Having addressed the Hearer's pest problem, you make your triumphant return to the Gentry's Ward gates. Kupopo will no doubt wish to discuss your progress further."
5,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_SEQ_05","Travel is essential to pictomancy, Kupopo explains, for the practitioner benefits greatly from new experiences. His lecture is interrupted, however, by the cheerless Hearer, whose expression transforms into one of relief when you inform him of your victory. He leaves a far happier man than he was when you met him, and Kupopo is thrilled to see the culmination of your selfless efforts. Before the two of you set off for a new destination, he reminds you to continue your training and remember your promise to help find his dear friend.

※The next pictomancer quest will be available from Kupopo upon reaching level 83."

49,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_KUPOPO_000_002","While a pictomancer's brush may look like a big paintbrush, it is in fact a stylized variety of staff. That said...you're probably wondering why we don't just use staves."
50,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_KUPOPO_000_003","Put simply, it's much easier to bring your imagination to life through the medium of art! Magicked brushes and ink allow a pictomancer to express abstract thoughts in a deliberate manner, kupo."
51,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_KUPOPO_000_004","As I mentioned, though, it's ultimately your imagination that matters the most. For with the wisdom of pictomancers past at your disposal, you already possess the artistic skills you require!"

56,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_KUPOPO_000_012","Indeed, I'm the one who caused you much trouble. It wasn't my intention to do so, and I've come to beg forgiveness, kupo..."
57,"TEXT_KINGBB202_04855_CONJURER04854_000_013","Oh, I see... As you appear to be genuinely remorseful, all I ask is that you refrain from aggressive solicitations henceforth. Agreed?"
