50,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_010","The shipwright's name is Wuk Evu. He's a Xbr'aal who only moved to Kozama'uka a few years ago, but has since mastered our customs to an almost frightening degree."
51,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_011","He's especially strict when it comes to manners, so make sure to offer him a proper Hanuhanu greeting. We wouldn't want to offend him right before asking a favor."

57,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_200_022","This is Ok'bek'be, the Village of All. Those who drift into Kozama'uka from Tuliyollal and elsewhere are welcome to live here alongside the Hanu."
58,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_300_023","As for Wuk Evu, he lives and works in the House of Waters High, at the top of that large tree nearby. Follow me, but I should warn you: the climb up the stairs can be challenging."

66,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_KRILE_000_060","Look, you can see the falls at the back of the cave! These hollows must have been carved out by the constant deluge of water from above..."
67,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_065","Cave Kikitola, as promised. Home to many deadly creatures. Venture inside if you feel confident, but I will conduct my own search out here."
68,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_066","You can spot raw abokixa by its green-hued glimmer. Bring anything matching that description to me."
69,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_KRILE_000_067","I shall help scour the inside of the cave, then. You take the west half and I'll take the east!"

71,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_SYSTEM_000_075","Upon closer inspection, you find that the glimmer you spied was just light reflecting off the water..."

73,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_SYSTEM_000_077","You find a chunk of stone glowing a distinct shade of green. This seems like the exact kind of mineral Linuhanu was looking for."
74,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_KRILE_000_080","Some of the cave's inhabitants took umbrage at my presence, but it was nothing a few swishes of my brush couldn't handle."
75,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_085","I picked over the ground near the entrance but found nothing. Did you have better luck inside the cave?"
76,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_086","Yes, this is abokixa. Along with Krile's contribution, we have more than enough for our needs."
77,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_087","The stones you've brought shine very brightly. I thank you both."

79,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_088","Truth be told, a good friend of mine was meant to be festival leader for this year's Ihih'hana."
80,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_089","But when that big storm hit, he...he did not survive. It fell to me to carry on in his stead."
81,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_KRILE_000_090","That was why you agreed to Wuk Lamat's request, despite your initial reluctance."
82,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_091","Yes. It hurt to hear, but she was right. Though I must mourn, I cannot let my grief consume me."

89,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKLAMAT_000_100","We just got back ourselves. Did you find the stone we needed?"
90,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_KRILE_000_105","I hope Wuk Lamat's foray was as productive as ours."
91,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_110","We've come too far to stop now. The Lifting of Wings must go on!"
92,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKEVU_000_115","Thanks to the Third Promise and her mighty swings, we've collected some suitable logs of uyuipo. What of the abokixa?"
93,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKEVU_000_116","Yes, these are excellent samples. A goodly quantity, too."
94,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKEVU_000_117","At this stage, you've likely surmised that the Lifting of Wings encourages the crops to grow─but not exactly <Emphasis>how</Emphasis>, eh?"

96,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKEVU_000_119","Now, to get to work crafting these pieces for the float. I could use an assistant versed in the arcane arts to enhance the uyuipo's conductivity..."

101,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKEVU_000_135","The final touches are fairly routine and shouldn't take long. Go ahead and wait by the float."
102,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_LINUHANU_000_140","As Wuk Evu said, the festival really is a spectacle to behold."
103,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKLAMAT_000_145","Gathering the uyuipo was a trial in and of itself."
104,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKLAMAT_000_146","At first, Wuk Evu criticized everything I did. Then he suddenly yelled “I've spoken ill of the Third Promise and must punish myself!” and proceeded to slam his head into an uyuipo tree..."
105,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKLAMAT_000_147","I told him not to worry about it─again─and it was like snuffing out a candle. He's an odd one, that's for sure!"
106,"TEXT_KINGMA109_04868_WUKLAMAT_000_148","At least we've seen to the poles and the new eye. Now we just have to wait for the feathers from the twins!"
