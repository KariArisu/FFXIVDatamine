1,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_01","With the soul crystal and dual blades of the viper now in your possession, Keshkwa wishes to instruct you in the basics of his art. For that, you will need to find suitable prey, so your new mentor suggests asking around Ul'dah for information on potential hunting grounds."
2,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_02","You soon learn of a spate of incidents in which travelers were attacked by packs of savage creatures near Spineless Basin. This information will surely be of interest to Keshkwa."
3,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_03","You relay the news of marauding beasts to Keshkwa, who is eager to assist the local community and commence your training. You depart the city in search of your quarry."
4,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_04","You find Keshkwa assisting some beleaguered adventurers who had barely survived an encounter with your chosen targets. The experienced tracker predicts that the beasts are close by, though before setting out, he expounds upon the origins of the viper's art, and the role of the dual blades in slaying large and powerful foes. Though your opponents are considerably less threatening than a viper's usual prey, they are nevertheless not to be taken lightly."
5,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_05","Under Keshkwa's watchful gaze, you demonstrate a natural flair for the viper's combat arts, and succeed in vanquishing the hordes of rampaging creatures."
6,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_06","Satisfied with your remarkable progress, your mentor confides in you the truth behind his journey here from Tural. He and his student had attempted to slay a deadly predator known as Iq Soq Xmajun, only for the fiend to kill Keshkwa's disciple before taking wing and crossing the ocean to Eorzea. In order to track his hated foe, the viper asks that you accompany him to Ul'dah and help gather information as to its whereabouts."
7,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_07","As Keshkwa's previous attempts at engaging with the citizens of Ul'dah were somewhat disheartening, he asks that you take the lead in making inquiries. In the meantime, he will observe and learn from your methods, and with luck become better equipped to gather information by himself. You cast your gaze over the crowds in search of knowledgeable locals. Emerald Avenue appears to have some promising candidates...

※You must be accompanied by Keshkwa to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
8,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_08","Your questioning reveals that while there have indeed been sightings of an unknown creature soaring across the sky, there is little in the way of useful information. Hoping to uncover more details, you head towards the Rudius.

9,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_09","The next individual with whom you speak shares rumors of a winged beast, though the finer details are somewhat dubious. Nevertheless, the exercise has proved productive, if only for the purpose of demonstrating to Keshkwa the conversational techniques he so sorely lacked."
10,"TEXT_KINGBB102_04849_SEQ_10","Keshkwa is determined to learn from your example and collect further information regarding Iq Soq Xmajun. However, given his lack of success thus far, this may take some time...
