1,"TEXT_KINGBB201_04854_SEQ_01","In Old Gridania you encounter a Hearer who is relieved you have not approached him to lodge a complaint like others before you. It would seem a mischievous moogle has been pestering adventurers in the aetheryte plaza in an attempt to involve them in a “painting endeavor” of some sort. You are advised to avoid this moogle...unless you happen to have artistic inclinations."
2,"TEXT_KINGBB201_04854_SEQ_02","It is easy enough to find the moogle who so fervently wishes to introduce “pictomancy” to all and sundry. Upon hearing you express interest, the moogle introduces himself as Kupopo and regales you with a brief history of this art. However, as he only has one soul crystal to share, he requires that you consent to an interview at the Carline Canopy, that he might assess your suitability for the role."
3,"TEXT_KINGBB201_04854_SEQ_03","Kupopo is satisfied by your answers to his myriad questions, and deems you a suitable inheritor for his soul crystal. But before he hands it over, he warns you that the soul crystal comes with a condition. Kupopo seeks to be reunited with a lost friend and requests your assistance in finding her over the course of your training. If you are willing to oblige him, you need only speak with him once more to reaffirm your commitment."

72,"TEXT_KINGBB201_04854_KUPOPO_000_032","A gifted artist as well as mage, Relm took up a brush instead of a staff, and wielded aether like paint to give shape to her imaginings."
