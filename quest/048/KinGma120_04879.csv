1,"TEXT_KINGMA120_04879_SEQ_01","Wuk Lamat is curious to know if Fonjeantaine will follow through with his resolution to practice his craft in Tuliyollal. She suggests heading back to Wachumeqimeqi to see if he has spoken with Ropli yet."
2,"TEXT_KINGMA120_04879_SEQ_02","You arrive in time to watch as Fonjeantaine finds his courage, and after explaining his situation to Ropli, the goldsmith successfully secures work as an artisan at Wachumeqimeqi. No sooner has he thanked you for your kind support than you receive a linkpearl call from Erenville. It seems he has finished making the necessary arrangements for your passage to the Moblin settlement."
3,"TEXT_KINGMA120_04879_SEQ_03","Much to Wuk Lamat's dismay, it transpires that Erenville has requisitioned a large, barge-like boat which is to be pulled by a placid marine creature known as a punutiy. Koana then makes an unexpected appearance, along with his heretofore hidden collaborators─Thancred and Urianger. Your fellow Scions are seemingly delighted by the prospect of competing against their Archon comrades; however, now is not the occasion for such a competition, as the Second Promise will not be traveling on the river. Koana and his entourage soon depart, leaving you to prepare for the potential dangers of a journey along Ihuykatumu.

4,"TEXT_KINGMA120_04879_SEQ_04","The contest takes you now to Kozama'uka. But what awaits on your river voyage remains to be seen..."
5,"TEXT_KINGMA120_04879_SEQ_05","Your plans to defend the riverboat are soon tested as Bakool Ja Ja releases wild creatures from his own barge to harass and harry you. Aggravated by your prowess, the two-head then turns his attention to your punutiy, wounding the creature and damaging the front of your vessel. Erenville is thus forced to ground the boat while you scout on ahead.

A perilous detour through an abandoned Yok Huy mine sees you encounter Koana and his entourage─yet while the meeting does not come to blows, they delay your progress nonetheless. Eventually, you emerge near the river, where you are rejoined by Erenville, Alisaie, and the recovered punutiy.

Your group sets off again and presently arrives at Dock Tumu. Encouraged to let her guard down by you and your companions, it seems Wuk Lamat has much to think about as you make for the nearby mountain camp..."
6,"TEXT_KINGMA120_04879_SEQ_06","Wuk Lamat gathers her thoughts, at last persuaded that sharing her burden is not only accepted but encouraged. The campsite at the top of the Flight of We Wingless should provide a comfortable place for her to confess how she truly feels."
7,"TEXT_KINGMA120_04879_SEQ_07","An innocent question from Alisaie prompts Wuk Lamat to tell the story of her childhood with Gulool Ja Ja, culminating with the inadequacy she feels when compared to her accomplished brothers. With the aid of you and Krile, however, the Third Promise comes to better understand what it is that truly drives her. She resolves to continue her journey and to learn more of her beloved nation and its peoples as she walks a path of her own making."
8,"TEXT_KINGMA120_04879_SEQ_08","In sharing her worries with her comrades, Wuk Lamat feels as though a crushing weight has been lifted from her breast, and she can take a full breath at last. Free from the burden of her self-imposed expectations, she is eager to carry on."
