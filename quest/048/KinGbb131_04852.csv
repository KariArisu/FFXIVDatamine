1,"TEXT_KINGBB131_04852_SEQ_01","With the aromatic diffuser pouches now complete, everything is in place to put their creature-repelling capabilities to good use, and corner Iq Soq Xmajun. Innocent Stork has proposed the Dravanian hinterlands as an ideal location for confronting your target."
2,"TEXT_KINGBB131_04852_SEQ_02","In Dravania, Keshkwa asks that you scout the area for places from which you might stage an ambush. While the ruins provide much in the way of cover, you will also need enough space to fight to your full potential."
3,"TEXT_KINGBB131_04852_SEQ_03","You have identified several possible locations for an ambush, though each has its own distinct advantages and disadvantages. For now, though, you must return to Keshkwa and offer your thoughts."
4,"TEXT_KINGBB131_04852_SEQ_04","Keshkwa is shocked to discover that one of the diffuser pouches has been placed here in the Dravanian hinterlands. As its aroma repels creatures with a heightened sense of smell, the pouch would serve to keep Iq Soq Xmajun away from the very place in which it was meant to appear. Suspecting foul play on the part of Innocent Stork, you resolve to pursue her, following your only available lead to western Coerthas."
5,"TEXT_KINGBB131_04852_SEQ_05","You arrive to find that Innocent Stork has succeeded in capturing Iq Soq Xmajun, though she deliberately sacrificed her bodyguard in the process. To add to your woes, you learn that your supposed ally Golias is undoubtedly in league with her. Dispensing with all pretense, Innocent Stork reveals that she is a collector of rare and dangerous creatures who delights in setting them upon hapless victims. Another such beast appears seemingly from nowhere, catching Keshkwa unawares and temporarily incapacitating him. It falls to you to slay your mentor's assailant."
6,"TEXT_KINGBB131_04852_SEQ_06","After felling Innocent Stork's pet, you rush to Keshkwa's aid. For a blessing, it seems that only his pride was hurt, though he would probably appreciate a helping hand all the same."
7,"TEXT_KINGBB131_04852_SEQ_07","Keshkwa struggles to comprehend all that has occurred. Not only has Innocent Stork shown her true colors, she now has Iq Soq Xmajun caged and ready to be unleashed whenever and wherever she chooses. With nothing left for you in Coerthas, Keshkwa suggests returning to Quarrymill to assess all that has transpired."
8,"TEXT_KINGBB131_04852_SEQ_08","Despite Iq Soq Xmajun having been captured, the situation is more dire than ever. Now that Innocent Stork has the formidable tural vidraal at her disposal, there is no telling what horrors she will orchestrate, nor where she will strike next. With no viable leads to follow, Keshkwa offers to investigate your opponent's whereabouts, and bids you continue your training for the time being.

※The next viper quest will be available from Keshkwa upon reaching level 90."
