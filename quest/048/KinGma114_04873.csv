173,"TEXT_KINGMA114_04873_WUKLAMAT_000_209","This one's already fully dressed─an artisan or peddler, perhaps? Come to rest after visiting Wachunpelo, like Bol Noq', would be my guess."
174,"TEXT_KINGMA114_04873_WUKLAMAT_000_210","That Mamool Ja is armed. Could be a Doppro courier? I've seen them flying their wivres, and those types aren't fond of excessive clothing either."
175,"TEXT_KINGMA114_04873_WUKLAMAT_000_211","Let's see. No coat or cloak...but also no weapon? Oh, we might have a winner!"

177,"TEXT_KINGMA114_04873_WUKLAMAT_200_211","So professional fighters like those of the Landsguard would have little interest. Though the same could be said of any Turali who prioritizes ease of movement in their work..."

179,"TEXT_KINGMA114_04873_HOOBIGOANXIETY04873_000_213","Oh, it was no choice of mine, believe me! I was attacked by beasts on the way here, and barely escaped with my scales intact. My coat was not so lucky."

183,"TEXT_KINGMA114_04873_WUKLAMAT_000_217","We'd be willing to part with it, if you'd like to make a trade. For one of your fine tools, perhaps?"

187,"TEXT_KINGMA114_04873_HOOBIGOANXIETY04873_000_221","Wonderful! A fine garment such as this should put me on even footing with any Pelu merchant."
