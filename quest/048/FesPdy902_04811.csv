※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_01","The royal seneschal appears to be Peatie's biggest fan, and he invites both her and Aldemund to Ul'dah, that the goobbue might be the star attraction of this year's Little Ladies' Day. Requesting your assistance in comforting Peatie as she becomes accustomed to the crowds, he departs to Ul'dah to make preparations for her grand debut. Aldemund and Peatie have business to attend to in Gridania before they follow, so the performer asks you to go ahead and await their arrival.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_02","The royal seneschal informs you that the planning committee for Little Ladies' Day has agreed to welcome Peatie with open arms, and now he asks you to help do what you can to spread the same sentiment among the city's populace. He bids you travel to the Steps of Thal and drum up interest in the coming entertainment."
3,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_03","While not everyone you speak with is accepting of a goobbue in their city at first, you manage to convince several to attend the show, with some even expressing excitement at the prospect. Who knows how far their enthusiasm might spread? As the show draws near, all that remains is to visit the stage and report your success to the royal seneschal."
4,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_04","You arrive at the stage on Emerald Avenue to see a crowd much larger than the one in Gridania, all waiting in anticipation. It seems the presence of so many expectant guests has caused Peatie to freeze up, but Aldemund suggests that you /rally her spirits to shake her out of this fluster."
5,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_05","Although Peatie is initially too frightened to respond to your encouragement, a few heartfelt words manage to break her loose from the clutches of fear and give her a newfound sense of determination. With the goobbue ready for her big show, you can now join the crowd and cheer for her success."
6,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_06","Peatie takes the stage and dazzles all present with her performance, earning a hearty applause that makes her beam with pride. The royal seneschal appears eager to speak with you after this roaring success."
7,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_07","The show is the talk of Ul'dah, and Peatie basks in the people's adoration. Realizing that she is meant to keep on this road and that his best days as a performer are behind him, Aldemund asks that you take his companion along on your adventures. You accept the now-famous goobbue into your company without hesitation, and the royal seneschal and Jihli Aliapoh encourage you both to enjoy the remainder of the celebrations in Ul'dah and Gridania. With so much merrymaking across the realm, smiles will come easy for some time yet."
