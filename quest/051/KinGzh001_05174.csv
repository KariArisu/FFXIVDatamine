The tenacious tour guide appears to have some unfinished business."
1,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_SEQ_01","On the streets of Canal Town, you come across a young guide in a rather excitable state. Eager to share his tale, he explains how his last tour came to an abrupt end when his customers vanished from existence. Seemingly unwilling to leave the job unfinished, he invites you to take the tour instead, and bids you rendezvous with him by the Font of Devotion.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_SEQ_02","You find the tenacious tour guide by the fountain, where he delves into the myths surrounding the water feature. Armed with a few tidbits of knowledge, you head to the eastern side of Canal Town to see what else the young man has in store for you."
3,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_SEQ_03","In the second half of the tour, you learn about the Font of Devotion─a much-loved location back in the resort's glory days. Pressing an old coin into your palm, the young guide encourages you to make a wish."
4,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_SEQ_04","Channeling your wish into the timeworn coin, you cast it into the still pool of the fountain. The tour guide watches on, waiting to speak with you again."
5,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_SEQ_05","The young man reveals that despite his many years as a guide before becoming an Endless, he never got the chance to make a wish of his own. Seizing the moment, he throws a coin into the font, where it sinks to rest beside yours. The guide thanks you for indulging him before fading out of existence, having finished his final tour."

51,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_003","Now, Canal Town wouldn't be Canal Town without its water, and where better to dip your toes into the local history than in two of our storied fountains? Come, I'll be waiting for you by the Font of Devotion!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_004","There you are! For such an obliging participant, I'll have to pull out all the stops!"

54,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_006","Given that the town prides itself as a resort of revitalization, there could hardly be a more fitting fountain. Whether you believe the old tales about its healing waters is another matter...ahem."
55,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_007","Myths are myths, after all! I hope you aren't too disappointed..."
56,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_008","Nevertheless, though its waters may be decidedly mundane, the font still lives up to its name! Over the years, crowds have flocked to the fountain, invariably leaving soothed and refreshed. For those who display such devotion, perhaps there <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> something to be gained from a gulp or two!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_009","I hope that whet your appetite, because another fountain awaits! Come and find me on the eastern side of town."

59,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_011","You stand before another storied fountain. These waters are said to bring happiness to whoever tosses in a coin!"
60,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_012","And if you are already blessed with happiness, I'm sure a different wish wouldn't go unanswered! Plenty of folks used to do just that in days gone by."

71,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_019","A secret? Haha, don't worry, I won't try and force it out of you!"
72,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_020","You know, I've given this tour countless times, but not once have I made a wish myself."
73,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_021","And not because I pour scorn on the legends or anything like that! I just never got round to it... But thanks to you, I got to finish my tour. To mark the occasion, I think I might just toss a coin in!"

76,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_024","I worked here as a tour guide in my former life too. Before it became a home for the Endless, Living Memory was open to living, breathing folk seeking relaxation and revelry."
77,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_025","Boy, did I guide a lot of people back then! I never tired of sharing my knowledge and hearing visitors' wonderful stories!"
78,"TEXT_KINGZH001_05174_GUIDE05174_000_026","I suppose that's why I took up the same job as an Endless. And I'm proud of that. Proud of staying true to myself."
