The distant lowing coming from the far reaches of Lake Toari seems to indicate something is amiss."

48,"TEXT_KINGZE020_05138_ENCIERRO05138_000_000","Well met, traveler. Have you perhaps seen a rroneek calf around here? I spotted a youngster south of Lake Toari─it seemed like they'd gotten separated from their kin."
49,"TEXT_KINGZE020_05138_ENCIERRO05138_000_001","With all the hungry fiends that roam the area, the poor beast doesn't stand much of a chance without someone to protect it. The thing is, I'm just not cut out to defend it from any would-be predators."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE020_05138_ENCIERRO05138_000_002","You, on the other hand, seem more than capable of handling yourself... Would you be willing to seek out the calf and escort it back here in my stead? They ought to be somewhere to the south of the lake."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE020_05138_ENCIERRO05138_000_010","As I said, I spotted the calf near the southern shore of the lake. Can I count on you to bring them back safely?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZE020_05138_LOST05138_000_020","Mrrroooh!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZE020_05138_SYSTEM_000_021","The lost rroneek calf eyes you expectantly."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE020_05138_SYSTEM_000_022","Escort the lost rroneek calf safely to its owner. Should you fail to defend the calf, or move too far away, it will return to the starting position, where you may rendezvous with it before trying again."

59,"TEXT_KINGZE020_05138_SYSTEM_100_017","You have lost sight of the lost rroneek calf. Retrace your steps to find it, then escort it safely to its owner."

64,"TEXT_KINGZE020_05138_ENCIERRO05138_000_032","Though if you manage to get there before the fiends and raise a calf from a young age, they make for excellent beasts of burden."
