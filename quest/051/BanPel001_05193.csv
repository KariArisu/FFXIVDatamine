※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANPEL001_05193_SEQ_01","In Bayside Bevy you meet Liplu, a childhood friend of Mablu's, who was apparently waiting for you to pass through. Delighted, the young Pelupelu quickly launches into a proposal, offering you the role of special advisor for her new venture, the Turali Travel Agency. She does not expect an immediate response, though, and requests that you visit her in the Kozama'uka village of Ok'hanu should you wish to know more.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANPEL001_05193_SEQ_02","You receive a warm welcome from the enterprising Pelu and her associates in Ok'hanu, who go on to state their main goals for the travel agency. Inspired by Vow Wuk Lamat's experience of growing to love her people even more by getting to know them better, many Turali are eager to learn about their neighbors, and Liplu's new travel agency would serve to facilitate such experiences. Moreover, this venture would help to revitalize Kozama'uka, which is still in the process of rebuilding following the recent great storm. Liplu wishes to further explain her plans, however."
3,"TEXT_BANPEL001_05193_SEQ_03","Liplu informs you that the core business will be to provide accommodations and guided tours of the local area. After you officially consent to assist as a special advisor, she immediately asks that you help by assessing plans for prospective tours. She bids the three guides head to the sites of their respective tours, and gives you a moment to catch your breath."
4,"TEXT_BANPEL001_05193_SEQ_04","Without further ado, you and Liplu venture forth to listen to the plans of the Hanu guides, beginning with Genuhanu, who awaits you in the Fields of Gold."
5,"TEXT_BANPEL001_05193_SEQ_05","Genuhanu details his idea to show guests around the reed fields that dominate the landscape. Liplu in turn suggests including a tour of the village, providing visitors with an insight into the local way of life, and thus the context to appreciate the crucial role that reeds play in Hanuhanu culture. Leaving the Fields of Gold behind, you head for Breath Between to speak with Zelihali, who has another potential tour in mind."
6,"TEXT_BANPEL001_05193_SEQ_06","You find the Hanu gazing at the raging waters feeding into Ku'uxage. Snapping out of her reverie, she reveals her plan to take visitors on a linguistic and historical stroll along the river. After offering your insights, you set off to meet Xenuhanu outside Cave Kikitola, that you might assess yet another tour idea."
7,"TEXT_BANPEL001_05193_SEQ_07","The soon-to-be guide speaks of the cave's cultural significance and breathtaking natural beauty. Liplu sees the potential for a truly special experience, but one best reserved for experienced travelers, given the remote location and threat of fiends in the area. You leave Xenuhanu to finish fine-tuning his plan, and make your way back to Ok'hanu."
8,"TEXT_BANPEL001_05193_SEQ_08","You rendezvous with Liplu in the Hanu village, where the young Pelu mulls over what exactly the Turali Travel Agency will provide its customers. She invites you to join her by Dock Poga, where Yubli and Wuk Evu have been establishing the agency's base of operations."
9,"TEXT_BANPEL001_05193_SEQ_09","While expressing her determination to make the venture a success, Liplu informs you that construction is ready to begin. You watch on as Wuk Evu leads his team of laborers, who are soon heaving the last timber into place. The newly built Turali Travel Agency is almost ready to open its doors. Only time will tell what awaits you as the fledgling enterprise's special advisor."
