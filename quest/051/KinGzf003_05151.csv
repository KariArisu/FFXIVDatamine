49,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_001","The machines here run on electrope, so the capacitor serves as a battery, storing the lightning energy as it rolls in from all the pylons we've erected."
50,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_002","If you're interested, I'd be happy to show you around and tell you more about our system!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_003","Piqued your curiosity, eh? First, let's head downstairs to see the power converter!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_SYSTEM_000_006","The electrope enthusiast is now accompanying you. Keep him at your side in order to proceed with quest objectives."

64,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_014","That's our food storage facility. By converting lightning energy to ice, we've created a refrigeration system that can prevent spoilage."
65,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_015","It's a godssend, I'll tell you that. These parts get a lot of rain and humidity, so if we didn't have refrigeration, we'd have a massive mold problem on our hands. "
66,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_016","After lightning energy is absorbed in the electrocapacitor, it's transmitted to this power converter."
67,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_017","Its function is to stabilize and distribute appropriate levels of energy to each household and facility."
68,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_018","...You look lost. Are you more of a visual learner? Let's pay a visit to the partitioned water tank on the north side of town."
69,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_019","Right, so, after lightning energy is allocated to the residential grid, it's utilized in a variety of ways, one of which is that tank there."
70,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_020","Normally, it's a receptacle for filtering rainwater. By using electrope to convert the lightning energy to fire, however, we can have hot water readily available at any time!"
71,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_021","Amazing, isn't it? Lastly, let's go and have a look at the control tower just up the stairs."
72,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_022","These panels enable us to freely adjust each of the public utilities individually."
73,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_023","The utility manager monitors the operational status of each facility, keeping an eye out for any problems. Not a glamorous job, but it's important work."
74,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_024","Well, I think that about covers it! Let's loop back around to the electrocapacitor, shall we?"
75,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_025","So, how'd I do? Hopefully I've answered all your most burning questions."
76,"TEXT_KINGZF003_05151_ADAPTERS05151_000_026","Believe it or not, I'm not actually an engineer─just an apprentice. I was inspecting the capacitor when you arrived."
