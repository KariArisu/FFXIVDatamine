Upon learning you have spent time in Radz–at–Han during the course of your adventures, she bids you share what you know of Hannish cuisine with Wawkesa, that he might adapt the eatery's menu to their visitor's particular tastes."
3,"TEXT_BANPEL005_05197_SEQ_03","After giving the Tonawawtan chef some culinary pointers, you join Liplu in welcoming your guest to Kozama'uka. It transpires that this is not your first encounter with Rasafbaht, whom you eventually recall having seen among the alchemists who converged upon Estinien in the Great Work, eager to conduct a thorough examination of the dragoon. Delighted to learn that you are already acquainted with their visitor, Liplu invites you to join them on the tour, and suggests you wait in Dock Poga whilst Rasafbaht unpacks."

With the tour at an end, Liplu wishes to speak with you in the Fields of Gold."
5,"TEXT_BANPEL005_05197_SEQ_05","As Rasafbaht recounts her personal highlights from the tour, you learn that her visit was born of a desire to deepen understanding between Radz–at–Han and Tuliyollal, and has left her yearning to learn more about the people of Tural. Thrilled by this statement, Liplu proposes the group return to Dock Poga, where you are to rendezvous with Tseeya."
6,"TEXT_BANPEL005_05197_SEQ_06","After expounding further on the Wing of Reflection's motivations, Tseeya commends the efforts of the Turali Travel Agency and pledges to secure formal backing for the enterprise.
