Kayamene wants to know more about the strange, white crystals you found in the Maw of Sansheya."
1,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_SEQ_01","Kayamene knows of one whose knowledge of the local area exceeds all others. She suggests you go to meet with this woman in the nearby village of Luwateninyawawsa, the place where she was born and raised.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_SEQ_02","The woman she has brought you here to meet, Neshtezi, is most likely doing the rounds of the village. She asks that you inquire with the field hands to learn her current whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_SEQ_03","The field hand tells you that Neshtezi recently chased a mischievous child from the fields, and the two fled into the alleys. He bids you follow in their footsteps."
4,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_SEQ_04","You find the boy, who tells you that after angrily chiding him for his misbehavior, Neshtezi continued with her rounds, going to call on a certain village maiden. Though he knows not where this lady lives, he is sure in the belief that another lady standing nearby is her sister."
5,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_SEQ_05","You speak with the lady, who points you in the direction of her sister's house."
6,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_SEQ_06","You find Neshtezi and show her the stones you plucked from the Maw of Sansheya. She reacts with fury, explaining that the stones were all that was keeping the blue blobs from plunging into the inferno and reviving their maleficent master. She demands that you return the stones to the Maw immediately."

48,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_000","Looks like these stones are the only clue we have to go on. Let's go and ask my grammy if she knows anything about them."
49,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_001","Neshtezi, her name is. Lives over in Luwateninyawawsa, the village where I grew up. It's just on the other side of the butte. Come on!"
50,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_002","Neshtezi isn't actually my grandmother, you know. She's one of the village elders, who takes her duties more seriously than most. She's always out and about, keeping an eye on everyone─whether they like it or not."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_003","Let's split up and try to find her. You take the right side of the main street, I'll take the left."
52,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_CITIZENA05146_000_005","Old ma Neshtezi? Sure, I've seen her, and not long since. One of the village kids was playing around in the fields, and she didn't take too kindly to it. Chased him up that street there, saying she was going to give him the hiding of his life for damaging the crops."
53,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_CITIZENA05146_000_006","I feel sorry for the kid. If there's one thing I learned growing up, it's that you never want to get on Neshtezi's bad side. Fingers crossed he got away."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_CITIZENB05146_000_007","...Sorry? My ears are still ringing from the chewing out Grammy gave me. I thought I could outrun her, but she was too fast."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_CITIZENB05146_000_008","If you're looking for her, she said she had to call on one of the ladies in the village. Only thing stopping her dragging me home by my hair... The lady's sister lives just up the hill, there. She'll be able to show you which house it is."
56,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_CITIZENB05146_000_009","I can't believe Grammy's still so fast. Only one thing for it─next time, I've got to be faster!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_CITIZENC05146_000_010","...You're looking for Neshtezi? She went to see my sister. She's with child, you see. Grammy made a charm for a safe birth, and wanted to give it to her in person. The house is just back around the corner, under the butte."
58,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_CITIZENC05146_000_011","Neshtezi's such a kind lady. Always thinking about other people."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_012","Hm? Who are you? What do you want?"
60,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_013","Ah, you found her! Excellent work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
61,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_014","Friend of Kayamene's, are you? And I see she's got you running errands for her, as usual... Whatever you want, make it quick. I've got places to be."
62,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_015","We wanted to ask you about these stones. We found them in the Maw of Sansheya, and thought you might know something about them. Here..."
63,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_016","FOOL OF A GIRL!!!"
64,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_017","It's one of the warding stones that keeps the beast from coming back! And you picked it out and brought it here? Are you reckless, or just plain stupid?"
65,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_018","I-I didn't mean anything by it! I just wanted to know what it was!"
66,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_019","Then shut your mouth and open your ears, while I tell you the tale of the blue beast..."
67,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_020","Time was it stalked these lands─a demon of burning, blue flame, that would rise up from the Maw on a moonless night to wreak fiery death across all Shaaloani. Only when its thirst for destruction was finally sated would it fade to nothing."
68,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_021","But its evil spirit lived on, welling up from the underworld and taking the shape of its minions─the devil's droplets, that would throw themselves into the fiery pits to summon up their master once more."
69,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_022","Our ancestors knew that whenever those thrice-damned things appeared, it was only a matter of time before the blue beast rose again. Until a young miner from the village made a discovery that would change our fate forever."
70,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_023","He found a strange, pale ore in Yowekwa Canyon that seemed to drive the droplets away. A stone in each pit, and that was the last we ever saw of the beast."
71,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_024","Thought it was the last we ever <Emphasis>would</Emphasis> see of it, but then you decided to get it into your stupid head to go paddling about in a pool of hellfire and run away with the only thing that was keeping us safe!"
72,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_NESHTEZI_000_025","You go and put those stones back where you found them this instant, and I'll <Emphasis>think</Emphasis> about sparing you the lash!"
73,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_026","Gods, my poor heart! If they were so important, she could have told me about them before..."
74,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_027","Well, better late than never, I suppose. After hearing all that, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
75,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
76,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_A2_000_000","That the “devil's droplets” and the “blue blobs” are one and the same?"
77,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_A2_000_001","That stones like these are just what we need to keep the blue blobs away?"
78,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_028","They have to be! And the stones we found must be the same ones the miner threw in the pits to keep them away."
79,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_029","Right! Assuming that the “devil's droplets” she mentioned are the blue blobs by another name, we can use stones like these to ward them off."
80,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_030","We only started seeing the blue blobs a few years back, right around when the ceruleum drilling business took off. Maybe that's what summoned them up from underground─the sound of the drills stirring their master from his slumber."
81,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_031","They need to throw themselves in burning ceruleum to summon their master, but with the stones keeping them away from the Maw, they're searching for it elsewhere. That explains why we've seen them around the wells and the plant."
82,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_032","They're following the scent of ceruleum, like we thought─and as soon as they find a blue flame, like the flare stacks on top of the rigs, or the tools of the engineers servicing the processing plant, they'll summon up their evil master once more..."
83,"TEXT_KINGZE303_05146_KAYAMENE_000_033","Th-They'll summon up their master once more! We need to get these stones back in the pits, and fast!"
