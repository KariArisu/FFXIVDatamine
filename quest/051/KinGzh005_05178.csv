The restless Milalla is fearing the worst."
1,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_SEQ_01","You are accosted by a restless Milalla, who begs your assistance in rescuing defenseless animals from Matchlock Menagerie's hungry scorpions. Before you can ask any further questions, however, the Milalla darts off towards the menagerie, assuming you will not be far behind.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_SEQ_02","The Milalla is horrified to discover the volcanic scorpions stalking a pair of diminutive creatures. Unable to contain his emotions, he blindly charges towards the scorpions in hopes of deterring them, and you must seek him out before the worst comes to pass."
3,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_SEQ_03","Though you swiftly slay the scorpions, the Milalla is frozen in fear, and requires a helping hand to jolt him back to reality."
4,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_SEQ_04","As he regains his senses, the Milalla reports his good tidings─the small animals have escaped unharmed. Before he rushes on ahead to fetch them, he proposes the two of you continue your conversation back at the menagerie entrance."
5,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_SEQ_05","Upon your return, the Milalla informs you of his previous life as a worker at the menagerie, and reveals that the scorpions were originally introduced as a means of recreating Alexandria's once-famous scorpion vodka. While he regrets what has become of the menagerie ever since, the Milalla finds some comfort in your efforts to rescue the surviving wildlife, and expresses his thanks to you before he departs."

48,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_000","You! Yes, you! With the weapon! Pardon my candor, but you must accompany me to Matchlock Menagerie <Emphasis>this instant</Emphasis>!"
49,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_001","...What? No, I'm not asking you on a leisurely outing! I'm asking you to save innocent lives! I spied a trio of volcanic scorpions stalking after some defenseless animals."
50,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_002","Were I to vanish and allow the scorpions to prey upon those creatures, I'd never forgive myself! We must make for the menagerie and defend them, no matter the cost."
51,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_003","Obviously, I can't chase off a nest of hungry pests alone. I require strength─specifically, your strength. Step lively, then! We've no time to lose!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_004","I-I saw them! I saw the scorpions! They're closing in on two tiny critters as we speak."
53,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_005","Those volcanic monstrosities terrify me...but what terrifies me more is knowing what they'll do to their quarry if we don't act swiftly!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_006","W-W-Worry not, little ones! I'm on my waaaaaay!"
55,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_007","Gods, I thought that was the end of me! That took every drop of courage I could muster..."
56,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_008","Thankfully, the little ones managed to escape without a scratch. I ought to find them and lead them to the entrance before the other scorpions catch us in their sights... I'll meet you back there when all is well!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_009","You, my weapon-wielding friend, are a lifesaver! I realize this all escalated rather quickly, but you performed admirably under the pressure."
58,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_010","To tell the truth, I have a bit of a history with those scorpions."
59,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_011","In my previous life, I was tasked with introducing new and exciting creatures into Matchlock Menagerie, that our guests might know the wonders of the animal kingdom."
60,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_012","As one might expect, the prospect of scorpions posed a great risk, and we often argued with the upper management as to whether keeping them would be worth the cost. In the end, however, the menagerie's curator ordered us to take them in."
61,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_013","Supposedly, scorpion-based vodka was a popular delicacy in Alexandria before the war. The higher-ups sought to recreate those drinks and share them with the masses by way of a new exhibit."
62,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_014","Time passed, and I finally returned as an Endless...only to discover the menagerie in shambles! Those thrice-damned scorpions have the run of the place now."
63,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_015","<sigh> I should have argued against the curator's plans when I had the chance... I should never have agreed to that terrible exhibit!"
64,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_016","No matter how hard I tried to let things go, those pangs of regret never abated. So when I spotted those innocent creatures wandering into the menagerie, I felt obligated to return─to save what little I could."
65,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_017","Thanks to you, my conscience is clearer, and our fuzzy new friends are none the worse for wear!"
66,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_Q1_000_018","What will you say?"
67,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_A1_000_001","Did these two originally belong to the menagerie?"
68,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_A1_000_002","Perhaps these little ones were seeking out some hot springs."
69,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_019","They must have...but I don't recall bringing in such precious pups. Perhaps one of my associates introduced them after I left."
70,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_020","You may be onto something! Some species do love a good soak... If that's the case, they might've lost their way on the road to Opal Springs."
71,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_021","Regardless, I can rest easy in the knowledge that these two will have each other, even when I'm long gone. I should be able to escort them to safety from here."
72,"TEXT_KINGZH005_05178_RESTLESSMILALLA05178_000_022","You have my deepest gratitude─and presumably theirs, as well!"
