※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUX001_05182_SEQ_01","Mayaru Moyaru has informed you that the Moonfire Faire is presently being held in Costa del Sol. Travel to Eastern La Noscea and speak to Haermaga, the chief chaperone, to learn more.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUX001_05182_SEQ_02","In the midst of your conversation with Haermaga, a bloodcurdling scream rends the air. Clearly some manner of threat has descended upon the Faire, but what? Track down the terrified tourist to find out."
3,"TEXT_FESSUX001_05182_SEQ_03","The terrified tourist is quick to inform you that a strangely off-kilter creature has fled to the west. Perhaps there are more clues to be found in that direction."
4,"TEXT_FESSUX001_05182_SEQ_04","According to the sweaty guest, the mystery creature was green in color and appeared to be doing a jig. It eventually traipsed away, though not before conveniently leaving behind what appeared to be part of its body. Further investigation will surely lead you to answers."
5,"TEXT_FESSUX001_05182_SEQ_05","Truth be told, the needle left behind at the scene is enough to clue you in to the creature's identity. Sure enough, when Beaudefoin and P'obyano come running up moments later, your theory proves correct: there are cactuars on the loose, and now it's up to you to track them down."
6,"TEXT_FESSUX001_05182_SEQ_06","You locate the cavorting cactuar, and a refreshing gust from Beaudefoin's uchiwa succeeds in calming it. Unfortunately, there are six more still unaccounted for. Trusty uchiwa in hand, you and your companions must now set off to soothe the rest of the savage beasts."
