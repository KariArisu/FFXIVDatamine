51,"TEXT_KINGZF005_05153_DORIAN_000_003","From the look of you, you can handle your fair share of danger, yes? Could you go out to the Thunderyards and see if you can find them for me?"

56,"TEXT_KINGZF005_05153_DORIAN_000_008","The hunter told me everything. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for taking such swift action!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZF005_05153_DORIAN_000_009","These soldiers require energy gathered from lightning, and yet lightning also proves to be their weakness. Apparently, it took a nasty jolt in the Thunderyards and went berserk."
58,"TEXT_KINGZF005_05153_DORIAN_000_010","Honestly, why are they tinkering with offensive output when they could be correcting this glaring flaw in the design? Rest assured, the engineer in charge will hear <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> about this in my report..."
