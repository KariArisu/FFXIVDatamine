※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLX002_05185_SEQ_01","Perhaps put off by the ghoulish ambience of the amphitheatre, Philcox complains of being unable to concentrate and takes his leave. You set off after him, steeling yourself for whatever shenanigans await.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLX002_05185_SEQ_02","Philcox's grasp of Gridanian geography appears to be somewhat lacking. He has requested that you, with your superior knowledge of the local thoroughfares, lead him to the flustered fellow he has located with his powers.

※You must be accompanied by Philcox to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_FESHLX002_05185_SEQ_03","Together with Philcox, you locate your quarry, who proceeds to divulge the source of his woes. It seems he found and promptly <Emphasis>un</Emphasis>found a lost child, and lacks the time to look for her due to a prior engagement. You and the fiend offer to look for her in his stead, and set off towards Westshore Pier to search for the distressed damsel."
4,"TEXT_FESHLX002_05185_SEQ_04","Brimming with confidence and buoyed by his recent successes, Philcox manages to reunite the young girl with her mother. He then sets out to find yet another despairing personage, and this time without your assistance. At his suggestion, you return to the pumpkin-headed apparition at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, bearing news of Philcox's exploits."
5,"TEXT_FESHLX002_05185_SEQ_05","The vying voidsent can only boast a single cookie apiece, and so their contest ends in a draw. A slightly defiant Philcox gets the recognition he has long sought from his former partner, before being reminded that the prize for which he should strive is the affection of the good folk of Gridania─and the foodstuffs that may be had into the bargain. Fiend-sitting duties at an end, you are free to make the most of All Saints' Wake."
