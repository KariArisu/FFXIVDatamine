48,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_000","Well, look at you! Bold as brass, and twice as tough, I'd wager. Maybe you could help me out?"
49,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_001","See, I moved here a few years ago to get into the ceruleum business, but before that, I worked as a miner over in Tonatenyawi."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_002","Back then, I had me a favorite pickaxe, with a yeheheceyaa engraved into it. I figured I had no more use for it, so I left it behind. But with all the recent turmoil, I've found myself pining for it, as a reminder of a time when life was simpler."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_003","I'd go back and get it myself if the whole place wasn't swarming with cutthroats, and that's where you come in. You look like you could hold your own, or at least manage to sneak in and grab the pickaxe before any of them notice you. Think you could give it a try?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_006","The pickaxe probably hasn't gone far, unless those bandits found a use for it. Now there's a worrying thought..."
53,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_SYSTEM_000_007","This pickaxe is engraved with an image of a yeheheceyaa, just as described."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_SYSTEM_000_008","This pickaxe does not have anything engraved into it, besides the usual scratches one might expect."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_SYSTEM_000_009","Although this pickaxe features an engraving, it depicts some sort of nopalitender. This is not the pickaxe you are looking for."
56,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_010","Any luck finding my pickaxe?"
57,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_011","Well, I'll be damned! That's it!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_012","Of course, now that mining is a thing of the past, I didn't think I'd ever need this thing again. But then I realized, there might be a way to use the skills I learned as a miner in the ceruleum industry."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_013","And if I ever have a chance to swing a pickaxe in the future, there's none I'd rather turn to than my old favorite. Thanks for sticking your neck out and bringing it back to me!"
