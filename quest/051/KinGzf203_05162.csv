Nakente has an idea of where Shaloaci might have gone."
1,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SEQ_01","With Shaloaci nowhere to be seen, one can only assume she is still reading Yyupye's report. Nakente sends you to find her at the control tower, the young woman's favorite haunt.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SEQ_02","Fortuitously, Shaloaci has finished reading the report by the time you arrive. It outlines a tentative countermeasure to protect the farmland, but will require the use of a specific device said to be located at Yyasulani Station. Rather than risk another solo venture, Shaloaci has asked you to accompany her there. Once your preparations have been made, you are to rendezvous at Yyupye's Halo."
3,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SEQ_03","Yyasulani Station is no small hop from the outskirts. Given that Shaloaci has much to discuss along the way, however, the journey should be a breezy one.

※You must be accompanied by Shaloaci to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
4,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SEQ_04","Upon arriving at Yyasulani Station, Shaloaci promptly retrieves the device from its storage location. Along with an overview of its function, she recounts to you the other things she learned from Yyupye's report─namely, that the farm was to be entrusted to the woman's daughter once she came of age. Needless to say, the implication is clear. As for what Shaloaci will do with this newfound knowledge, it seems not even she has the answer yet. For now, the two of you had best head home with your prize."
5,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SEQ_05","With Yyupye's transformer safely in hand, you and Shaloaci make the long journey back to the outskirts. The exorays remain to be dealt with, but for the time being, both of you could surely do with a good, long rest."

62,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SHALOACI_000_021","According to the report, the cause of the declining harvest is an infestation of exorays─a type of toxic slime mold."
63,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SHALOACI_000_022","With the electrope pillars fertilizing the soil, everything in the ground stands to benefit, good or bad. That's why the farmhands weed the fields so aggressively."
64,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SHALOACI_000_023","But by hiding out of sight under the topsoil, the exorays have had free rein to draw vital nutrients away from the crops. The more they multiply, the smaller our yields."
65,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SHALOACI_000_024","In short, if we're to save the crops, we'll need to exterminate the exorays. And to do that, we'll need the device that's stored at the station. Are you with me?"
66,"TEXT_KINGZF203_05162_SHALOACI_000_025","But what I don't understand is why Yyupye would store the report and the device in two separate locations. Wouldn't it have been easier to put them both in the box?"
