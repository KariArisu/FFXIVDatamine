The lively lass is looking for a playmate."
1,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_SEQ_01","You encounter a young girl who has devised quite the elaborate puzzle, and soon find yourself tasked with testing it out. With the first clue fresh in your mind, you set off to discover what lies hidden in the streets and alleys of Yesterland.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_SEQ_02","Having skillfully deduced the girl's initial riddle, you discover the hidden clue next to a stack of crates by the entrance to Yesterland. You attempt to read between the lines as you ponder the next location."
3,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_SEQ_03","The second riddle leads you to Starglass─more specifically, to one of the four streetlamps surrounding the plaza. Armed with another clue, you prepare to roam the deserted streets once again in search of the next hiding place."
4,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_SEQ_04","After poring over the words of the third riddle, you end up amongst the shrubs behind an empty house. Time to see where the final clue leads."
5,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_SEQ_05","You solve the final riddle with aplomb and rendezvous with the lively lass. Once you provide the correct password, she shares her thought process behind setting the clues and devising the game. The girl expresses her gratitude before bidding you a fond farewell─leaving you bereft of a playmate, but with a newfound sense of what Yesterland was to the Endless who called it home."

49,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_001","Unbelievable! It took me ages to think of all the clues and hide them around town! I guess it was all for nothing..."

70,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_019","Now that you've finished, I thought I'd tell you how I came up with my clues!"
71,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_020","The first clue was “By yesterday's gate stands a tiny mountain piled high.” Of course, I meant the entrance to Yesterland and the stack of crates a few steps away!"
72,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_021","There was one kid who used to hang around by the gate and make sure any newcomers quickly got the lie of the land! Pretty nice of them, right?"
73,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_022","All right, time for the next one! The “four lamps” looming over “streets of glass”─well, they're the streetlights in Starglass! The bit about “one true light” shining on Her Majesty is because you were supposed to look for the streetlamp closest to the Meso Terminal!"
74,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_023","From there, you can see Queen Sphene's statue from in between the air cab rails! Quite the sight, huh?"
75,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_024","For the third part of the puzzle, my clue was “Over the river, in sight of the spiral, behind the pointy hat hide the shrubs you seek.” The “river” I'm talking about is the old electrope river, and the spiral is the air cab station staircase!"
76,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_025","And the “pointy hat”? Easy. That's the building with the funny-shaped roof. Whenever we used to play hide-and-seek, it was always a popular spot─I figured it'd be a great place to leave a clue!"
77,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_026","The last clue about the princess waiting for your return─well, I wrote that because princesses live in castles, and that's where I was waiting!"
78,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_027","I bet you're dying to hear about the password too, right!? “I want to be your canary” is the code we'd use when we needed to keep something secret. It's the title of an old play about a princess who falls in love with a commoner."
79,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_028","That's the great thing about this game─it's not just about having fun, it's also a great introduction to Yesterland for anyone who's just arrived!"
80,"TEXT_KINGZH003_05176_GIRL05176_000_029","Everyone knows about the Bergmähr-Ring and the esperance wheels, don't they? I wanted to take folks off the beaten trail, and make sure they learned our password."
