※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_SEQ_01","Not content to rest on her laurels, Liplu has already identified a new area into which she might expand the Turali Travel Agency: Earthenshire. Behind the scenes, the enterprising Pelu has been sounding out the Moblins regarding her plan. You are to attend a meeting with Liplu at Zanuhali's residence, where the results of these discussions will be revealed.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_SEQ_02","At the meeting, Rediroq the Moblin expresses her enthusiasm for the prospect of visitors flocking to Earthenshire, yet questions the logistics of such a plan. In response, Zanuhali offers an unexpected solution: an ancient rite to imbue punutiys with the power of flight, thereby making the upper reaches of Kozama'uka more readily accessible. Eager to begin preparations, Liplu bids you speak with her again."
3,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_SEQ_03","Before leaving for Tuliyollal in search of beastkeepers and punutiys, Liplu assigns you the unglamorous task of gathering reeds for the Hanu's flight-giving effigy. Gonahanu awaits your arrival in the Fields of Gold."
4,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_SEQ_04","The friendly Hanu gives you unfettered access to the paddies, insisting you take as many reeds as you need. You prepare to harvest a suitable quantity."
5,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_SEQ_05","Having selected a fine crop of the lushest reeds you could find, it is time to visit Lanuhali in Kozanuakiy to make your delivery."
6,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_SEQ_06","You hand over the freshly harvested reeds to Lanuhali, who explains that she and her fellow Hanu will be responsible for completing the effigy. Liplu will no doubt be keen to hear of your progress."
7,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_SEQ_07","Thanks to the Hanuhanu and their wind magicks, the punutiys are now capable of flight. With the gentle airborne giants permanently housed at Dock Poga, the Turali Travel Agency is poised to expand into upstream Kozama'uka. More ground to cover will no doubt entail more responsibilities for the agency's special advisor, but you steel yourself for the challenges ahead."

49,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_001","And our new policies and training are all paying off─not a single one of our customers has been accosted by fiends. Needless to say, they find the presence of their guides-turned-protectors thoroughly reassuring!"
50,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_002","Still, a few issues have come to light. First and foremost, our reach."
51,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_100_002","So far, our tours have been limited to downstream Kozama'uka, but many guests have expressed a desire to see the region's upper reaches."
52,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_003","With that in mind, I contacted Mablu and asked her to gauge how receptive the Moblins might be to the whole tourism concept."

59,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_REDIROQ_000_010","The peddler mentioned your proposal to bring tourists to Earthenshire, and we should be glad to welcome them with open arms! The potsworn were very supportive too."

61,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_012","Though I have to ask─what if our customers distract your artisans from their work? I'd hate for this arrangement to negatively impact Earthenshire's trade."

74,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_021","A handful of punutiy barges ply the waters between upstream Kozama'uka and Tuliyollal, but there's no direct route to the downstream region."
75,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_022","The massive waterfall that lies between complicates matters. Traveling by boat, you have to head downstream, then join Ihuykatumu and double back. It's quite convoluted."
76,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_ZANUHALI_000_023","But there is an alternative. Though seldom used since the Flight of We Wingless was built, we Hanu once imbued punutiys with the gift of flight, enabling them to transport passengers over the falls."
77,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_ZANUHALI_000_024","The method requires vast quantities of reeds, hence why we were unable to employ it during the rite of succession. But this might be the perfect occasion to revive the old ways."

79,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_026","Of course, we'll need staff well versed in punutiy care. Which is why I've already reached out to some beastkeepers! Part of me balks at the idea of spending all that pel..."

84,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_031","But let's first ensure that there will be additional profits to share in the first place..."
85,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_GENUHANU_000_032","We'll need a large effigy to channel our wind magicks into the punutiys, and for that we'll need plenty of reeds, not to mention reams of cloth stitched with aether-enriched flight feathers... But you can leave preparations for the latter to us Hanu."
86,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_033","I have business in the capital, so I'll procure the punutiys. Come to think of it, I'll have to commission Wuk Evu to build an enclosure for them too."
87,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_034","Which leaves the reeds... I realize this is grunt work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but permit me to entrust the harvest to you."

91,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_GONAHANU_000_041","The plants nearby are ready to harvest. Feel free to take as much as you need. After all, we have you and your friends to thank for the bumper crop!"

97,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LANUHALI_000_047","I wasn't expecting such a haul! Thank you. Together with the reeds my fellow Hanu have collected, we should have enough to construct the effigy."
98,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LANUHALI_000_048","The first step will be to dry the reeds with a little help from our wind magicks. Once the effigy itself is complete, all that will be left to do is swaddle it in special cloth."
99,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LANUHALI_000_049","You needn't worry about the details, though. We'll see to the rest! Return to the travel agency in case they have need of you there."

101,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_051","Ah, there you are! I just got back myself. The beastkeepers are on their way with the punutiys as we speak."
102,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_052","Once the creatures are capable of flight, it'll be a quick hop to Earthenshire. I'm planning to offer bespoke tours for customers wishing to purchase potsworn crafts straight from the source!"
103,"TEXT_BANPEL003_05195_LIPLU_000_053","Thankfully, Wuk Evu agreed to work on the enclosure. Once the effigy is finished, we'll just need to wait for Zanuhali to arrive!"
