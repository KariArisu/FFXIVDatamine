49,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_KIPESHPE_000_003","It's a simple thing, really. Just a small delivery of nopales and tuna."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_KIPESHPE_000_004","Take these to Nikawtenhe at the saloon and Tsanaya by the rroneek stables. When you're finished, come back here, and I'll see if I can't put together a little something for your troubles."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_KIPESHPE_000_007","You won't have to go far─just to the saloon and the rroneek stables. I promise to make it worth your time."
52,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_NIKAWTENHE_000_015","Welcome, friend. If you're looking to wet your whistle, I've got just the thing."
53,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_NIKAWTENHE_000_016","Why, this is the nopales and tuna I ordered! I certainly wasn't expecting you to be the one to deliver it."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_NIKAWTENHE_000_017","If you've never tried them, I highly recommend it. Removing the needles can be something of a hassle, but nopales can be used for all sorts of cooking."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_NIKAWTENHE_000_018","And the tuna can be used for desserts if you peel them, or squeezed to make juice. "
56,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_NIKAWTENHE_000_019","Thank you for the quick delivery."
57,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_TSANAYA_000_025","Gods, am I thirsty..."
58,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_TSANAYA_000_026","For me? From the nopales farmer? His timing is impeccable as always."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_TSANAYA_000_027","Water-laden as they are, nopales and tuna can be lifesavers when you're traveling about the wilds."
60,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_TSANAYA_000_028","Lucky for me, they make great feed for the rroneek, as well. My thanks for the delivery, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>sir</If>."
61,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_NIKAWTENHE_000_029","My thanks again to the farmer. There really is nothing more refreshing than fresh nopales and tuna."

64,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_KIPESHPE_000_036","And what did you think, seeing their elation for a delivery of fresh nopales? Pique your interest? Or maybe even worked up your appetite?"
65,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_KIPESHPE_000_037","You'll rarely find it eaten anywhere outside of the wilds, but someday, I hope to share the joys of nopales cuisine with all of Tural─no, the world!"
66,"TEXT_KINGZE003_05121_KIPESHPE_000_038","A far-fetched dream, perhaps, but so long as travelers like yourself happen to be passing through, that's one more person I can reach."
