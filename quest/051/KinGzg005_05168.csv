49,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_BUSYFACILITATOR05168_000_001","As a matter of fact, you might be able to help me. In the wake of the recent disturbance, we've been overwhelmed with aggrieved citizens."
50,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_BUSYFACILITATOR05168_000_002","I'm steadily working through the backlog of claims, but ideally I'd like to hear from as many citizens as possible. And I'm well aware there are some matters the people are hesitant to broach with an official such as myself."
51,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_BUSYFACILITATOR05168_000_003","On the other hand, I think they might be inclined to speak frankly with one of the city's saviors. As you can imagine, this is a matter of some urgency, and your help would be much appreciated."
52,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_BUSYFACILITATOR05168_000_004","Please listen to what the citizens here in Resolution have to say. And remember, nothing is too trivial or trifling─anything you can glean is of use to me."
53,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_BUSYFACILITATOR05168_000_005","Lend an ear to the citizens and make a note of their grievances. I'll be grateful for any information you can provide."
54,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_ELDITE05168_000_010","Hmm? You want to hear my story? Well... My workplace was destroyed during the attack, which means I'm out of a job."
55,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_ELDITE05168_000_011","Times like these are precisely when you need a decent stock of souls, but no job means no credits, and without credits... Please, you've got to find me some work!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_MILALLA05168_000_012","My soul stock is down to zero after getting caught up in that damned raid─if those bastards had gunned me down one more time, I'd have been gone for good! And what's being done about all this? Nothing!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_MILALLA05168_000_013","What's more, I hear the king himself had a hand in that awful mess. I have half a mind to bill the city for all those spent souls! That'll show 'em!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_HYUNE05168_000_014","After the attack, I found myself endowed with a small fortune. Inheritance, apparently. But that begs the question: did someone near and dear to me pass away?"

64,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_BUSYFACILITATOR05168_000_021","Hmm. It seems that many have been left traumatized in the wake of the attack. It's also been alarming to see how many citizens were subjected to repeated deaths and revivals in such a short space of time. Such accounts are...unprecedented."
65,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_BUSYFACILITATOR05168_000_022","The concerns surrounding souls and employment are understandable too. It goes without saying that our resources are limited, and with the best will in the world we can't hope to respond to <Emphasis>every</Emphasis> claim..."
66,"TEXT_KINGZG005_05168_BUSYFACILITATOR05168_000_023","Nevertheless, it is clear that more must be done to support the citizens through this trying time. Thank you for your assistance."
