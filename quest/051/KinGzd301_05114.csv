Shiidil Ja's eyes are brimming with tears."
1,"TEXT_KINGZD301_05114_SEQ_01","Barely able to restrain her panic, Shiidil Ja explains that she and her husband, Gotoll Ja, were attacked by vicious wivres outside the city. He managed to distract them long enough for her to flee, but she fears the worst and begs you to go and find him near Golmajiik Grove.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZD301_05114_SEQ_02","You arrive outside Golmajiik Grove to find Gotoll Ja cornered by a host of enraged wivres. The beasts stand little chance against your martial prowess, however, and you turn to see what assistance you can lend the ailing man."
3,"TEXT_KINGZD301_05114_SEQ_03","Gotoll Ja thanks you, casting a second glance at you as he takes in your obviously foreign appearance. Nevertheless, he bids you rejoin him in Mamook to receive proper compensation for your heroic deed."
4,"TEXT_KINGZD301_05114_SEQ_04","Shiidil Ja is overjoyed by her husband's return and thanks you profusely for your assistance. Gotoll Ja was once a mercenary but was forced to retire after a serious injury. He expresses no little bitterness over his current impotence in battle, but curiosity regarding the wivres' strange behavior overpowers his discouragement. That such normally gentle creatures would be driven to an aggressive frenzy is baffling─and he would have your help in discovering the source of their ire..."

66,"TEXT_KINGZD301_05114_GOTOLLJA_000_029","It's unheard of for wivres to attack Mamool Ja, so we need to determine what's going on before someone gets injured."
