Evidently, breathtaking views of the Eshceyaani Wilds are enough to make one forget their responsibilities."

48,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_DIRECTOR05137_000_000","Hello there, traveler. Could I trouble you with something? My colleague hasn't showed up for her shift, you see. I figure she's daydreaming over on Mount Loazensasaya again."
49,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_DIRECTOR05137_000_001","I'd go fetch her back myself, but I can't leave the yard─not when there's work to be done. Would you mind going in my stead?"
50,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_DIRECTOR05137_000_002","Mount Loazensasaya's to the west of here. It's a great big boulder─you can't miss it."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_DIRECTOR05137_000_003","When you find my colleague, tell her she's needed back at the yard. Oh, and the view from the top of the mount is incredible, so feel free to take in the scenery while you're at it."
52,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_DIRECTOR05137_000_004","Tell my colleague I need her back on the job, and do be sure to enjoy the view."
53,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_ENGINEER05137_000_005","Can I help you with something?"
54,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_ENGINEER05137_000_006","Oh, it's that time already, is it? Sorry you had to traipse all the way out here on account of me..."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_ENGINEER05137_000_007","It's so easy to lose yourself in this wonderful view. Why don't you take a moment to look around while you're up here?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_ENGINEER05137_000_008","You can see all the way across the Eshceyaani Wilds from here. How about taking a moment to enjoy the scenery?"
57,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_ENGINEER05137_000_009","Stunning, isn't it? The plains, the settlements, the great bridge to Tuliyollal... All in a single sweep of your gaze."
58,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_ENGINEER05137_000_010","This place has changed so much in the last few years. I know some find the transformation unsettling, but for me, I can't help but feel excited."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_ENGINEER05137_000_011","Still, I don't want to forget the way things were before. That's why I come here so often: to commit the scenery to memory before it changes again."
60,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_ENGINEER05137_100_011","To tell you the truth, that dome showing up has put me on edge. But I think there'll come a day when I get used to the sight of it. I hope..."
61,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_ENGINEER05137_000_012","Anyway, I better get back to work. Thanks for coming to check up on me! Please give my apologies to the foreman."
62,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_DIRECTOR05137_000_013","Thanks for your help, traveler. My colleague got back a few moments ago."
63,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_DIRECTOR05137_000_014","The engineer you spoke with─she's Tonawawtan, just like me. For those of us who call the plains home, Mount Loazensasaya is a place of comfort."
64,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_DIRECTOR05137_000_015","From that vantage point, our ancestors convened with the winds and the lands themselves. Perhaps my colleague was doing much the same. At any rate, she seemed bright-eyed and eager when she got back."
65,"TEXT_KINGZE019_05137_DIRECTOR05137_000_016","Anyway, I ought to get back to my duties. Good luck out there on the road."
