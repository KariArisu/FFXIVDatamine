0,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_SEQ_00","The pumpkin-headed apparition is on the lookout for an able adventurer.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_SEQ_01","The pumpkin-headed apparition informs you of an unfortunate fiend unable to enjoy the All Saints' Wake festivities. At her behest, you go to meet Papa Gruff near the Greatloam Growery to learn more of this voidsent, and see if you cannot aid them in some manner or another.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_SEQ_02","It transpires that the fiend in question is none other than Papa Gruff's erstwhile partner, Philcox. Alas, it seems that, due to creative differences, the pair has disbanded. Dutifully, you set forth to seek out Philcox and hear his side of the story."
3,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_SEQ_03","You find Philcox in a somewhat frenzied state. As you are unable to hold a productive conversation with him, you have no choice but to /soothe him before attempting to speak with him again."
4,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_SEQ_04","With some gentle gesturing, you are able to render Philcox more amenable to dialogue. He explains his lack of talent for magicks, yet also alludes to another talent altogether: the ability to detect negative feelings within people. Having been apprised of his circumstances, you follow Philcox to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, where he intends to have a few words with the pumpkin-headed lady."
5,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_SEQ_05","With you by his side, providing the necessary moral support, Philcox lays bare his thoughts and feelings before the pumpkin-headed apparition. After a little coaxing and a few leaps of logic─from the point of view of a voidsent, at least─Philcox realizes he can use his powers to help the commonfolk, and in doing so garner their appreciation in the form of gastronomic gifts. Boasting of his newfound potential to Papa Gruff, the latter suggests a contest to determine whose approach is superior. You can but pray their rivalry does not get out of hand..."

51,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_PUMPKIN_000_011","On this night do fell fiends emerge to cavort and careen, unconcerned with the judgments of those on high. For the halls of the saints' heavenly abode ring with merriment as the wine flows freely─and no one can be bothered to look down."

54,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_PUMPKIN_000_014","And how do I propose to accomplish this feat? Binding obligations, friend. I've convinced the more sinister sorts to enter into contracts which forbid them from preying on mortals. In exchange, they are permitted to partake in the festivities. But there's one troubled soul who still seems incapable of getting into the “spirit” of things."

79,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_PHILCOX_000_092","I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell you my tale... Try as I might, I just can't get the hang of transformation magicks, and without the means to delight the crowds, we're starved for appreciation."

92,"TEXT_FESHLX001_05184_PHILCOX_000_132","Erm, I suppose I could give that a go... But do you really think that if I rid people of their woes, they'll repay the favor? I'm unfamiliar with mortal customs, but if you say so..."
