Shaloaci is eager to mitigate the mushroom menace."
1,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SEQ_01","Now that Nakente has been brought up to speed, an impassioned Shaloaci invites you to reconvene with her at the control tower. For the purposes of this exoray extermination, it seems there is one last thing you will need.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SEQ_02","Newly outfitted with a communication device, you are now fully equipped to coordinate your efforts with Shaloaci's. Make your way to the fields of Yyupye's Halo and await further instructions. "
3,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SEQ_03","Over the communicator, Shaloaci has steeled you for the fungal fight ahead. Once the exorays show themselves, you are to slay every last one of them, then repeat the process at the other side of the field. Hopefully by the time you have run out of mushrooms to crush, Shaloaci will be waiting for you near the bridge."
4,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SEQ_04","With the exorays routed, Nakente makes it clear that Shaloaci has every right to step down from managing Yyupye's Halo. But in finding the last traces of her mother, it seems the young Shetona has also found her confidence. In rising to the challenge of her new post, she has inherited both the farm and her mother's legacy."

49,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_001","Perfect timing, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I just finished explaining everything to Aunty here."
50,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_002","You know, I always wondered why the government would reassign you to Yyupye's Halo. I never imagined you were the founder's daughter!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_003","Honestly, I think they would have been better served choosing someone who was there from the beginning. Someone like you, Aunty."
52,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_004","I don't even remember my mother, and yet it's because of her that I was promoted to head of the Halo. I may not be qualified to solve all of the farm's problems, but I can at least solve this one!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_005","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, it's about time we evicted those unwanted tenants. Once you're ready to get your hands dirty, meet me at the control tower. There's one last thing I think we'll need."
54,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_006","Oh, for heavens' sake. Here I thought she was worried over something serious."
55,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_007","If anything, we were relieved that a local was chosen for the role. Sure, she may be inexperienced, but we all know she's got a good head on her shoulders. She'll grow into it in time!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_008","I understand this whole ordeal has been a lot of trouble, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but I want you to know how much I appreciate all your help."
57,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_009","Now, I hope you'll forgive a little worrying on my part, but you do realize fructified exorays are essentially mushroom monsters, yes? They're more troublesome than they look, so please be careful."
58,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_010","I know Shalo cares about this town and the people in it. To me, that's all that matters."
59,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_011","There you are! Are you ready, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
60,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_012","As soon as I integrate this transformer into the control tower's circuitry, those electrope pillars are going to send lightning straight into the ground."

64,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_016","(-Shaloaci-)As soon as I activate it, the exorays are going to come crawling up at full speed. There's no telling how many we ought to expect, so be on your guard!"
65,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_017","(-Shaloaci-)<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! How'd it go out there? Are you hurt? How many were there, anyway?"
66,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_100_017","(-Shaloaci-)Wow, you're incredible! You don't even sound out of breath!"
67,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_018","(-Shaloaci-)Well, if you're ready for round two, I'll reroute the transformer to the fields on the other side. Once you're all done, meet me near the bridge!"
68,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_019","Goodness me! That was quite impressive for someone without a regulator!"
69,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_020","I really owe you one, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! With any luck, the exorays should be well and truly exterminated."
70,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_021","There's now the matter of changing the soil, of course─and taking measures to prevent future infestations─but thanks to you, the Halo is on the road to recovery!"
71,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_022","Shalo, dear. Do you still have misgivings about your reassignment?"
72,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_023","None of us are upset by the idea of you taking charge of the Halo. The only thing that matters is how you feel about taking up the position."
73,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_024","If this isn't the life you want, it's not too late to change your mind, you know."
74,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_025","Thanks, Aunty, but I think I'll be just fine."
75,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_026","It's always been my dream to give back to the community that raised me. The way I see it, I've just been given a more direct opportunity to do so."
76,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_100_026","I only needed a little time to come to terms with it, that's all."
77,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_027","When I was walking to Yyasulani Station with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I remembered that I used to make the same trip with someone else. Yyupye, probably. I think she used to tell me stories of her homeland."
78,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_028","She built this farm so that our people could survive in the outskirts, but I don't think that was ever her dream. Deep down, I think what she wanted more than anything was to rebuild Tesh'pyani and the station."
79,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_029","That's a dream I'd like to see realized, and it can't be done if I'm content to stay here in the outskirts."

81,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_031","Oh dear. Should the coinkeeper be concerned, I wonder?"
82,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_NAKENTE_000_032","Now then, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, if it weren't for you, we may have never gotten to the bottom of this mystery. At the risk of repeating myself, thank you for helping. And for caring."
83,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_033","You've helped us more than you'll ever know."
84,"TEXT_KINGZF204_05163_SHALOACI_000_034","And I actually really enjoyed our little trip to the station! Next time I have business out there, you'd better clear your schedule!"
