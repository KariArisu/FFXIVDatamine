Kayamene asks for your continued assistance in finding a way to counter the blue blobs' bane."
1,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SEQ_01","As Neshtezi told it, the stones her ancestors placed in the Maw of Sansheya to ward away the blue blobs were mined from Yowekwa Canyon. Kayamene asks that you accompany her there to try to find more of the same stone.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SEQ_02","You join Kayamene in the canyon and split up to search it for similar stones to the ones you found in the Maw."
3,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SEQ_03","On examining what appears to be a bone protruding from the sand, you find that it is in fact a calcified fossil that bears a striking resemblance to the warding stone. Kayamene will no doubt be curious to see what you have found."
4,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SEQ_04","Kayamene examines the fossil and remembers another old legend that provides a possible explanation for its blob-repelling properties. Alas, such fossils are few and far between, and mining them in sufficient quantities to keep her company's operations safe would require a significant outlay─one the overseer is unlikely to be willing to lay out. Zitekkwa, however, may prove more pliable."
5,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SEQ_05","You meet with Zitekkwa in the Hhusatahwi saloon. He is eager to hear more of Kayamene's proposal and heads downstairs to meet with her."
6,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SEQ_06","Feeling that he owes you a debt for your previous assistance, Zitekkwa agrees to finance the mining operation. Kayamene invites you both to Sheshenewezi Springs, that together, you might win over her parsimonious overseer."
7,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SEQ_07","After hearing the testimony of his two employees, the overseer reluctantly agrees that the blue blobs do indeed pose a threat to his company. However, it is Zitekkwa's prediction that they will pose a threat to all Shaaloani if left unchecked, together with his willingness to provide the funds necessary to see the mining operation established, that finally convinces him to agree to Kayamene's plan. While the others head inside to discuss the terms of Zitekkwa's loan, Kayamene remains behind to offer you a word of thanks for supporting her till the end."
8,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SEQ_08","Thanks to you, life in the wilds has become a little more livable. Perhaps one day, it will be a place where people can not merely survive, but thrive."

49,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_002","Yowekwa Canyon's to the south of town, near Luwateninyawawsa. Remember, we're looking for more of that stone we found in the ceruleum pits. Understood?"
50,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_003","Alright! Then let's head out!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_004","The warding stones were a lot paler and more crystalline than the rest of the rock around here. Let's split up again─give me a shout if you find anything that looks like the stuff we found in the pits."
52,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_005","Find anything yet? No, me neither. Keep your eyes peeled for anything pale and shiny."
53,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SYSTEM_000_006","An interestingly shaped stone among the pile catches your attention, but alas, there is nothing pale nor shiny about it."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SYSTEM_000_007","The sandstone wall is made up of layers of a hundred hues: red, ocher, and gold. Alas, none is of quite the same shade as the warding stone."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_SYSTEM_000_008","You pull one of the bones from the sand, and a chunk breaks off─a surprisingly heavy, surprisingly crystalline chunk, whose resemblance to the stone you found in the Maw of Sansheya is unmistakable."
56,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_010","No use. I've looked and looked, but all I can see is sand. Well, that and sandstone. Did you have any better luck?"
57,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_011","This is it! The same stuff as the warding stone! Where did you find it?"
58,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_012","...A bone, you say? I remember my grammy telling me about something like that. She said that when an animal dies in the desert and its bones are swallowed by the sand, they take on the aspect of the earth below, gradually turning to stone."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_013","But if it's a great beast─a powerful beast─it's the earth that takes on the animal's aspect instead, and the sands around it become imbued with its aether."
60,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_014","That must be why the blue blobs stay away from the Maw of Sansheya. They can yet sense the beast whose bones these once were, and they're afraid of it!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_015","But if we want to keep all of our operations safe, we're going to need a lot more stones like this, and that's going to take a lot of digging."
62,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_016","If the overseer's not willing to pay for a few guards, I doubt he'd give us the gil to open up a whole new dig site..."

64,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_A2_000_000","If it's gil you need, I know someone who might be able to lend you it."

66,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_017","You do!? Friends in high places, eh? Suppose you make a lot of them in your line of business, helping folk out as you do. Anyone I know?"
67,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_018","Heh. If you were, I doubt you'd be here, scrabbling in the dust with me. Still, you go around doing favors for folk, right? Anyone with particularly deep pockets owe you a debt you could pass onto us?"
68,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_019","...Zitekkwa, the moneylender? I know him, if only by reputation─but what a reputation it is! Let's head on over to Hhusatahwi and ask if he can help!"
69,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_021","You should be the one to talk to Zitekkwa. I'd only get in the way."

72,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_030","Thanks for introducing us, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I gave Zitekkwa the gist of things. He says he's thinking about it..."
73,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_ZITEKKWA_000_031","So, if I understand the situation correctly, Kayamene here needs to mine fossilized beast bones, but her management's too tight to foot the bill..."
74,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_ZITEKKWA_000_033","All right, then. Let's go and have a little talk with this overseer of yours. See if we can come to some arrangement."
75,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_034","R-Really? You don't need to hear anything more?"
76,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_ZITEKKWA_000_035","What more is there to hear? If <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> vouches for you, that's good enough for me. I owe <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> a debt, and I mean to pay it. Besides, this proposal of yours sounds like it could be of benefit to the whole of the wilds."
77,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_036","Thank you! In that case, let's head over to the Springs right away! You too, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
78,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_ZITEKKWA_000_040","I see many familiar faces here. The laborers may earn their coin in the Springs, but they spend it in Hhusatahwi."

80,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_TAWZENZA_000_042","Sorry to keep you waiting, folks. I'm Tawzenza, the man in charge of ceruleum operations around these parts. I understand you have a proposition for me?"
81,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_KAYAMENE_000_043","Yes, sir, we do. It's about the beasts that have been prowling around the plants..."
82,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_TAWZENZA_000_044","...And you're sure these stones really do ward the “blue blobs” away? How do we know this old legend you're basing everything on isn't just idle talk?"
83,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_WESANPE_000_045","They do, sir. I'm sure of it. Three of the things had me cornered, till Kayamene showed up holding one of those stones. They were afraid, and not of her."
84,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_WESANPE_000_046","There's no doubt in my mind that if we can mine more of this stuff and scatter it around the ceruleum works, just like her ancestors did with the Maw, we can keep the whole operation safe."
85,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_TAWZENZA_000_047","If there's any operation left to <Emphasis>keep</Emphasis> safe. We're already in deep with the banks for the new rigs and the plant refit. Until production ramps up, where am I going to get the gil to open up a whole new dig site?"
86,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_ZITEKKWA_000_048","I believe that's where I come in."
87,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_TAWZENZA_000_049","I'm sorry, you are...?"

89,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_ZITEKKWA_000_051","Your colleagues told me of the difficulties they've been having with these blue blobs. While they've only been sighted around Sheshenewezi Springs thus far, I am of the firm belief that they could soon pose a threat to all Shaaloani."
90,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_ZITEKKWA_000_052","After all, if these creatures are attracted to the scent of burning ceruleum, it isn't only your wells that are in danger. The station, too, could soon find itself under attack."
91,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_ZITEKKWA_000_053","Indeed, I confirmed with one of my clients who works for the railroad that creatures fitting the description I gave him have been sighted along the tracks. So you see that I have a personal stake in this."
92,"TEXT_KINGZE401_05148_ZITEKKWA_000_054","I would be more than willing to lend you whatever funds you need to put your colleagues' plan into action─and on terms that don't interfere with the daily running of your company, naturally."

And with a little help from folk like you, I know that one day, we'll make this a place where people can not just survive, but thrive!"
