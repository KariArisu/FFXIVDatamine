※This quest is available for a limited time only."

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

66,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_BEAUDEFOIN_000_050","With those pesky cactuars back under control, it is time I livened things up around here. Would you be so kind as to relay the glad tidings to Haermaga?"
67,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_POBYANO_000_051","A refreshing breeze, a clear view of the cactuars... Yes, I think this area will do nicely."
68,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_MEMEJA_000_052","Hee hee! Oh, what a relief that my pets have returned. Isn't that right, Cactania?"
69,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_HAERMAGA_000_060","Welcome back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It seems you had the cactuar crisis well in hand. You've done your part to keep the peace, and for that, I thank you."

71,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_POBYANO_000_062","I just wanted to report that the pet cactuars are resting safely away from the main festivities. I asked another chaperone to keep an eye on them."

74,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_GEGERUJU_000_065","That being said, speaking as one who has seen his share of dancers, your pets have star potential, my dear Memeja."
75,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_MEMEJA_000_066","Truly!? Perhaps I should have them formally trained!"
76,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_POBYANO_000_069","You're not seriously going to <Emphasis>encourage</Emphasis> that behavior, are you!? Lest you forget, it was pure coincidence that we found a peaceable solution through the use of our uchiwa. Were something like this to happen again, that luck may not hold!"
77,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_MEMEJA_000_070","Surely you don't mean─I-I've learned my lesson, I swear it! As soon as we're home, I'll ensure they're trained to stay at my side at all times!"
78,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_POBYANO_000_071","That's all I ask. Incidentally, did you notice anything that might have served as the catalyst to their cavorting?"
79,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_MEMEJA_000_072","No, I'm afraid not. I was away at the time, you see."
80,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_GEGERUJU_000_073","I thought it quite strange myself. One moment they were downing their wine like sailors, and the next, it was as though they were possessed by some manner of wicked spirit!"
81,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_HAERMAGA_000_074","They were...drinking wine, milord?"
82,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_GEGERUJU_000_075","And what a fine vintage it was! I was delighted to be in like-minded company. Oh, the great conversation we could have had, if only they could speak..."
83,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_POBYANO_000_076","Memeja, I can't believe I'm asking this, but is wine safe for cactuars?"
84,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_MEMEJA_000_077","How should I know? I've only ever given them the finest spring water from the mountains of Coerthas, myself!"
85,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
86,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_A1_000_001","It seems we have our culprit."
87,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_A1_000_002","So they were just drunk?"
88,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_GEGERUJU_000_078","Pah! They barely had a cupful each. And besides, it's not like I poured the stuff down their throats, did I?"
89,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_GEGERUJU_000_079","Alright, look─perhaps sharing a bottle wasn't the best of ideas, but how was I to know they couldn't hold their drink!?"
90,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_HAERMAGA_000_080","Personally, I'm just glad the mystery's been put to rest. And seeing as Memeja's learned her lesson, I daresay we won't be seeing a repeat of this incident."
91,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_POBYANO_000_081","Well, just in case someone <Emphasis>else</Emphasis> gives wine to some <Emphasis>other</Emphasis> cactuars, I'll be sure to let the chaperone team know to reach for an uchiwa rather than a weapon."
92,"TEXT_FESSUX002_05183_HAERMAGA_000_082","That would be much appreciated, P'obyano. Now, let us return to the festival. The Adventurers' Guild won't promote itself, you know!"
