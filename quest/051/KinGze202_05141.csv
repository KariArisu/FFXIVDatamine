Zitekkwa has crossed one name off his list, but there are yet more clients to see."
1,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_SEQ_01","The next person on Zitekkwa's list is a young minstrel by the name of Zemeshpe. He disappeared in the dead of night, but word around town is that the minstrel was seen headed for the Xak Tural skygate.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_SEQ_02","Without new songs, Zemeshpe has been unable to make ends meet, nor has he earned enough money to repay Zitekkwa. Rather than insist on payment, Zitekkwa offers him gil to travel across Tuliyollal in search of musical inspiration."
3,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_SEQ_03","While Zitekkwa failed to receive payment from his client, he considers his decision an investment in the future. Satisfied, he is prepared to move on to his next client."

49,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_002","He ran off in the middle of the night, and I haven't seen hide nor hair of him since."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_003","Luckily for us, I heard from an acquaintance of mine that someone fitting his description was seen lurking around the Xak Tural skygate."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_004","We're looking for a minstrel named Zemeshpe. Hhetsarro with black hair, about the same age as me, and surprisingly shy. I'll meet you there!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_005","Zemeshpe has to be around here somewhere. It's only a matter of time before we find him."
53,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_CITIZENA05141_000_006","I wish I could help you, but I don't know any Zemeshpe."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_CITIZENB05141_000_007","You may have better luck looking around the other side of the trailhead."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_CITIZENA05141_000_010","Sorry, friend. I don't know anyone by that name. But before you go, you wouldn't happen to have any tuna, would you? I'm positively parched."
56,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_SYSTEM_000_011","Unfortunately, this isn't the man you're looking for. Perhaps someone else nearby can point you in the right direction."
57,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_CITIZENB05141_000_012","Zemeshpe? Sorry, the name doesn't ring any bells. That said, I think I saw a young Hhetsarro head over to the other side of the trailhead. Poor boy looked upset about something."
58,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_SYSTEM_000_013","This is not the man you're looking for, but you seem to be hot on their trail. Perhaps you'll have better luck searching the other side of the trailhead as he suggests."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZEMESHPE_000_014","Huh!? Wh-Who are you?"
60,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZEMESHPE_000_016","(-Zemeshpe-)Yes, I'm Zemeshpe, but... Wh-What do you want with me?"
61,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_017","You found him! Nice work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
62,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZEMESHPE_000_018","(-Zemeshpe-)Zitekkwa!? What are you doing here!?"
63,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_019","Looking for you. Word around town was you were in a hurry to leave to Yok Tural, but I'm afraid I can't let you leave just yet."
64,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_020","He may not look it, but Zemeshpe is quite the popular minstrel in Hhusatahwi. Or at least, he was. It's been what feels like an age since last he wrote a song, and you can only make so much singing the same old tune day in and day out."
65,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_021","Zemeshpe came to me for help, and I gladly offered him a loan. It should have been enough to help him get by until inspiration struck."
66,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZEMESHPE_000_022","(-Zemeshpe-)But it hasn't! And with no money to pay you back, I-I panicked! Maybe if I sold my instruments, I..."
67,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_023","Those instruments are your livelihood! I could never ask you to do such a thing!"
68,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_024","Here. Give me your hand."
69,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZEMESHPE_000_025","(-Zemeshpe-)This is...! B-But I've yet to return what I already owe!"
70,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_026","What you need is to meet new people, see new places─experience more of the world than just Hhusatahwi."
71,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_100_026","A minstrel's inspiration doesn't just come from thin air, right?"
72,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZEMESHPE_200_026","(-Zemeshpe-)You're not wrong. All I could think about was how my songs weren't good enough anymore, how everyone was disappointed in me. My heart was so full with fear and anxiety, I guess there was no room left for music."
73,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_027","So take that money and go to Yok Tural. And for the next month, I want you to travel. See everything there is to see. Find your muse, and bring back the Zemeshpe we all know and love."
74,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZEMESHPE_000_028","(-Zemeshpe-)...Thank you, Zitekkwa. I won't let this gil go to waste, I swear it! "
75,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_030","So, what do you think? A job well done, wouldn't you say?"
76,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
77,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_A1_000_000","Hmmm. I don't know..."
78,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_A1_000_001","Isn't it risky loaning to people who run off like that?"
79,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_A1_000_002","I'll admit that was quite generous of you."
80,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_031","I suppose this may not have been the best example. I failed to collect what I was owed, after all..."
81,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_032","What did you expect me to do? I'm not a monster. Besides, I see this as more of an investment for the future."
82,"TEXT_KINGZE202_05141_ZITEKKWA_000_033","There's still one last client left on my list. One more opportunity for you to learn about my work."
