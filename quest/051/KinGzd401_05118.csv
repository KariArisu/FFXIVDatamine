Something is troubling Gotoll Ja."
1,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_01","Gotoll Ja tells you that a strange, armed Xbr'aal man has been loitering near Mamook. Given the tense history between their peoples, your Mamool Ja friend hopes that your position as a neutral third party will be enough to safely treat with the suspicious stranger.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_02","The suspicious individual is, in fact, Ty'at Roh, who rejoices over finding a friendly face on this side of the woods. He is here on official hunter business, it would seem─seeking an answer to frenzied beasts in the upper forests. This dilemma tugs at a similar quandary you had not long ago, and at your prompting, Ty'at Roh expresses an eager interest in speaking with locals regarding recent beast trouble."
3,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_03","You return to Gotoll Ja with Ty'at Roh in tow, and after some startled introductions, the two begin to speak. Beasts native to the Ja Tiika Heartlands are running rampant on the Ut'ohmu Horizon, and once innocuous wivres have turned feral. Something is amiss in Yak T'el, and both Mamool Ja and Xbr'aal alike would discover what. Ty'at Roh innocently suggests asking around the city, but Gotoll Ja refuses to let a Xbr'aal go wandering off alone. You, however, have earned your reputation as friend and comrade to all Mamool Ja, so you head off to inquire about wildlife."
4,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_04","The citizens echo the unease you have felt yourself in regards to the surrounding wildlife. However, a man named Soneel Ja may be able to tell you more about something big lurking in the darkness..."
5,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_05","According to Soneel Ja's testimony, a gigantic tentacled monstrosity lurks somewhere near Bitterbark Cenote, and is capable of swallowing lesser beasts whole. <Switch(PlayerParameter(71))><Case(1)>You are suddenly deeply grateful that you are not a Lalafell.</Case><Case(2)>You are suddenly deeply grateful that you are not a Lalafell.</Case><Case(3)>Good luck.</Case><Case(4)>You are suddenly deeply grateful that you are not a Lalafell.</Case><Case(5)>You are suddenly deeply grateful that you are not a Lalafell.</Case><Case(6)>You are suddenly deeply grateful that you are not a Lalafell.</Case><Case(7)>You are suddenly deeply grateful that you are not a Lalafell.</Case><Case(8)>You are suddenly deeply grateful that you are not a Lalafell.</Case></Switch>"
6,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_06","After you relay your findings to Gotoll Ja, the pieces begin to fall into place. Whatever is lurking in Bitterbark Cenote must be causing the displacement and distress of Yak T'el's beastly denizens. Concocting a plan of action on the spot, Gotoll Ja bids you join him at the cenote in question."
7,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_07","Ty'at Roh reports no incident on the journey to Bitterbark Cenote, except for discovering the remains of what was presumably the tentacled monster's last meal. In testament to his years as a mercenary, Gotoll Ja becomes deeply pragmatic in the face of carnage and offers you a new weapon he crafted before your arrival: a stink bomb packed with pieces of what your quarry finds delicious."
8,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_08","You drop the smelly explosive, taking care not to splash any liquid onto your person. Now it is just a matter of time before the mysterious monster tormenting the forest arrives─and in the mood to feast."
9,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_09","Not one but two beasts appear, gaping maws dripping with digestive juices. But you have not crossed time, space, and reflections just to be eaten by some lowly forest worm. You make quick work of the beasts, and turn to find Ty'at Roh beaming at you."
10,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_10","Ty'at Roh is delighted to have witnessed you in action and suggests you all return to Mamook now that the deed is done. Even gruff Gotoll Ja has a smile twitching at the corner of his mouth."
11,"TEXT_KINGZD401_05118_SEQ_11","Thanks to an unlikely alliance, the menace has been vanquished and the forests rest easier. Gotoll Ja and Ty'at Roh exchange hopes that their peoples might openly work together someday, but acknowledge the difficulty of forcing an issue such as trust. Regardless, each vow to do what they can to change hearts and minds, and invite you back to visit whenever you'd like─and one day witness a Yak T'el united and stronger for it."
