Ty'at Roh would share the bounty of the forest with his village."
1,"TEXT_KINGZD202_05111_SEQ_01","While Ty'at Roh is eager to test his─and your─mettle in the hunters' trial, you must both return with your quarries. Ty'at Roh offers to cut the meat into manageable portions, and he asks you to distribute them around the village. He leaves to start his work, and bids you to find him when you are ready to commence yours.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZD202_05111_SEQ_02","Ty'at Roh has separated your catch into the proper parts and says that the best pelt and bone are meant for the village's weaponsmith, while the meat is meant for one Ty'at Ilyik. He will distribute the rest of the catch to others in the village, so that nothing goes to waste."
3,"TEXT_KINGZD202_05111_SEQ_03","You deliver the spoils of the hunt as directed. The villagers speak of how the Brethren of Br'aax have their hands full, though it remains to be seen what occupies their time. Ty'at Roh is doubtless awaiting your return to hear what the recipients of his gifts had to say."
4,"TEXT_KINGZD202_05111_SEQ_04","Ty'at Roh seems in high spirits, for he informs you that he ran into one of the Brethren of Br'aax during his delivery. The seasoned hunter accepted Ty'at Roh's petition to take the trial. With a new chapter of his life opening before him, the young Xbr'aal must steel his nerves for what is sure to be a trying test of his skills. "

55,"TEXT_KINGZD202_05111_TYATROH_000_015","You'd best deliver those parts before they spoil─I'd hate for a day's hunt to go to waste."
56,"TEXT_KINGZD202_05111_CRAFTSMAN05111_000_020","Aye, I'm the weaponsmith here. You say you have something from Ty'at Roh?"
57,"TEXT_KINGZD202_05111_CRAFTSMAN05111_000_021","Ah, these are excellent! See this needle-shaped bone? It supports the ty'aitya's webbed wings and can be carved into deadly spear tips. The pelt is surprisingly sturdy, as well."
58,"TEXT_KINGZD202_05111_CRAFTSMAN05111_000_022","The Brethren of Br'aax have been ordering more equipment lately, and supplies are running low. This will help us meet their needs for a while longer. Give Ty'at Roh my thanks, will you?"
