50,"TEXT_KINGZF104_05158_CINNABAR_000_002","These areas have a tendency to attract swarms of monsters. Normally we have a hunter clear them out, but given that they're shorthanded, I should like to hire you for the task instead."
51,"TEXT_KINGZF104_05158_CINNABAR_000_003","The most infested areas are in the northwest and the south. Oh, and a word of warning: try not to fall in. The tingle is most unpleasant."
52,"TEXT_KINGZF104_05158_CINNABAR_000_004","The infested craters can be found to the northwest and the south. Do try to slay any monsters you find before your weapon hand goes numb, yes?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZF104_05158_CINNABAR_000_005","You've cleared them all out, I take it? Fantastic work."
54,"TEXT_KINGZF104_05158_CINNABAR_000_006","See that there, beyond the western shore─the menacing purple glow of the upturned city? We have the Storm Surge to thank for that."
55,"TEXT_KINGZF104_05158_CINNABAR_000_007","They say a wartime weapon created that gargantuan fount of lightning. And where such energy gathers, so too do monsters, tenfold."
56,"TEXT_KINGZF104_05158_CINNABAR_000_008","Compared to something like that, these little chasms seem downright decorative. Still, the monsters are a hazard that cannot go unchecked. <sigh> Would that we had a more permanent solution."
