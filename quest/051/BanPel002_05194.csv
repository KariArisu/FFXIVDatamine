She asks you to join her in welcoming the weary traveler, and bids you wait by the entrance to the agency's base of operations while she finishes tending to business.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANPEL002_05194_SEQ_02","Having journeyed all the way from Tuliyollal, Tseeya, the aforementioned first customer, arrives astride a handsome alpaca, already enamored with Kozama'uka's lush beauty. Before leaving to deal with the necessary paperwork, Liplu requests you join her in Dock Poga when ready."
3,"TEXT_BANPEL002_05194_SEQ_03","Keen to ensure that naught goes wrong during Tseeya's visit, Liplu bids you keep an eye on the Hhetsarro and his guide, Zelihali. You dutifully head for Ok'hanu, where the tour begins."
4,"TEXT_BANPEL002_05194_SEQ_04","You stand watch as Zelihali recounts the role played by Wuk Lamat in the Lifting of Wings. A fascinated Tseeya gazes up at the woven festival float, struck by the significance of the Hanuhanu's prize crop. Cultural lesson complete, the pair make for Breath Between for the next activity on the agenda: a spot of fishing."
5,"TEXT_BANPEL002_05194_SEQ_05","With the ever-flowing waters of Ku'uxage in view, you look on as your charges bask in their surroundings and wait for the fish to bite. Before long, though, Tseeya asks his guide if she knows of any waters off the beaten track. Eager to oblige, Zelihali suggests they try Cave Kikitola, well known among local anglers for its abundance. Yet the more remote location may also prove more hazardous..."
6,"TEXT_BANPEL002_05194_SEQ_06","Sure enough, not long after your arrival, a pack of voracious orobon emerge from the gloom. You dispatch the foul beasts and continue to stand guard over the oblivious Tseeya and Zelihali."
7,"TEXT_BANPEL002_05194_SEQ_07","Thanks in no small part to your vigilance, the tour ends without incident─for your charges at least. You make your way back to Dock Poga, where Liplu awaits your return."

After raising his concerns regarding guest safety, Tseeya reveals that the Wing of Reflection is considering supporting Tural's nascent tourism industry. Buoyed by this expression of interest from the government itself, Liplu decides to invest in a facility for guides to train in the art of visitor protection. As the Turali Travel Agency continues to grow, there will be much and more required of you to ensure its continued success."

85,"TEXT_BANPEL002_05194_TSEEYA_000_042","Say, I don't suppose you know of any fishing spots off the beaten trail? There are a fair few anglers here besides us, and I haven't had a single bite yet..."
86,"TEXT_BANPEL002_05194_ZELIHALI_000_043","Perhaps Cave Kikitola would fit the bill. It's a modest walk away, but the fish are plentiful, and one may cast their line in peace and quiet."
