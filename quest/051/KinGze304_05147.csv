Kayamene has a stone in her hand and a cloud on her brow."
1,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_SEQ_01","Kayamene comes to the realization that by taking the strange, white crystals from the Maw of Sansheya, she has put all Shaaloani in danger. She races to return her stolen stone to the Maw, and bids you follow suit as soon as you are able.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_SEQ_02","You find Kayamene crouched over Wesanpe, who was conducting his own investigation into the Maw when he came under attack from a pack of blue blobs. Though the stone Kayamene was carrying has driven them to the hills, she begs that you give chase and lay them low, lest they should set upon any other unsuspecting soul."
3,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_SEQ_03","You find and dispatch the blue blobs with all haste. Your duty done, all that remains is to return to Sheshenewezi Springs to regroup with Kayamene."
4,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_SEQ_04","Back in Sheshenewezi Springs, Kayamene recounts Neshtezi's tale to Wesanpe: of the ancient threat of the blue blobs, and of the stones which ward them away from the burning ceruleum they so crave. You vow to journey to Yowekwa Canyon to find more of the same stones, that Shaaloani may be safe from the blue beast and its minions once more."

48,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_000","First things first, we need to get these crystals back to the Maw as quick as we can. Right now, there's nothing stopping the blobs from jumping into those pits and bringing back their master!"
49,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_001","Oh, I'm such a fool! Grammy always told me I'd have to be stupid to go anywhere near the Maw of Sansheya, and she was right!"
50,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_002","If anyone gets hurt, it'll be all my fault! We have to hurry!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_WESANPE_000_007","Ugh... No sightings round the Maw, I said. Shows what I know..."
52,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_004","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! We came back just in time. I found Wesanpe being attacked by three of those things, but they ran off as soon as I arrived. Must have been the stone in my pocket."
53,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_005","They're getting bolder, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. We need to do away with them before they can hurt anyone else. You go after them─I'll get Wesanpe back to the Springs."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_006","The blobs that were attacking Wesanpe can't have gone far. You need to finish them off before they find someone else to take their anger out on!"
55,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_010","You got them? Oh, thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
56,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_WESANPE_000_011","Yes, thank you. Both of you. You saved my life."
57,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_WESANPE_000_012","I was done with Kayamene's deliveries, so I thought I'd take a look around the Maw myself. See if I could find what was keeping the blue blobs away. Turned out the answer was “nothing.”"
58,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_WESANPE_000_013","I fought them off as best I could, but it was three against one. If it weren't for you, I'd be a dead man."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_014","You're wrong. The only reason they attacked you is <Emphasis>because</Emphasis> of us! Because of <Emphasis>me</Emphasis>!"
60,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_WESANPE_000_016","...So that's how it is. Old stones, and old magic."
61,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_017","Yes. The stones were the only thing keeping them from the pits. I'm sorry..."
62,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_WESANPE_000_018","You weren't to know. But now we do, the question is: what are we going to do about it? We know that the blobs are attracted to burning ceruleum, and we know they're dangerous..."
63,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_WESANPE_000_019","But we also know that they won't go anywhere near the kind of stones you and <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> found in the pits. That, to me, adds up to a plan─providing we can get our hands on more of them."
64,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_020","Grammy said the stones were mined from Yowekwa Canyon. If there are any more in there, we can dig them out and place them around town as a barrier to the blobs!"
65,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_WESANPE_000_022","Alright. You head down to the canyon and see what you can find. I'll keep covering your deliveries till you get back. Luck be with you."
66,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_023","Next stop, the canyon! If we can find a seam of this stuff, we can finally keep our people safe. ...Speaking of, I hope you don't mind coming with me again. I'm a tapper not a fighter, and there's a lot of open desert between here and there."
67,"TEXT_KINGZE304_05147_KAYAMENE_000_024","Not to mention that you're our resident expert at finding these stones. I didn't know one even when it hit me in the toe! I'll go and get my headlamp─come and see me when you're ready to head out!"
