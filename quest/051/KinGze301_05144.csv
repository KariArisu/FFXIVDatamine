Wesanpe of Sheshenewezi Springs is short one porter."
1,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_SEQ_01","One of Wesanpe's fellow ceruleum tappers has failed to return from a trip to the Tuliyollal Trailhead, though her rroneek and wagon appear to have managed the journey. He asks you to seek out any sign of the missing Kayamene.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_SEQ_02","You come across Kayamene on the road to Tuliyollal. She had been set upon by one of the strange, blue blob creatures that have lately been sighted around the wells. She asks for your help in impressing the danger these creatures pose on her recalcitrant company, and asks that you meet with her in Sheshenewezi Springs for precisely that purpose."
3,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_SEQ_03","You arrive back in Sheshenewezi Springs safe and sound, but there is no time to rest on your laurels. Something must be done about the threat of the mysterious blue blobs, and Kayamene hopes your expert testimony will encourage the foremen to take action."

48,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_WESANPE_000_000","Hey, you. Traveler. You came here down the Tuliyollal trail, right? Happen to see a woman on the road? Maybe nursing a limp, a sore head, or some such?"
49,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_WESANPE_000_001","...No sign, huh. I work here at the refinery, and it seems I now have a problem."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_WESANPE_000_002","It's a friend of mine. Kayamene. She set out for Tuliyollal not long back, but only her rroneek returned, pulling an empty wagon."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_WESANPE_000_003","Was thinking the animal just got spooked by something. Sent Kayamene sprawling in the dust and hightailed it back here. But if you didn't see her... Say, you couldn't go and take another look, could you? I'd go myself, but I'm two hands down as it is."
52,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_WESANPE_000_004","Thanks, friend. She was taking a cargo of ceruleum to the Tuliyollal Trailhead. You know the way, right?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_WESANPE_000_005","Just take the road southeast from town. She'll be somewhere along it. If you find her, tell her to get her hide back here as quick as she can. We've got work to do!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_010","Ah, finally! You don't know how good it is to see a friendly face."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_011","...Wesanpe sent you? Gods, he's going to dock my pay, isn't he? Well, at least the rroneek and the wagon made it back."
56,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_012","A good thing it all happened after I'd dropped off the ceruleum, too. Don't want to think how much the company would charge me if I lost the load. Maybe that's what the beast was after... "
57,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_013","Oh, I didn't tell you about the beast, did I? I was just out from the trailhead when it sprang up on us out of nowhere. Naturally, my rroneek bolted."
58,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_100_014","Managed to hold on this far, but I eventually lost my grip and took a dirt bath. Still, it could have been worse─at least I didn't break anything, and it was you that found me, not the beast."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_100_015","Speaking of, you didn't see it on your way down, did you? A horrible, blue, blobby thing..."
60,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_022","...Just like that! Oh, gods! It's the beast! It's found me!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_100_022","Um...it was a lot more aggressive down by the trailhead, I swear. Why isn't it attacking?"
62,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_023","Huh... I guess it took one look at you and lost its appetite."
63,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_024","Thanks, partner. I've lived here my whole life and never seen anything like that blue blob before."
64,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_025","But others have. I heard about them from my fellow tappers. Like ceruleum with skin, they said. Started showing their ugly faces a few years back, prowling around by the wells."
65,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_026","They reported it to the foremen, but they weren't interested. The way they consider it, so long as we've still got all our limbs attached, the blobs aren't a threat."
66,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_027","But they damn well better change their minds about them now! If it's not enough that one of their best employees could have been killed, they could have lost a wagonload of ceruleum!"
67,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_028","Say, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, would you come back to the company offices with me? They can't wave it away so easily if the both of us are telling the same story."
68,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_029","Thank you kindly! Come on, then, let's head on back to Sheshenewezi Springs!"
69,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_030","Home at last! For a moment there, I didn't think I'd ever see the old place again."
70,"TEXT_KINGZE301_05144_KAYAMENE_000_031","And I can tell you right now, I'm not taking another wagon out until the company tells me exactly what they're going to do to protect their precious employees from those rotten blobs! Are you with me?"
