After keeping merchants waiting to pass through, Hhopu now finds himself doing the waiting."

49,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_000_002","Say, you wouldn't happen to be on your way to Hhusatahwi, would you? I've been charged with overseeing inspection of goods passing through to Tuliyollal, and according to our list, we have two merchants who have yet to claim their wares. "
50,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_000_003","Considering the present state of Tuliyollal, not to mention the sheer volume of goods they meant to transport, we offered them numbered vouchers and directed the pair to a saloon in Hhusatahwi to wait while we carry out inspection."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_100_003","Due to the sheer volume, we offered them numbered vouchers that they might wait elsewhere while we look over their goods. I directed the pair to the saloon in Hhusatahwi, but they've yet to return."
52,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_000_004","I would be most grateful if you could speak with the saloonkeeper, Nikawtenhe, and find these merchants."
53,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_000_005","Nikawtenhe is certain to know where they are. When you find them, please tell them to come collect their wares."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_NIKAWTENHE_000_010","Merchants waiting for inspection? Ah! Yes, I know who you mean."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_NIKAWTENHE_000_011","One is a younger Hhetsarro fellow with long red hair. You'll find him upstairs, hopefully not too deep in his cups."
56,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_NIKAWTENHE_000_012","The other is a Xbr'aal gentleman in green. Said something about seeking inspiration and went out back."
57,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_NIKAWTENHE_000_013","The two you're looking for came in together, but they're not drinking together. The Hhetsarro fellow you'll find upstairs. The Xbr'aal gentleman is out back."

59,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_CITIZENB05124_000_0021","Inspection! I guess I overdid it with the food and mezcal."
60,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_CITIZENB05124_000_0022","That was awful kind of them sending you here, though. I'm suddenly glad I paid the toll in advance. Well, I had better be off!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_CITIZENC05124_000_0025","Can I help you with something?"
62,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_CITIZENC05124_000_0026","Oh, is it time already? I was distracted by these crops. I trade mostly in nopalitender, you see, but I've been considering how best to expand my selection of wares."
63,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_CITIZENC05124_000_0027","You're not like to make profit off aught else tilling such arid soil. Or so I thought. These crops caught my eye and I had to come take a closer look."
64,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_CITIZENC05124_000_0028","It seems I've yet more to learn about farming here in the wilds. Next time I'm in town, I'll need to have a word with whoever planted these. But for now, I should be heading back to the checkpoint."
65,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_000_030","The merchants passed through to Tuliyollal not long ago."
66,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_000_031","Of course, it'll be a while yet before they reach the other side of Zorgor the Boundless. It was originally built by the Yok Huy, you know─the sole bridge connecting Xak Tural and Yok Tural."
67,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_000_032","Travelers such as yourself are free to cross as you please, so long as you carry a permit. It's when they mean to cross encumbered with wagons upon wagons of goods and supplies that things become complicated. Too many at once and soon no one is able to cross at all."
68,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_000_033","Our present solution is to impose a tax commensurate with the size of their cargo. And because of the time required to inspect said cargo, we occasionally send them to Hhusatahwi to wait."
69,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_000_034","Given the present state of Tuliyollal after the attack, I'm afraid they've been made to wait far longer than usual. Sending travelers such as yourself to call them back here is the least we can do for putting them through this hassle. Speaking of which, here─for your troubles."
70,"TEXT_KINGZE006_05124_HHOPU_100_034","It comes at the cost of occasionally hiring help to call them back here, but it's the least we can do for putting them through this hassle. Speaking of which, here─for your troubles."
