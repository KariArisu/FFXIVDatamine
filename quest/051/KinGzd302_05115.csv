Shiidil Ja seems to know where to start regarding the wivres."
1,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SEQ_01","Shiidil Ja wishes to search the area where they were attacked for clues regarding the wivres' aggression. While she knows the land better than you do, you are more practiced at fending off grumpy beasts, so you agree to rid the roads of potential threats on your way to the cenote past Golmajiik Grove.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SEQ_02","You dutifully clear the roads of wivres to allow Shiidil Ja safe passage to Golmajiik Grove. As you wait for her arrival, you can't help noticing the giant, magnificent stone that stands nearby..."
3,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SEQ_03","Unfortunately, Shiidil Ja finds nothing that might explain the wivre attack─but you find a precious memento she dropped during her escape. The cyan crystal glimmers in her hand as she speaks of the past and the man her husband once was. Gotoll Ja's injury was debilitating not only to his body but his mind, and now he seemingly struggles to find new purpose. Shaking herself from her reverie, Shiidil Ja suggests you return to Mamook for now."
4,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SEQ_04","While you were away, Gotoll Ja asked around the city. Apparently he has discovered information of note regarding the wivres, and Shiidil Ja seems eager to hear what he has to say..."

49,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_010","First, I think we ought to search the area where we were attacked."
50,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_011","If anything's amiss, I should be able to spot it. But I worry about another ambush..."
51,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_012","Would you go ahead and make sure the roads are safe?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_013","Thank you, stranger. You are ever generous."
53,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_014","We first encountered the wivres north of Golmajiik Grove, by the cenote there. I'll give you an ample head start and then come and meet you."
54,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_GOTOLLJA_000_015","In the meantime, I'll ask around the city. Others may have been similarly attacked, for all we know."
55,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_020","We need to investigate the cenote just north of Golmajiik Grove. I'll come and meet you once you've cleared a safe path."
56,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_GOTOLLJA_000_021","While you and Shiidil Ja are away, I'll ask around the city. Maybe someone knows something about the wivres."
57,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SYSTEM_100_021","You scan the area, but no wivres emerge."
58,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_030","Thank you for doing that. I had no troubles at all on my way here."
59,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_031","Hmm... Something that might explain the wivres' aggression..."
60,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_100_031","I'm afraid I don't see anything unusual. What do you think?"
61,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_032","What is it?"
62,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_033","My cyan crystal! I must have dropped it when we were attacked..."
63,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_034","It was a gift from my husband, when he returned from Eorzea. He said its blue glow reminded him of these forests, so he carried it always."
64,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_035","Worth no more than a common stone, I'd wager, but to me it is precious. It kept him safe while he was away. Brought him home alive."
65,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_037","Sometimes, the grief of his injury blinds him to the miracle of his survival. He may not be able to fight anymore, but he is still the strongest man I know."
66,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_039","My husband used to train here in his youth. We call this stone Choliselvaas─“the weight of the sky.” And once, he believed with all his heart that he could bear any weight. Achieve any dream."
67,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_040","I wanted to remind him of that when I brought him here. But then those wivres came along..."
68,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_042","Anyway, I've chattered on long enough. So far as I can see, nothing in this area readily explains why those poor beasts attacked us as they did. Perhaps Gotoll Ja has discovered something back in the city."
69,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_GOTOLLJA_000_050","Back without incident? Good."
70,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_SHIIDILJA_000_060","Well, it was by no means a waste of a journey. I was able to recover my precious crystal!"
71,"TEXT_KINGZD302_05115_GOTOLLJA_000_061","Thank you for seeing her home safely. While you were away, I managed to glean a thing or two about our wivres."
