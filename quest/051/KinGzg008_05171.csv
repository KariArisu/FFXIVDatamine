48,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_000","Would you mind giving me a hand? I'm trying to find my ring. I think I must've lost it trying to escape during the attack."
49,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_001","It's a plain band set with a black stone. Nothing fancy, but it's important to me─we've had it in our family for generations."
50,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_002","Before the raid, I was doing some shopping in the Nexus Arcade, so I figure it's around here someplace. Thing is, there's too much ground to cover alone..."
51,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_003","Could I trouble you to search north of the arcade? You'd be doing me a huge favor. I'll keep looking around here. Let me know if you find anything."
52,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_005","Do me a favor and search the north side of the arcade, okay? I'd really appreciate it."
53,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_010","No luck here, I'm afraid. Did you fare any better?"
54,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_011","Oh, this is it, no mistake! Thank you so much!"
55,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_012","I guess I should tell you a little more about the ring after you went to all that trouble. Hundreds of years ago there was a terrible war we know as the Storm Surge. One of my ancestors─a scientist─had it made as an engagement ring."
56,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_013","The little black stone? That's raw electrope ore. Apparently, they snuck a small chunk out of the laboratory they were working at to use for the ring."
57,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_014","Back then, electrope ore was worth a small fortune. A gesture like that would've been a surefire way to anyone's heart─well, according to my mother at least."
58,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_015","Of course, these days electrope is more readily attainable, and without any circuits printed on it, a gem like this is nothing more than a bit of lightning-aspected rock."
59,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_016","Still, every time I look at it, I can't help but wonder about my ancestors and the lives they led. I suppose I'll never find out whether the ring was enough to send sparks flying, or if they were wed when all was said and done."
60,"TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_017","Thanks again for your help. I'll try and be more careful next time I'm fleeing murderous mechanical soldiers..."
