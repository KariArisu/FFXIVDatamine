Ty'at Roh needs to focus before his trial."
1,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_SEQ_01","With the decisive moment approaching, Ty'at Roh decides to shake off his growing nervousness by taking in the view from Nightstalker's Shadow. As his partner in the upcoming trial, it only seems proper to join him.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_SEQ_02","You arrive to see Ty'at Roh peering over the cliffs into the forest below, and he appears calmer already. He suggests you do the same and take in the view of the canopies."
3,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_SEQ_03","As you gaze upon the endless stretch of forest below you, Ty'at Roh tells you the history of the Brethren of Br'aax, who first existed as a band of warriors during the war between the Mamool Ja and Xbr'aal. The aspiring hunter then tells you his dream of bringing both peoples together in fellowship, that they might protect their homes as a collective. However, first he must be accepted into the hunters' brotherhood, and to do that he must pass the trial. It is to be held at the Xobr'it Cinderfield, and Ty'at Roh asks you to accompany him there to meet the arbiters of the competition─and your opponents."
4,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_SEQ_04","You arrive at the appointed place, but the other hunters are nowhere to be seen. With no choice but to wait for their arrival, you take in your blasted surroundings, and Ty'at Roh suppresses the anxiety churning in his gut."

51,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_A1_000_002","Maybe you should try distracting yourself."
52,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_001","You're right, you're right! I need to clear my head─why don't you come with me? I've always found taking in the view at Nightstalker's Shadow puts my mind at ease."
53,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_010","...I almost forgot how calming this place is. Coming here was the right decision."

56,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_020","It's trees as far as the eye can see. Under their branches live the Mamool Ja, who we fought against for so long."
57,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_021","The Brethren of Br'aax were formed during that conflict, and the very whisper of their presence struck fear into the hearts of our enemies. They would be sent off into battle with rousing words..."
58,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_022","“Fearless warriors, go forth into your domain! The forest bows to your might, equaled only by the wild br'aax! The forest falls silent at your footfalls, for the predators are come!”"
59,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_023","After the Dawnservant brokered peace between our peoples, the name was taken up by a group of our most seasoned hunters. Their duty was no longer to fight, but to protect the forest and serve its people."
60,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_024","...But the br'aax is king of the entire forest. Those who claim its name should do more to honor it."
61,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_025","Yak T'el doesn't end at these cliffs, as you can see. But even so, the brethren don't watch over the Ja Tiika Heartland."
62,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_026","Even though the war is over, Iq Br'aax and Mamook stand apart in tense silence. So tense that our hunters dare not set foot into the paths below."
63,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_027","But I think we can do better. We all live under the same boughs, after all. Why shouldn't we hunt together? Why shouldn't we work hand in hand to keep our home safe?"

68,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_030","Thank you. It might still be just a dream, but I mean to see it realized."
69,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_035","...Haha, you've got me there! To make this dream come true, I have to first be in a position to reach for it."
70,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_040","Truth be told, I know it won't be easy as things are. But that just makes me want to try harder to make this dream come true."

75,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_060","We'll be facing another pair of hunters. The brethren have taken the time to arrange this despite how busy they are, so I hope that means they see something in me."
76,"TEXT_KINGZD203_05112_TYATROH_000_061","I don't see them anywhere, though. I guess there's nothing for it but to wait here... Uh oh, the butterflies in my stomach are back!"
