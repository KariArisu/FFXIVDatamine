52,"TEXT_KINGZE013_05131_BROTHER05131_000_020","Thank you... If you hadn't turned up when you did, I'd be a goner for sure!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZE013_05131_BROTHER05131_000_021","I'd better go let my sister know I'm all right. Besides, it ain't safe here, so I suggest you head back to town as well. Maybe I'll see you there?"

56,"TEXT_KINGZE013_05131_BROTHER05131_000_031","Truth be told, a yeheheceyaa is the last thing I expected to see, never mind being attacked by one. They must've expanded their territory or something, so I'd better stay away from the cliff tops for a while."
57,"TEXT_KINGZE013_05131_BROTHER05131_000_032","That said, we make our living off the creatures we catch there, so we can't give up on cloudfishing altogether. I suppose the nearest safe spot would be somewhere near the bridge to Tuliyollal, which is kind of far from here... Still, better than no fishing at all!"
58,"TEXT_KINGZE013_05131_BROTHER05131_000_033","Speaking of which, it's time to go snag us some more fish! Thanks again, friend. Stay safe out there, you hear?"
