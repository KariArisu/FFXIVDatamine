Kayamene is eager to impress the danger posed by the “blue blobs” upon company management."
1,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_SEQ_01","Kayamene asks that you join her at the company's offices in Sheshenewezi Springs, that you might corroborate her testimony regarding your encounter with the blue blob to her foreman, Wesanpe.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_SEQ_02","Wesanpe is unwilling to raise the matter to the company's penny-pinching overseer until it can be proved beyond doubt that the blue blobs are attracted to ceruleum. To this end, he asks you to return to the Maw of Sansheya and search for clues as to why they seemingly shun the area."
3,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_SEQ_03","You and Kayamene split up to investigate the pits─while she searches the one north of the Tuliyollal trail, she asks that you search the one south of it."
4,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_SEQ_04","You find a strange, white crystal immersed in the ceruleum shallows. Though it appears to have been placed in the pool deliberately, who placed them there and for what purpose, remains unknown. Perhaps Kayamene might know?"
5,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_SEQ_05","Kayamene fished a similar crystal from her pool, but is similarly stumped as to its identity. Your investigation continues..."

48,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_000","Alright, so here's the plan: we go to my foreman, Wesanpe, the one who sent you to look for me. We tell him everything we know about the blue blob: how it ambushed my wagon and tried its darnedest to get me in its gullet."
49,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_001","And how the mere sight of a formidable warrior like you sent it running for the hills! Wesanpe's got the ear of the overseer, you see─so long as we can convince him, the company's sure to do something. Assign us an escort, at least..."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_002","I'll head over to the offices and drag Wesanpe from his desk. Come and join us as soon as you can!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_003","Go on, tell him what you saw! The sheer, gelatinous horror of it!"
52,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_005","Ah, traveler. Thanks for finding Kayamene and bringing her back safe. She said you and her had something you wanted to talk to me about?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_006","That's right! I was on my way back from the Tuliyollal Trailhead when I was set upon by a thrice-damned demon! If it hadn't been for <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here, I'd be drowning in that devilish jelly's belly right now!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_007","...And you say <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> saw this “blue blob” too?"
55,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_008","<If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> did! And <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If>'s not the only one. Plenty of the other tappers have seen them too, prowling around by the wells and the wagons. Even some of the engineers servicing the rigs."
56,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_009","You see the connection, don't you? They're nosing around anything─and anyone─that smells of ceruleum. Maybe they're attracted to it. Maybe that's why they were attracted to <Emphasis>me</Emphasis>!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_010","Maybe. If they are, and they're aggressive like you say, then they're a threat to our workers we can't ignore. Still, there's something about all this that doesn't hold water."
58,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_011","I've heard of these things too. The blue blobs. Been keeping track of the sightings. Even made a map of them."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_012","And d'you know what I found? Most of the sightings have been around Shaaloani Station. Not a single one near the Maw of Sansheya."
60,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_013","You know the Maw, right? The pits of ceruleum near the rigs. The ones that are always catching light."
61,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_100_014","It's the sunlight that sets them off, you know. They burn themselves out occasionally, but the next clear day that comes around, they're all aflame again."
62,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_014","What I'm saying is, that whole place stinks of ceruleum. So how come there's never been a sighting there, even with all the wagons taking the trail straight through it? And how come the one that followed you there took off as soon as it drew near?"
63,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
64,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_A2_000_000","Maybe there's something about the Maw that wards them away."
65,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_A2_000_001","Who knows what an animal like that is thinking?"
66,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_A2_000_002","It took one look at me and knew it had met its match!"
67,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_015","That's what I was thinking. Thought it might be the fire, but they don't seem to mind it around the rigs. No, there's got to be something else..."
68,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_016","True enough. But every creature has some reason to do what they do, even if they're only acting on instinct. And the instinct of these blue blobs seems to be to give the Maw a wide berth..."
69,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_017","Well, sure. I guess confidence is a virtue. But what about all the times you weren't around? No, there's something else going on, I'm sure of it..."
70,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_018","Kayamene, I want you to look into this. Go back to the Maw and see if you can figure out what might be keeping them away."
71,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_019","You grew up around those parts, right? Perhaps the folk in your old stomping grounds might know something we don't─and be more inclined to share it with one of their own than with an outsider. I'll handle all your portering duties till you get back."
72,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_020","You know what the overseer's like. Keeps his purse strings tight. Unless we can prove these things really are attracted to ceruleum, and the attack on you wasn't just a freak coincidence, he's never going to stump up the gil to guard every convoy."
73,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_021","Understood! I'll get you all the proof you need, I promise!"
74,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_000_022","Would you mind going with her? Don't worry, I'm not my boss─I can spare you an escort fee. The blobs might not like the Maw very much, but they seem to have taken a liking to her."
75,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_WESANPE_100_022","Thank you kindly. And take care out there."
76,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_023","Come on, then, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Back to the Maw!"
77,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_024","D'you know, I think this is the closest I've ever been to one of these pits. My grammy always told me never to go near the Maw. She said that if I burned myself to a crisp, I'd only have myself to blame..."
78,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_025","But duty calls! I'll have a look around this pit, you take the one across the way─it's just under the rig. As for what we're looking for, well...I suppose we'll know it when we find it!"
79,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_026","Don't worry about me. If I catch alight or see another one of those blue blobs, I'll scream─you can be sure of that. Go and see if you can find anything in that pit across the way."
80,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_SYSTEM_000_027","You find a pale, softly glowing crystal at the bottom of the ceruleum pool. Return to Kayamene to share your find."
81,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_030","...A crystal, you say? At the bottom of the pool?"
82,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_031","I found one too! Stubbed my toe on the wretched thing. Guess my grammy was right─jumping in the Maw <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> dangerous!"
83,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_032","I thought it was just a rock, albeit a funny colored one. Don't think I've ever seen a stone as white as this before. Not around these parts, anyway. And certainly not <Emphasis>two</Emphasis> of them..."
84,"TEXT_KINGZE302_05145_KAYAMENE_000_033","It's almost as if they've been put here deliberately. Here, you don't think these crystals might be what's keeping the blue blobs away, do you?"
