Nakente is fretting over her young charge, as she is wont to do."
1,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SEQ_01","Nakente has asked you to look for Shaloaci, the young Shetona in charge of Yyupye's Halo. She was last seen walking alone up the hill to the east of the farm, and Nakente fears she may be in danger.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SEQ_02","Thanks to you, Shaloaci has escaped a narrow brush with death. She will need further assistance if she is to get back on her feet, however."
3,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SEQ_03","The young Shetona is grateful for your help, but there is another she will need to thank: Nakente, the woman who sent you to find her. As you were planning to report back regardless, the two of you may return to the outskirts together."
4,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SEQ_04","After a thorough scolding from her aunty, Shaloaci explains the motive behind her recklessness: the yields at Yyupye's Halo have been dwindling steadily over the years, and the cause is unclear. Seeking an outsider's perspective, the two women have henceforth requested your cooperation in getting to the bottom of this mystery."

49,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_001","Well, if it isn't Her Majesty's guest! Did you enjoy your tour of Yyupye's Halo? I was told you even helped set the water distribution system to rights!"
50,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_002","You know, I could really use someone with your talents right about now. The woman in charge of that very farm just left for the wilderness without a bodyguard!"
51,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_003","Seems to me she's investigating something, but that's no reason to put herself in danger! Last I heard, she was seen walking up the hill to the east of the farm. Could you go and make sure she's all right?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_004","Oh, what a relief! You're looking for a young Shetona by the name of Shaloaci. Now, off you go─and thank you, dear!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_005","Shaloaci was last seen walking up the hill to the east of the farm. I don't care what the problem is─it's no excuse to be throwing caution to the wind!"
54,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_010","Agh... Gods be good, that was the last of my soul cells. I could have really died there..."
55,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_011","Thanks for your help, by the way. So, um, what brings you out here to the middle of nowhere?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_012","Aunty Nakente sent you after me!? That makes two people who just saved my life, then!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_013","Would you mind coming with me to see her? I want her to know I'm safe, and grateful besides."
58,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_014","But I─okay, okay! I'm sorry!"
59,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_020","Welcome back, dear. I can't thank you enough for rescuing this poor, reckless fool of a girl."
60,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_021","You're not a child anymore, Shalo! Act your age! Now, what do you say to the kind stranger who saved your life?"
61,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_022","I know I've already told you once before, but thank you, truly. I'm Shaloaci, and I'm in charge of Yyupye's Halo."
62,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_023","To tell the truth, I'm still learning how everything works. I used to be an electrope engineer, but for some reason the government reassigned me."
63,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_024","And I'm Nakente, the farm's coinkeeper. Or resident nag, depending on who you ask. Might we get your name, hero?"
64,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_025","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it?"
65,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_026","That's a name you'd best not forget, Shalo. You'd be dead were it not for <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>."
66,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_027","Now, why in the world would you leave the safety of the outskirts all by yourself? You've been acting so strangely of late─it's clear you're hiding something, so what is it?"
67,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_028","There really is no getting anything past you, is there? Fine, I'll explain, but you have to promise to keep it a secret for now, all right?"
68,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_029","The truth is...I noticed that the farm's harvests have been shrinking, year over year, and I can't for the life of me figure out why."
69,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_030","The staff are all doing great work, and as a former engineer, I can say for certain that the equipment is all in proper working order. I even checked the pylons, and the readout was totally normal."
70,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_031","But I know there's a problem, and the longer we wait, the worse it will get! In a few years, the crops may stop growing entirely! Something has to be done!"
71,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_032","Well, it sounds serious, and I appreciate that you're taking the initiative to solve it. But I worry about you, Shalo. I can't have you putting your life in danger!"
72,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_033","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, would you be willing to help her look into the matter?"
73,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_034","As an outsider, your idea of normal is sure to be different from ours. I reckon a fresh set of eyes will be able to spot something we can't."
74,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_SHALOACI_000_035","She's right─I could certainly use an unbiased perspective. Would you please help me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
75,"TEXT_KINGZF201_05160_NAKENTE_000_036","Right, then! With that settled, I think what you <If(PlayerParameter(4))>ladies<Else/>two</If> need now is a good meal. Have a seat and your aunty Nakente will fix you some fresh veggies!"
