Shaloaci is ready to dig into the mystery."
1,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SEQ_01","After a hearty meal, Shaloaci has invited you to Yyupye's Halo to get a closer look at the place─but first, Nakente would like to have a word with you in private.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SEQ_02","Nakente explains to you her concerns for what unspoken anxieties Shaloaci may be struggling with. As an outsider, you are perhaps uniquely equipped to lend an ear, and so she asks that you try to broach the subject at some point during your investigation. With that agreed upon, she sends you on your way to Yyupye's Halo."
3,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SEQ_03","You rendezvous with Shaloaci just outside the farm. After asking for your honest impression, she decides that perhaps the issue lies in the ground beneath your feet. While she examines the fields to the east, you are to investigate those in the west and report back should you find anything amiss."
4,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SEQ_04","You inform Shaloaci of a strange crackling sound coming from underground, and the two of you set to digging. What you unearth is stranger still: a measurement device as well as a box containing a report from Yyupye, the founder of the farm─addressed to none other than Shaloaci herself! While she reads the rest of the report, your task is to go and inform Nakente of your new lead."
5,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SEQ_05","You apprise Nakente of the latest developments, but she admits she has no recollection of Yyupye, suggesting the founder is no longer among the living. In any case, the investigation will surely continue once Shaloaci has finished reading the report in its entirety."

49,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_001","All right, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, time to get started! Er, well, I suppose I've already <Emphasis>started</Emphasis>, but...you know what I mean!"
50,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_002","First things first─we should have you take a look at the fields and see if you can spot anything that strikes you as unusual."
51,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_003","You go ahead and make ready, Shalo. As coinkeeper, it would be remiss to overlook the matter of <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s payment before <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> leaves. I'll send <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> along shortly."
52,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_004","Okay, then! Meet me by the bridge just outside of town when you're ready!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_010","Forgive me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but I wasn't entirely honest just now. You will of course be paid for your services, but there's something else I wanted to discuss."
54,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_011","I have a personal favor to ask of you. It concerns Shalo."
55,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_012","She was born after the land's fusion, you see. And her parents, well...none of us can remember them."
56,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_013","The townsfolk have all done their best to look after her, but I suspect she may struggle with things she doesn't feel she can talk to us about. Her reassignment by the government, for instance."
57,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_014","For an outsider like you, however, I suspect she may be willing to open up. Perhaps you could find a quiet moment during your investigation to talk to her?"
58,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_015","Thank you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Your help is much appreciated─on both counts, of course. Now run along, and don't forget: you're to meet up with her at the southern bridge!"
59,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_016","She said she'd meet you at the southern bridge. I hope you can help her..."
60,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_020","There you are! Aunty really talked your ear off, didn't she? Well, I'll spare you my idle chitchat."
61,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_021","You walked these fields with Her Majesty, right? What was your first impression?"
62,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_022","Be honest and don't hold back─any little critique might help!"
63,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_Q1_000_001","What will you say?"
64,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_A1_000_001","First impression? It's so <Emphasis>dreary</Emphasis>."
65,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_A1_000_002","The location seems less than ideal."
66,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_A1_000_003","How does anyone run a farm in this weather?"
67,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_023","Oh! I didn't realize that was an issue."
68,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_100_023","But now that I think on it, this place used to get a lot more sunlight in the past. That's why it's called Yyasulani, after all. “Where the clouds dry,” in the Shetona tongue."
69,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_024","It's only thanks to electrope technology that the farm has survived this long─specifically those pillars at the center of each field. "
70,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_025","They're a true godssend, converting lightning energy into not just water, but also fire to stave off the cold and earth to replenish the soil. They were the first thing I thought to check, but they're perfectly functional."
71,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_026","Still, you have a point: this isn't exactly prime farmland. Maybe there's an underlying problem with the soil that can't be mitigated with our tech."
72,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_027","In that case, I say we roll up our sleeves and examine the fields more closely. I'll take the east side, so the west is all yours! Sound good?"
73,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_028","Great! If you spot anything out of the ordinary, just give a shout. Likewise, if I find anything, you'll be sure to hear me. Now, let's get to it!"
74,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_029","The corn looks healthy. So do the popotoes. Hmmm, so perhaps it's not the soil."
75,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_100_030","I trust my dear Shalo is in good hands, yes?"
76,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SYSTEM_000_030","The soil is well drained with just the right amount of moisture─an effect of the electrope pillar, perhaps. In any case, nothing appears to be wrong."
77,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SYSTEM_000_031","The soil is faintly warm to the touch. Evidently this electrope pillar is doing its job."
78,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SYSTEM_000_032","If you listen carefully, you can make out a muffled crackling sound from underground. Shaloaci will want to hear about this."
79,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SYSTEM_000_033","The soil is nice and crumbly, owing not just to the electrope pillar but the dedicated maintenance of the farmhands here. There are no glaring issues that you can spot."
80,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SYSTEM_000_034","Now that you've investigated all the fields to the west, you should apprise Shaloaci of the strange crackling sound you heard earlier."
81,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_035","This is the field where you heard the funny sound?"
82,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_036","Well, I'll be─there it is! It sounds to me as though it's coming from deep underground. I'm impressed you caught it with those little ears of yours!"
83,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_037","Well, I'll be─there it is! It sounds to me as though it's coming from deep underground. Perhaps our long ears really do “hearken to the call of the earth,” like the Shetona legends say!"
84,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_038","So, um...should we start digging?"
85,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_039","You know, this soil feels a little <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> warm. And what is that smell? Mushrooms?"
86,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_040","..."
87,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_041","Ah! I found something! It's a box, and some sort of measurement device? That's enough crackling, you!"
88,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_042","Now let's see what's inside the box. Papers. Someone's report, it looks like. What's written here?"
89,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_043","“To Shaloaci, From Yyupye: Concerns About Toxic Exoray Infestation.”"
90,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_044","Yyupye? <Emphasis>The</Emphasis> Yyupye!?"
91,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_045","How does the farm's founder know my name? And why would they pen me a letter!?"
92,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_046","“I write to you regarding my concerns for the future of this farm, as well as their potential solutions.”"
93,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_047","“This farm survives by the mercy of its technological support. But if the same crops are planted again and again over a sustained period of time, there is a chance the yields will weaken.”"
94,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_048","I don't believe it. That's precisely the problem we're having!"
95,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_SHALOACI_000_049","This is a brilliant discovery, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I need to sit down and read everything that's written here. Will you go and tell Aunty Nakente about this?"
96,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_050","Ah, welcome back! That gleam in your eye tells me there's been progress. Where's Shalo?"
97,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_051","A letter with her name on it, buried in a box in the fields? Her eyes must be glued to the pages even now."
98,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_052","I wish I could offer you more details about Yyupye, but those memories must have been taken to the cloud."
99,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_053","I'm sure it must seem very strange to you that we forget the dead. Even we struggled to come to terms with it at first."
100,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_054","But we all came to the same conclusion: for the Turali citizens to make a life for ourselves out here, we would have to wear the regulators─all of us, even baby Shalo."
101,"TEXT_KINGZF202_05161_NAKENTE_000_055","At any rate, what matters is that you've managed to find a lead. Carry on with the investigation, dear, and do let me know how it goes!"
