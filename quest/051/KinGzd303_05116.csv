Gotoll Ja would share what he knows about the wivres."
1,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_SEQ_01","Apparently, wivre attacks have been on the rise in recent days, leaving Mamook in a state of both bafflement and inconvenience. Wivres are prized for their labor, making simple extermination an unviable solution. The only remaining option seems to be offering armed escorts to people traveling outside the city, but Shiidil Ja is adamantly against Gotoll Ja's involvement with such a scheme. Thanks to your insight, Gotoll Ja remembers that it is more important to ensure safety than to rush to combat, and instead starts considering diversionary tactics. He settles on a smoke bomb infused with an unappealing scent, and sends you off to Bakool Ja the wivre handler to discover what smell wivres detest.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_SEQ_02","Bakool Ja is a font of knowledge regarding wivres, and happily directs you to Cenote Jayunja where you might find scalebuds. These little buds are generally harmless, but produce an unspeakable odor when crushed─so handle with care."
3,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_SEQ_03","Gingerly, you pull scalebuds from the glowing plants of Cenote Jayunja and nestle them in your bag. May your guardian deity prevent them from being crushed on your way back to Mamook."
4,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_SEQ_04","You deliver your handful of odorous potential to Gotoll Ja who immediately confirms its potency. Reeling slightly, he confirms that he'll be able to incorporate your find into his first batch of smoke bombs. Now all that remains is to test their efficacy..."

50,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_GOTOLLJA_000_011","Even Doppro have been among the injured, and theirs is a clan that has worked with wivres since time immemorial."
51,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_SHIIDILJA_000_012","Goodness... If even Doppro can't handle them, what hope do the rest of us have? We'd be fools to step one foot outside the city."
52,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_GOTOLLJA_000_013","Not to mention what this might mean for our own wivres. If they start misbehaving, we may find ourselves without mounts or beasts of burden."
53,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_GOTOLLJA_000_014","I thought about calling upon our hunters for help with the wild ones, but culling the population can't serve us well in the long run... "

57,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_A1_000_001","What about trapping the wivres instead?"
58,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_A1_000_002","But an armed escort would still mean slaying wivres, right?"
59,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_GOTOLLJA_000_017","You raise a good point. Perhaps setting a trap or creating some diversion would better serve our interests. Our goal is to protect our people, after all."
60,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_GOTOLLJA_000_018","Wivres may be physically formidable, but they must have some weakness in their finer senses. A smell they can't tolerate, for instance."
61,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_GOTOLLJA_000_019","If we were to incorporate that deterrent into, say, a smoke bomb, that should buy anyone enough time to flee from an aggressive wivre."

67,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_BAKOOLJA_000_031","Ah yes, I heard Gotoll Ja was asking about recent wivre incidents. I'd recommend the scalebud if you're looking for something smelly. "
68,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_BAKOOLJA_000_032","You can pick them off the luminescent plants found in water-bound areas like Cenote Jayunja. Mostly unremarkable until you crush or grind them─then you'll wish you never had."
69,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_BAKOOLJA_000_033","Wivres have a keen sense of smell, so one whiff should be all you need to convince them to be elsewhere. But the same goes for people, so take care when stowing those buds in your bag, eh?"
70,"TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_BAKOOLJA_000_035","I'd try Cenote Jayunja for the scalebuds. Remember─don't crush them until you're ready to scare off a wivre. Your nose will thank me."
