49,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_YUBLI_000_002","To that end, I had these promotional flyers made up. Can I trouble you to distribute them in Ok'bek'be?"
50,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_YUBLI_000_003","Traders traveling from the capital often visit the settlement. I'd have you seek out potential customers and give them a flyer. Ideally, they'll then spread the word about our enterprise to their associates and loved ones."
51,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_YUBLI_000_004","The Hanuhanu residing in Ok'bek'be are already familiar with the agency, so try and target other Turali when handing out the flyers. Travel safely!"
52,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_CITIZENA05199_000_010","Are you here on business too?"
53,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_CITIZENA05199_000_011","“The Turali Travel Agency”... How intriguing. I must say, distributing flyers like this is such an efficient means of conveying information. I'll make sure this gets seen wherever my peddling takes me."
54,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_CITIZENA05199_000_012","Ah, it's you again. One of the friends I showed that flyer to made a booking with the agency and had a wonderful time. I'll happily take another and spread the word even further!"
55,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_CITIZENB05199_000_015","Hm? You have something for me?"
56,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_CITIZENB05199_000_016","A travel agency based in Kozama'uka? And with an office in Tuliyollal... Come to think of it, my mother is always talking about visiting the region. I'll have to show her this when I get back to the capital."
57,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_CITIZENB05199_000_017","More promotion for that new travel agency? As it so happens, a friend of mine's been asking to see the flyer. With this I can put an end to their pestering! Much obliged."
58,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_CITIZENC05199_000_020","What's the matter?"
59,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_CITIZENB05199_000_021","Hmmm. A travel agency offerin' guided tours? A fine idea! Ever since I visited Kozama'uka on business, I've been itchin' to return. With an enterprise like this in the region, I might just have to bring my family along with me."
60,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_CITIZENB05199_000_022","I'm glad you dropped by with another flyer! Some family friends were eager to find out more. I'll show 'em this next time I'm home."
61,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_YUBLI_000_025","I appreciate your help handing out the flyers. Given the number of visitors passing through, Ok'bek'be might just be the best location in Kozama'uka to promote the travel agency."
62,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_YUBLI_000_026","Of course, flyers are available outside our office in Tuliyollal, but there's nothing like a grassroots approach to really generate awareness."
63,"TEXT_BANPEL101_05199_YUBLI_000_027","Each flyer we hand out is a potential customer in the making. My job is to make sure expectations are exceeded if and when they decide to visit!"
