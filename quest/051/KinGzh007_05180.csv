The amiable elder seems starved for company."
1,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_SEQ_01","While wandering the barren Windspath Gardens, you meet an elderly woman eager for you to join her on a stroll. She strides off ahead, asking you to reconvene by the bridge in Blooms of Discovery.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_SEQ_02","You find the amiable elder gazing out across the forlorn landscape. She starts to quiz you about the nation of Lindblum, but is evidently as fond of light exercise as she is discussing historical matters, and soon sets off again."
3,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_SEQ_03","Another change of scenery, another question─this time concerning the weighty concept of nationhood. Having heard your response, the elder strides off, beckoning you to leynode aero."
4,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_SEQ_04","In what proves to be the last portion of this roving excursion through the annals, the elder explains her personal ties to Lindblum before asking you to share your thoughts. Happy that her memories of Alexandria's much-maligned neighbor live on, she fades from existence with a contented smile."

49,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_001","This place was once something of an unending dream, but by all appearances the reverie is finally over, and well, to put it simply, I've been desperate to talk with someone."
50,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_002","If you feel like stretching your legs, why don't you come and find me by the bridge here in Blooms of Discovery?"
51,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_003","Ah, I'm glad you came."
52,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_004","I'll get straight to it. How familiar are you with the nation of Lindblum?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_Q1_000_005","What will you say?"
54,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_A1_000_001","I know they were once at war with Alexandria."
55,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_A1_000_002","They are famed for manufacturing fearsome weapons, are they not?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_A1_000_003","Lind-what now?"
57,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_006","Precisely."
58,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_007","Hehe. I've always appreciated honesty."
59,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_008","Alexandria fought with its neighbor Lindblum during the Storm Surge, and it was the latter who produced the dreadful weapon that wrought disaster."
60,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_009","To focus on this period of conflict reveals a nation loathed by the people of Alexandria."
61,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_010","Yet for much of the nations' shared history, Lindblum was simply a neighbor, albeit one with rather different customs."
62,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_011","Hehe... All this talking has put me in the mood for another wander. Come and find me when you're ready to hear the rest of my ramblings."
63,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_012","Let us continue. Now, in many ways, a nation can be viewed as the culmination of technology and culture. I wonder where your interest lies?"
64,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_Q2_000_013","What will you say?"
65,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_A2_000_001","Technology all the way."
66,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_A2_000_002","I consider myself a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> of culture."
67,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_A2_000_003","It's hard to pick one over the other..."
68,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_014","I see. Regardless of your affiliation, simply taking an interest in such matters is to be commended."
69,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_015","Hehe, that's often the case, is it not? I apologize for putting you on the spot."
70,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_016","Lindblum was always revered for its technological prowess. After all, this was the nation that revolutionized travel with the invention of the air cab and the airship─designs that combined magic and machine to remarkable effect."
71,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_017","Despite such advancements, they held dear to time-honored traditions─among them “the hunt.” This festival of frenzied violence saw city streets awash with the blood of fiends─intentionally released as sport for brave warriors seeking to prove their skills."
72,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_018","A nation on the forefront of technological innovation yet steeped in the wild vestiges of its past. An interesting duality, I'm sure you'll agree."
73,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_019","Lest we get too comfortable standing here, I suggest we make for leynode aero to finish up our discussion."
74,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_020","I'm sure you have your reasons for being here, just as I have mine. Despite that, you chose to humor this old woman─and for that you have my thanks. I've had a wonderful time talking with you."
75,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_021","You might have gathered by now, but in my past life I taught history. When the time came to retire, I stayed true to my passions and began to study my family's past."
76,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_022","As I traced my lineage back through the generations, I made quite a startling discovery: one of my ancestors was originally from Lindblum. She had made her way to Alexandria around the time of the Storm Surge."
77,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_023","The war broke out not long after she married. As far as I could glean from the records, instead of returning to her native land, she remained in Alexandria for the rest of her life."
78,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_024","When I discovered my connection to Lindblum, I pledged to learn more of our longtime foe."
79,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_025","Although records were scarce, I dedicated what time I had left to my research, determined that at the very least <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> would remember the nation's fate."
80,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_026","If it's not too much to ask, I'd love to hear your thoughts about everything I've told you."
81,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_Q3_000_027","What will you say?"
82,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_A3_000_001","Such a fascinating account!"
83,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_A3_000_002","Gods, what I'd give to take part in one of those Lindblum hunts!"
84,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_A3_000_003","Another grave reminder of the tragedy of war..."
85,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_028","I'm so glad to hear that."
86,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_029","Hehe. Oh yes, I imagine a gallant adventurer like yourself would prove quite the worthy hunter!"
87,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_030","You're quite right... If it weren't for the Storm Surge, my ancestor may have had the option of returning to Lindblum one day."
88,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_031","I must apologize. Knowing that this would be my last lecture, I got a little carried away... But I simply had to share this with someone. Little did I know that I'd be blessed with such an enthusiastic student!"
89,"TEXT_KINGZH007_05180_OLDERELDITE05180_000_032","You're a kind soul indeed. May the time you have left here prove fruitful and fulfilling..."
