Zitekkwa has shown you all he can of his work as a moneylender."
1,"TEXT_KINGZE204_05143_SEQ_01","Tawmezi's plan to advertise for her upcoming performance proves to have been a success, and while Zitekkwa waits outside the dance hall for her, he suggests you go and speak with his grandfather. Having seen so much of Zitekkwa's job and the good it entails, he believes you can give a fair and honest opinion his grandfather needs to hear.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZE204_05143_SEQ_02","Toanzohe is surprised by what you tell him. He is determined now to confirm what he has heard with his own eyes, and so makes for the dance hall."
3,"TEXT_KINGZE204_05143_SEQ_03","Toanzohe keeps a comfortable distance from the dance hall and overhears Tawmezi showering Zitekkwa with gratitude. He is touched by the exchange and relieved to see his grandson grown to become a kind-hearted individual. He wishes to learn more about Zitekkwa's work, and so the two decide to talk over drinks at the saloon. Before that, however, Zitekkwa would like to have a quick word with you."
4,"TEXT_KINGZE204_05143_SEQ_04","Zitekkwa thanks you for all your help resolving the conflict between him and his grandfather. He hopes you will think of him if you ever have trouble with coin in the future. "

75,"TEXT_KINGZE204_05143_TOANZOHE_000_029","I carried so much resentment for those moneylenders, I assumed the worst when I heard about your job. I was blinded to the good you could do, and the people you could help. Like your mother helped me and your father, once upon a time."
76,"TEXT_KINGZE204_05143_TOANZOHE_000_030","You reach out a hand to those who find themselves on the brink of ruin. And with the greatest of care, you pull them back."

78,"TEXT_KINGZE204_05143_ZITEKKWA_000_033","But I'm sorry I didn't talk to you sooner. I was convinced you'd be cross with me and didn't know how to broach the topic without upsetting you."
79,"TEXT_KINGZE204_05143_TOANZOHE_000_034","Always so considerate. This town could stand to see a little more of that."
