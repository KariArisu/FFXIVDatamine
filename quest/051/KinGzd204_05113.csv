Ty'at Roh has a nervous look on his face."
1,"TEXT_KINGZD204_05113_SEQ_01","Ty'at Roh wonders aloud at the cause of the other hunters' absence before Rral Vaw himself appears in quite the distressed state. He informs you that blue, flower-like beasts have been spotted heading towards Iq Br'aax and recruits you both to hunt them down in lieu of a trial. You and Ty'at Roh are to head south to slay any blue-flowered beasts you see and investigate the source of this invasion.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZD204_05113_SEQ_02","You move south until you find Ty'at Roh standing before the corpse of one of the fiends, who the would-be hunter felled as they crept forth from the Ja Tiika Heartland. A few escaped during the struggle, and Ty'at Roh bids you to follow them before they can go any further."
3,"TEXT_KINGZD204_05113_SEQ_03","While the beasts are indeed unusual in appearance, they fall before you like all the rest. Return to Ty'at Roh, both to check on his safety and inform him that the nearby threat has been quelled."
4,"TEXT_KINGZD204_05113_SEQ_04","Ty'at Roh appears to have had no further encounters with the strange creatures, and says that a search of the area revealed no more threats. The hunter suggests you return to Iq Br'aax to inform Rral Vaw of your success."
5,"TEXT_KINGZD204_05113_SEQ_05","With the beasts driven from Iq Br'aax, Rral Vaw declares your hunt over. Although Ty'at Roh regrets that he had to rely upon you for help, the older hunter stresses that none can protect the forest alone, and welcomes the young Xbr'aal into the Brethren of Br'aax. Relieved to have passed his trial, Ty'at Roh looks forward to making his dreams come true as a full-fledged hunter."

55,"TEXT_KINGZD204_05113_RRALVAW_000_008","My partner and I will go after the beasts headed toward the village. You two head south and try to find out where these blue-flowered beasts are coming from─and if you run into any, slay them then and there!"
