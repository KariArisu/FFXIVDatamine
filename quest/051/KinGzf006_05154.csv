This is the last place you were expecting to find the Cornservant."
1,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_SEQ_01","The Cornservant has somehow found their way inside the dome and reached the outskirts. It is here that they have found a Milalla in need of their corny benevolence, and they once again turn to you to serve as their intermediary.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_SEQ_02","The hungry Milalla finds the vegetables of the outskirts to be absolutely revolting compared to the manufactured rations of Everkeep. He would sooner starve himself than take another bite, but the Cornservant has an idea to please his selective palate. Using a generous helping of kernels from their own cob, the Cornservant creates popcorn, and it is love at first bite for the Milalla. Realizing now that foods should not always be taken at face value, the Milalla runs off to apologize to the outskirts' farmers."
3,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_SEQ_03","Corn and its seemingly limitless potential has changed another life for the better. But the Cornservant's work is far from finished─not so long as there are more bellies to be fed."

49,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_CORNSERVANT_000_002","When first hearing the rumble of a stomach coming from within this dome, I mistook it for the roar of thunder, but sure enough, there was indeed a poor soul in need of my assistance. Would that I could make myself seen to them."
50,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_CORNSERVANT_000_003","I can but assume it was fate that guided you here to see them given the help they need and deserve. Please, follow me and I shall take you to them."
51,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_CORNSERVANT_000_005","This Milalla exudes overconfidence, perhaps to mask what ails his grumbling stomach."
52,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_HUNGRYMILALA05154_000_010","<retch> Try the vegetables from the outskirts, they said. Bah! Who could stand to eat this swill!? I can't do it. I won't! A man of Everkeep deserves better than this!"
53,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_HUNGRYMILALA05154_000_011","With the perfectly manufactured rations of the production facility, full to bursting with nutrients, I could easily work for days with little rest. But this? I'd sooner starve myself until my work is done."
54,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_CORNSERVANT_000_012","<rustle> A rather sophisticated palate, it would seem. Perhaps if I take a generous helping of my kernels, apply a little heat, and... <pop> <pop> <pop> There! Let us see what he thinks of my popped corn."
55,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_HUNGRYMILALA05154_000_013","What in blazes is this?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_HUNGRYMILALA05154_000_014","This is absolutely delicious! Light and fluffy, yet also crunchy, and perfectly salted. I've never seen such a thing in Solution Nine."
57,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_HUNGRYMILALA05154_000_015","And you say this was made from a vegetable? It would appear the plants grown down here are not to be underestimated. I believe I owe the farmers an apology."
58,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_CORNSERVANT_000_020","<rustle> Hahaha, the popcorn was a rousing success!"
59,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_CORNSERVANT_000_021","He convinced himself that foods should simply be taken as they are, never realizing they can become so much more given the right preparation."
60,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_CORNSERVANT_000_022","It was heartening to see something so simple as popped kernels could give him a newfound appreciation for food."
61,"TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_CORNSERVANT_000_023","And with that, I believe our work here is done. I can scarcely imagine where my search for bellies in need of nourishment will take me next. Wherever that may be, I should be glad to see you there. Safe travels, my friend."
