49,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_001","We got separated during the upheaval the other day, but I spotted her in the area not too long ago! I tried to tell her there was nothing to be afraid of now, but she didn't seem convinced..."
50,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
51,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_A1_000_001","I'm afraid I haven't seen her..."

54,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_002","You haven't? In that case, if it isn't too much to ask, perhaps you'd be so kind as to help me look for her?"

56,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_004","Did you hear that!? Is that you, my precious little fuzzy wuzzy!?"
57,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_005","Oh... Don't toy with me like that! To make up for that cruel joke, I think you should help search for her."
58,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_006","If I leave it any longer, I fear she'll get a taste for freedom and never come back! I'm sure you'll be able to coax her back, though. Please, your assistance would mean the world to me!"
59,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_007","I sensed something in you the moment we met─I'm all but certain my little fuzzy wuzzy will take a liking to you! So, what do you say? Can I count on you?"
60,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_008","Before you set off, there's something you should know: my little fuzzy wuzzy simply adores being chased. When you find her, be sure to play along and tire her out─she'll settle down soon enough. Anyway, I suggest you head to the plaza and take a look around!"
61,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_009","As I said, she loves being chased. You'll need to tire her out before trying to catch her! Good luck!"

63,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_SYSTEM_000_011","She seems to have identified you as a worthy playmate. You might be able to catch her if you tire her out."
64,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_SYSTEM_000_012","Although you get the impression the cat has near-limitless energy reserves, you resolve to give chase."
65,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_SYSTEM_100_012","Tire the cat out and then get close enough to swoop in and make your catch!"
66,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_SYSTEM_000_013","You can stop giving chase by leaving the area. You may try again by surveying the designated location."
67,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CAT05172_000_014","Mmmeowww!"
68,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_015","How did you fare? Did you find her!?"

70,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_017","You must have given her quite the chase. She looks about ready for a catnap! Honestly, it's a relief to see her unharmed and healthy."
71,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_018","I'm from Tural originally, but I was stranded here after the barrier went up. It was this little scamp's grandma that helped me through those dark days after I realized I'd be unable to return home..."
72,"TEXT_KINGZG009_05172_CATWOMEN05172_000_019","Indeed, I don't know where I'd be without all of my precious little fuzzy wuzzies. Thank you so much for your help!"
