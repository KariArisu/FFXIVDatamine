※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_SEQ_02","Liplu's guest turns out to be the Pelu in pink herself, Mablu. You listen to the friends recall a conversation in which Mablu proposed they work together to help revitalize struggling local communities through the power of tourism. And indeed, they have done just that─though both agree this is only the beginning. They will continue striving to spread happiness through trade in accordance with Pelu traditions, and you have no reason to doubt that they will succeed. Mablu bids you both farewell, while the travel agency founder waits to speak with you once again."
3,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_SEQ_03","Though the impassioned Pelu has accomplished much in a short time, she is already pondering the next steps. Regardless, it is clear that wherever Liplu takes her tourism business, she will do her utmost to ensure the benefits─and the pel─are shared by one and all."

53,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_011","So good to see you, Mablu! Welcome to the Turali Travel Agency's Kozama'uka branch!"
54,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_012","That's right, today's guest is none other than my dear friend, Mablu. I'm sure you noticed, but she's had a hand in practically every aspect of the enterprise. "
55,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_013","From procuring supplies to facilitating critical communications and relaying news from trading posts all across Tural─she's been a huge help!"
56,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_014","And let's not forget that it was Mablu who introduced me to <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>!"
57,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_015","The Turali Travel Agency wouldn't be the institution it is today without your tireless efforts. You both have my eternal gratitude!"

60,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_018","I never told you this, but after Mablu first committed to becoming a peddler, she came to the alpaca wool bedding emporium I was operating at the time and put to me a business proposal."
61,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_019","Due to recent events, Tural has known much hardship, both great and small, and she wondered if perhaps we, through our mercantile pursuits, might do something to hasten the nation's recovery."
62,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_MABLU_000_020","From the terrible storm that destroyed bridges and rendered the Flight of We Wingless impassable, to the sudden death of Gulool Ja Ja...we've had much cause to grieve. But it is our way to spread happiness through trade, and I had to believe we could still make a difference as only we Pelu could."
63,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_MABLU_000_021","When you and your comrades returned in triumph, there were festivities during which I spoke with many Turali. I sensed the people's growing desire to learn about their neighbors and share their own culture in turn. That's why I told Liplu I saw an opportunity ripe for the taking..."
64,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_022","And so I decided to establish the Turali Travel Agency. Mablu would keep in touch as she peddled her wares on the road, supporting us with her observations and insights. We were business partners in a Turali revitalization initiative, so to speak."
65,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_023","The more we expanded our operations, the more people and communities to which we could bring visitors and their pel. With everyone's help, we've enriched many lives. But this is only the beginning!"
66,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_MABLU_000_026","Through trade we'll continue to bring Turali together and give them ample cause to smile. After all, that's what we Pelu do─now and always!"
67,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_027","You're right about that! Ahh, I can hear my inner abacus clacking away. It's proud we can hold true to our traditions, and just as convinced as I am that all our dreams will come true!"
68,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_028","I hope you both keep the Turali Travel Agency in mind wherever you might be. Do be sure to send plenty of customers our way!"
69,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_030","Where would I be without you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? You've contributed so much to the agency, and aided us in assembling an amazing group of collaborators."
70,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_031","The Hanuhanu are a joy to work with, and the Moblins are thrilled to have found an all-new audience for their crafts..."

72,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_033","But as I keep saying, we wouldn't have been able to forge those ties in the first place if it weren't for your help."
73,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_034","I'm sure you're tired of me singing your praises, but I really do owe it all to you! Thanks for sticking with me as I've taken these first real steps towards my dream."
74,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_035","I wonder where the next steps will lead me. Homeward to Urqopacha? Or perhaps I should set my sights on Xak Tural? Who knows, one day the Turali Travel Agency may even have an Alexandrian branch!"
75,"TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_LIPLU_000_036","After all, a path only extends as far as you're willing to walk, and my legs have plenty of life left in them!"
