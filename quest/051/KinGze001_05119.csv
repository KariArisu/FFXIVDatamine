The sight of you sets the wheels in Nikawtenhe's head to turning."

49,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_NIKAWTENHE_000_002","Ah, but I'm getting ahead of myself. I've a package I need delivered here to the saloon. N-Nothing unsavory, mind! But I need it kept safe from curious hands and prying eyes."
50,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_NIKAWTENHE_000_003","If you'd be willing to help a desperate soul in need, make for the Tuliyollal Trailhead. A merchant should be there waiting, hopefully somewhere out of sight."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_NIKAWTENHE_000_004","I realize this is all rather sudden, but I can't think of any other way to see it delivered. You'll help me, won't you?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_CITIZENB05119_000_010","Something you need?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_CITIZENB05119_000_011","Nikawtenhe sent you, did he? All this trouble, and he couldn't be assed to pick it up himself."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_CITIZENB05119_000_012","Well, it's his money, and a rather hefty sum at that. Ordered this beauty all the way from Urqopacha. He'd be understandably cross were anything to happen to that crate, so do be careful."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_SYSTEM_000_013","Deliver the clandestine crate to a discreet location behind the saloon in Hhusatahwi before the time runs out."
56,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_SYSTEM_000_014","You will have two minutes to complete the task. Should you fail, return to the starting location and begin anew."
57,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_SYSTEM_000_015","Be wary of attacks from enemies, which will sap your strength."
58,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_CITIZENB05119_000_016","Careful with that crate. Nikawtenhe would be mighty sore were anything to happen to it."
59,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_NIKAWTENHE_000_017","The merchant was there, wasn't he? Gods...I hope he didn't run off with it."
60,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_SYSTEM_100_018","This looks like a suitable spot to place a crate. If you had one..."
61,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_SYSTEM_000_020","You arrive back at the saloon with the package safely in tow. Nikawtenhe will be glad to hear both you and the crate are in one piece."

63,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_NIKAWTENHE_000_027","You can't tell anyone, but that package is a bottle of premium Pelupelu mezcal."
64,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_NIKAWTENHE_000_028","You can find mezcal aplenty in Xak Tural, and I personally never thought much of the stuff. Until the Pelupelu changed things, that is. Story goes that a Pelupelu merchant visited one of their distilleries and complained about the poor quality of their wares."
65,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_NIKAWTENHE_000_029","Gutted by the insult, the owner was fit to throw them out. Then they tried the merchant's mezcal. Wasn't long before the Pelupelu way of distilling was adopted and refined, and for me it was love at first sip."
66,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_NIKAWTENHE_000_030","If anyone were to see me here with a bottle, it'd be empty before I could pour myself a glass."
67,"TEXT_KINGZE001_05119_NIKAWTENHE_000_031","But thanks to you, I'll be relaxing this evening with my favorite drink. Here─a little something for your trouble."
