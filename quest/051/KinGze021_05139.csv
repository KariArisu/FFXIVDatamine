49,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_001","Could I get you to deliver this polished horn to my sister?"
50,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_002","You'll find her tending the field on the outskirts of town. She shouldn't be hard to recognize─we have the same hair color."
51,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_010","Please make sure that polished horn gets to my sister in Hhusatahwi. Keep an eye out for a Hhetsarro farmer with the same color hair as me."
52,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_LIVELY05139_000_020","Oho, what can I do for you?"
53,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_LIVELY05139_000_021","Ah, this horn... I knew the day would come, but it's sad to think he's no longer with us."
54,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_LIVELY05139_000_022","I appreciate the delivery, nonetheless! I hate to ask any more of you, but there's something I want to give to my sister in return."
55,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_LIVELY05139_000_023","Harvest a handful of vegetables from that plant and take them to her, would you?"
56,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_LIVELY05139_000_024","I know I ought to do it myself, but the crops won't tend themselves... Anyway, tell her that I'll come and visit soon!"
57,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_030","Did you deliver the horn?"
58,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_040","Welcome back, traveler. Ah, but what is that you have there?"
59,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_041","So fresh and plump... These look delicious. Clearly my sister's been hard at work."
60,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_042","I suppose you're wondering why I had you deliver that horn. It came from an old rroneek bull that recently passed away. He was our hhetso─one of many creatures we Hhetsarro seek guidance from throughout our lives."
61,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_043","My sister and I─our souls are bound together through that rroneek. So too in death, as much as in life."
62,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_044","One horn I gave to my sister, the other horn I keep with me. It struck me as a fitting symbol of the connection. I'm sure she understood."
63,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_045","She may have moved to Hhusatahwi, but she's still Hhetsarro. Nothing will ever change that."
64,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_046","Anyway, judging by your message, I can expect a visit from her any day now. I should prepare a feast to welcome her back home."
65,"TEXT_KINGZE021_05139_STRICT05139_000_047","Thank you, traveler. We sisters were fortunate to have met you."
