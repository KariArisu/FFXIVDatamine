51,"TEXT_KINGZG004_05167_MOB05167_000_003","It's engraved with the name “Travertine,” but I have no idea what purpose it served to begin with. I'm dying to know the story behind it, though. Can I ask you to investigate?"
52,"TEXT_KINGZG004_05167_MOB05167_000_004","Ideally I'd do this all myself, but it's probably best I don't go around asking about the trinket <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> stole... Anyway, starting your search here at Mosaic might be a good idea. The proprietor is something of a collector of mementos and knickknacks. See what she has to say."

55,"TEXT_KINGZG004_05167_DELIA_000_011","So you're on a mission to find out the story behind this little trinket? Well, given its size, shape, and inscription, I'd say that you've got yourself a bottle tag─the sort of thing you see at bars and the like, marking out which bottle belongs to who."
56,"TEXT_KINGZG004_05167_DELIA_000_012","Unfortunately for you, Everkeep is home to dozens of drinking establishments. Figuring out where the tag was being used may take some time..."
57,"TEXT_KINGZG004_05167_DELIA_000_013","Ah, I might have spoken too soon. If you catch it in the right light, you can just make out what appears to be a tankard filled to the brim with pebbles on the back of the tag."
58,"TEXT_KINGZG004_05167_DELIA_000_014","Which leaves only one possibility: this is from a bar called the Neon Stein. They've been serving thirsty patrons on True Vue for years now. Could be worth a visit."
59,"TEXT_KINGZG004_05167_DELIA_000_015","That golden tag of yours is almost certainly from the Neon Stein. I'd suggest heading there to see what else you can find out."

62,"TEXT_KINGZG004_05167_MELANCHOLY_000_017","Yep, this is one of our bottle tags. Don't recall any regulars who went by Travertine, though. Which implies their memories are no longer with us."
