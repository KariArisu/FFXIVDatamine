0,"TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_00","Something seems to be weighing heavily on Liplu's mind.
※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_01","Due to a shortage of guides familiar with upstream Kozama'uka, the Turali Travel Agency is struggling to make the most of its recent expansion into Earthenshire. When you posit that a certain bandit gang might make for potential recruits, Liplu balks at first, given that they kidnapped Vow Wuk Lamat herself. However, the Pelu then recalls that they not only turned themselves in, but were later released on parole. As they may be interested in making a fresh start, she requests your help in tracking them down, and suggests you begin by taking a trip to Many Fires and inquiring among the locals.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_02","After speaking with the townsfolk in Many Fires, you learn that Wawkesa and his crew were pardoned by Vow Wuk Lamat herself. Recent sightings suggest the Tonawawtan leader has been eking out a law-abiding existence in the wilds outside the settlement. Liplu will wish to hear what you have learned."
3,"TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_03","Having heard your findings, Liplu is convinced there is merit in approaching Wawkesa with an offer of employment. You make for the Dewspun Bank, close to the former bandit's alleged hideout."
4,"TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_04","In the wilds, you encounter a downtrodden Wawkesa trudging back from a fruitless attempt at fishing. Mistaking Liplu's proposal as a ploy to drag him back into some past servitude, the terrified Tonawawta flees the scene. It would be prudent to regroup and discuss your next move with Liplu."
5,"TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_05","Before running off, the erstwhile bandit spoke of mines from which he escaped and resolved never to return to. As this was clearly a traumatic experience, Liplu is keen not only to hear the full story, but to clear up the misunderstanding, and to that end she asks you to find Wawkesa and bring him back."
6,"TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_06","You come across the Tonawawta gasping for breath in the lee of a rocky outcrop. Resigned to whatever fate lies in store for him, Wawkesa agrees to speak with Liplu. You prepare to reconvene with the pair in the Dewspun Bank."
7,"TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_07","Convinced at last that Liplu's proposal was genuine, the Tonawawta shares the harrowing tale of his past. Having been forced to toil in Shaaloani mines as children for many years, Wawkesa and his comrades one day realized they would need to escape or die beneath the earth. Though they made good their escape, their foreman attempted to hunt them down, and it was only by fleeing to Kozama'uka and turning to crime that they managed to evade recapture. Hearing this, Liplu reassures Wawkesa that she does not wish to bind or send him back, and once again extends him and his crew an invitation to earn an honest living at the Turali Travel Agency. Though he is unsure how precisely they may be of service, he is willing to accept, and so all leave to discuss matters further at Dock Poga."
8,"TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_08","Back at the agency, Liplu is quick to assuage Wawkesa's concerns about returning to public life. Emboldened, he and his comrades resolve to do their part and give back to the community, with Wawkesa taking charge of the brand-new eatery. When queues of hungry visitors inevitably clamor to sample the local cuisine, Liplu and company will yet again have need of their special advisor."
