49,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_002","You see, I received an order for custom paints, but the necessary ingredients are rather rare. The amra in particular is difficult to come by, as it must be taken from a vajralangula."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_003","And not just any old fruit will do! Only one held by the strongest, most virile male specimen will suffice."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_004","I know of a sure way to attract a suitable vajralangula, but I'm afraid defeating the beast is beyond me. If only a strong, brave, kind adventurer could protect poor little me!"

55,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_005","I feel safer already! Come now, I will lead you to where the vajralangula gather. We head southeast."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_006","I've kept you waiting long enough. Let's get to it, shall we?"
57,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_007","Take this perfume and douse my frail, meager body in it. I must be as a flower dripping with sweet nectar!"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_008","Quickly, now! Slather it on, else I won't catch the attention of even the weakest vajralangula."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_009","Perfect! I'm positively irresistible!"
60,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_010","Now, I'll use my wiles and enticing scent to lure a vajralangula this way. You wait here, and prepare to strike him down!"

66,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_015","Say, do you know why the vajralangula carry this fruit? They present them to their desired mates. Hence the scented oils. Pheromones, you see."
67,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_016","The amra is also the official fruit of Thavnair. You can eat it or use it as painting material as I shall, of course, but it is also said to ward off evil, and secure a strong family lineage."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZA023_04202_MACHOALCHEMIST_000_017","But there's more to this fruit than mere superstition. It has sufficient antibacterial properties to be used as a household remedy to keep any family well."
