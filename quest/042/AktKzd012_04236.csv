Yes, you're a doughty sort, aren't you? Perfect. You are <Emphasis>just</Emphasis> the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> I was in the market for."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZD012_04236_BERTHELLEMY_000_002","Our camp's stores are being pillaged, plundered, and altogether despoiled, which is troublesome indeed, as we've so little in the way of provisions as it is. Fortunately, the thieves left tracks, which the Garlean hunters of the area tell us belong to a variety of yeti known as almasty."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZD012_04236_BERTHELLEMY_000_003","The wretches are so wily, that once they've found a source of food, they come in droves, telling all their other accursed friends! So that leaves us with only one recourse: swift and bloody retribution."

I was fretting over whom to ask, when you fell straight into my lap. And you seem as good a hunter as any, right?"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZD012_04236_BERTHELLEMY_000_005","If you're willing to cooperate─and I am sure that you are─speak with the imperial hunter just outside camp. He'll set you on the right path."

56,"TEXT_AKTKZD012_04236_GARLEANHUNTER04236_000_021","I was told that I would receive assistance from one involved in the contingent's decision-making processes, but I must say...seeing you here comes as a shock. You seem the sort of person as to be above the sniping of vermin. Sure you've the time to spend on such menial tasks?"
57,"TEXT_AKTKZD012_04236_GARLEANHUNTER04236_000_022","Very well. I won't press the subject any longer. Your assistance will prove invaluable, I'm certain. Now then, time is wasting. Let's reconvene in the Eblan Rime─the almasties' territory─where we'll set the trap."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZD012_04236_GARLEANHUNTER04236_000_030","This here is the almasties' land, and considering how prolific the things are, we shouldn't have to wait long before one comes lumbering by."

67,"TEXT_AKTKZD012_04236_GARLEANHUNTER04236_000_042","You must be wondering why the blood. Well, the almasties are clever creatures─they won't willingly wander into dangerous lands, especially ones that smell of death. So, sprinkling a copious amount of their fellows' gore about the encampment ought to ensure they give us a wide berth."
