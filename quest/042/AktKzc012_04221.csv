50,"TEXT_AKTKZC012_04221_JUNE_000_002","To make matters worse, spending so much time around the tempered─with all their raving and thrashing about─takes its toll on their carers. I daresay a few words of encouragement from the champion of Eorzea will help raise their spirits."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZC012_04221_JUNE_000_003","I also have a few bottles of ether to alleviate their fatigue. Would you mind distributing these among the healers?"

59,"TEXT_AKTKZC012_04221_SOLDIERB04221_000_011","Yes...treating the tempered is a lot harder than I'd imagined. Before we came here, I'd only heard rumors of the condition, but to see it with my own eyes... No one deserves that. No one."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZC012_04221_SOLDIERB04221_000_012","That's why the work we do is so important. Once I have finished resting─as I was ordered─I shall return to the patients. I thank you for your kindness."

73,"TEXT_AKTKZC012_04221_JUNE_000_032","Even the tempered we'd seen in our homelands did little to prepare us for the sheer numbers we've encountered here. Curing them all may appear to be an insurmountable task, but we must try."
74,"TEXT_AKTKZC012_04221_JUNE_000_033","That's why maintaining morale and the well-being of our healers is so important, and you've made a valuable contribution. I'd like you to have this, by way of thanks."
