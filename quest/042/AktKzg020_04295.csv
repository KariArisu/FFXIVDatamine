49,"TEXT_AKTKZG020_04295_MOUNTOVSERVER04295_000_001","...How odd. Generally speaking, this gryps would sooner gore you than look at you. Did your creator imbue you with a special talent for soothing savage beasts, perchance?"
50,"TEXT_AKTKZG020_04295_MOUNTOVSERVER04295_000_002","Curious indeed... I daresay this calls for further experimentation. I don't suppose you would be willing to attempt a flight on its back?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZG020_04295_MOUNTOVSERVER04295_000_003","I hope that the gryps will find use as a mount, you see─but its aggression toward unfamiliar faces has precluded any real trials thus far. Please, consider it."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZG020_04295_MOUNTOVSERVER04295_000_010","You are willing to ride the gryps? Splendid! We can begin immediately─assuming you have your preferred riding trousers on."

54,"TEXT_AKTKZG020_04295_MOUNTOVSERVER04295_000_015","The both of you have wonderfully relaxed riding postures. What say you to a little tour of Elpis?"
55,"TEXT_AKTKZG020_04295_MOUNTOVSERVER04295_000_020","Noetophoreon's beauty is ever striking. Note the blossoms, which change according to Elpis's seasons and aetherial balance. A true masterwork."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZG020_04295_MOUNTOVSERVER04295_000_021","The gryps seems quite content. A result of the flowers' sweet perfume and your masterful handling, no doubt."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZG020_04295_MOUNTOVSERVER04295_000_025","These beacons are crucial to our operations here in Elpis─and make convenient lodestars for flying specimens under observation. Successful concepts sight them from a distance, and can approach without hesitation."

It scorns unfamiliar or clumsy hands, yes, but so long as it trusts its rider, it serves <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> incomparably."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZG020_04295_MOUNTOVSERVER04295_000_041","Given Hermes's own expertise, flying creatures are always subject to immense scrutiny before approval. Even so, I have no doubt that our proud friend will pass muster."
