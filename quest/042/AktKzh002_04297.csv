49,"TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_001","I'm experimenting with crossbreeding different types of plants. I was thrilled when I finally produced a whole new species...right up until the point where they rose up and floated away."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_002","Last I saw of them, they were headed toward the eastern side of the island. I managed to wrangle a goodly number, but there are still eight or so missing. Could you help me recapture them?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_003","Thank you. Here, use this aetheric rope to capture say, four of them, and I can hopefully handle the rest."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_005","Did you catch the plants?"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_006","Thank goodness for that, though I'd expect no less from Azem's familiar. I rounded up my half as well, which means they're all back safe and sound."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_007","They're part yggdreant, you see. It's no surprise they inherited the eyes, but having them wander off on their own was rather unexpected."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_008","To tell the truth, I never really had a specific use in mind for them. I suppose I'd best start thinking about that... The Bureau of the Architect won't be impressed with my new creation unless it serves a purpose."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_009","With that in mind, I believe there's research to be done. Thank you for your help, and do pass on my regards to Azem."
