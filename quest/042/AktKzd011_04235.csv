49,"TEXT_AKTKZD011_04235_ILIETTE_000_001","In light of our work to aid the people of Garlemald, the Ist Legion put to us an offer: their service machina is ours should we want it. Though, as we've all recently learned, nothing is ever so easy, as the magitek in question still lies within the city limits."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZD011_04235_ILIETTE_000_002","The selfsame engineer who gifted us with this information has offered to escort you to the site. That's right, you─mentioned you by name, even. I would never force you to attend to a task so perilous, but it would be a great boon for our cause were we to wrangle that machina to our purposes."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZD011_04235_ILIETTE_000_003","The area in question is sadly littered with detritus of all manner, making exploration difficult, if not impossible. To that end, here.

54,"TEXT_AKTKZD011_04235_GARLEANSOLDIER04235_000_020","You came. I half expected you might not, given the dangers. Then again, you are Eorzea's champion, and what sort of hero balks in the face of a challenge, eh? Forgive my excitement. I've been wanting to make your acquaintance for some time now."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZD011_04235_GARLEANSOLDIER04235_000_021","Yes, well, anyway...shall we be off, then? Find me at Regio Urbanissima, and I shall escort you from there. Far easier that way, trust me."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZD011_04235_GARLEANSOLDIER04235_000_030","Well, this is a bother. The magitek I've my eye on doesn't seem to be quite as accessible as I hoped. There's just so much accursed wreckage in the way, we won't be able to drag the thing out... Hmmm, a pickle indeed. Hate to ask, but have you any brilliant ideas up that sleeve of yours?"
57,"TEXT_AKTKZD011_04235_GARLEANSOLDIER04235_000_031","You've some explosives on you? That will do the trick, certainly. "

63,"TEXT_AKTKZD011_04235_GARLEANSOLDIER04235_000_053","I had been taught that our country's cornerstone was peace, one founded upon the ways of science and machine. How can we make such a claim when internecine strife lays waste to our lands, kills our people?"

77,"TEXT_AKTKZD011_04235_ILIETTE_000_071","There was a lightness about him, one I hadn't seen when first he spoke to me. It was as if a weight had fallen clean off his shoulders."
