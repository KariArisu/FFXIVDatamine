48,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_000","Greetings! I'm the Loporrit in charge of the children's romping grounds. I expect it will be quite the challenge keeping the children of Etheirys entertained with limited space and supplies...but I daresay I'm up to it!"
49,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_001","In fact, I but recently came up with a new game that requires no props nor preparation. I call it “The Loporrits Never Stoporrit (Name Pending Livingway's Approval).” Care to give it a go?"
50,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_002","I knew you would! Now, the game is very simple─you need only count the Loporrits hopping this way and that way...or possibly no way...before time is up."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_003","I have the perfect place picked out to play─follow me to the Carrotorium!"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_010","Do you see the carrot creation station there? When you're ready, see if you can count how many Loporrits are sneaking about it."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_SYSTEM_000_011","Inspect the designated location to begin counting Loporrits."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_SYSTEM_000_012","You will have thirty seconds to complete the task, after which you may give your answer to the playful Loporrit."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_013","See if you can count the number of Loporrits there at the carrot creation station. It's not as easy as it looks! ...Assuming it looks easy. Does it?"
56,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_SYSTEM_000_014","Try counting the Loporrits again?"
57,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_020","So, do you think you counted them right? How many Loporrits did you see?"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"

62,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_021","Oooh, so close! How about giving it one more try?"
63,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_022","We have a winner! Hm? Too easy, you say? Well, it's no fun if it's too hard!"
64,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_023","And you <Emphasis>did</Emphasis> have fun, didn't you!? Wait, hold that thought─our time here is nearly up, and structure is important for productive play. You can tell me all about the fun you had after we've returned to Bestways Burrow instead."
65,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_030","Now, tell me what you think. Was it a good game? Do you think the other children will like it, too?"
66,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_031","You're an <Emphasis>adult</Emphasis>? Goodness, I'm so sorry! It's just, I was told that the people of Etheirys are at least twice our height, and you're so... Ahem. Well, as for the matter at hand..."
67,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_032","Now, tell me what you think. I'm confident the children will like it, and it cuts back on equipment costs as well. I see no downsides! So..."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_033","I want to hear your honest opinion. How was it?"
69,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
70,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_A2_000_001","I had a great time!"

72,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_A2_000_003","I've actually played this before."
73,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_034","Wonderful! I knew I came up with a terrific game, but hearing it from you is all the more reassuring!"
74,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_035","Oh, I see... Well, I appreciate your honesty. Looks like it's back to the drawing board with me."
75,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_036","What!? And here I thought I had come up with a new and exciting idea! I'll have to improve on it to make something truly unique..."
76,"TEXT_AKTKZE006_04245_LOPORRITSA04245_000_037","Thank you for taking the time to play with me. If I come up with a new game, I'll be sure to seek your expert opinion!"
