Scouts must excel in keeping themselves hidden, but when even their own comrades cannot locate them, there is surely trouble afoot."

68,"TEXT_AKTKZC013_04222_TALON_000_032","I doubt he'd find much food in that particular area, so it must've been fuel he was after. If I were him, I'd try that enormous extraction facility on the lake, but it sounds like he was hoping to get ceruleum from the water itself."
69,"TEXT_AKTKZC013_04222_TALON_000_033","Seems like a tricky task at the best of times, although I expect the folks around those parts have their methods. If so, they could probably stay holed up for months on end, providing there's enough food to go around."
