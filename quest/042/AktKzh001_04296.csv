49,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_001","Good. I could use your help with something."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_002","You see, I was asked to assess a one-eyed giant created as a facility guard, and so pit it against a lotis to test its fighting skills."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_003","Not only did the giant fall to a single blow, the lotis went into a frenzy and escaped..."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_004","In my opinion, compact familiars like you are far more effective than these overly large brutes, and this is my chance to prove it. Do you think you can handle our runaway combatant?"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_Q1_000_005","What will you say?"
54,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_A1_000_001","So long as there's something in it for me."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_A1_000_002","Fine, I'll help."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_006","Of course you'll be well rewarded for your efforts. Our experiment was conducted to the east, so that's as good a place as any to start looking for the lotis."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_007","There it is! It would seem the escaped lotis came back of its own accord."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_008","They usually feed off their foes to revitalize themselves, and I imagine it hungers after running amok like that."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_009","I'll take care of the situation here. The lotis is all yours."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_010","Don't worry about me. Just make sure that lotis doesn't cause any more trouble."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_011","You certainly made quick work of that lotis. I had a feeling I could count on you."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_012","As for the giant, it's far too heavy for us to move. I'll arrange for some broad-backed creations to haul it away after we return to Poieten Oikos."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_013","As I suspected, a smaller, more agile concept has far more facility for adapting to combat situations. Thank you for proving my theory."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZH001_04296_OBSERVER04296_000_014","I'll be sure to keep your performance in mind the next time I design a familiar. Your reward, as promised."
