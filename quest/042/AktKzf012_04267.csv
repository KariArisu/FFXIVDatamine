48,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_000","Hmm. The stories paint you as ferocity incarnate, and by the sight of you I don't reckon they're too far from the truth. You mind lendin' me an onze of that ferocity to catch some prey?"
49,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_001","The healers from the village have tasked me with huntin' down a beast possessin' a right deadly venom. I'm at a loss as how to go about it─but with two strappin' hunters, I'm sure we'll find a way. So, are you with me?"
50,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_002","I look forward to seein' what you can do! Well then, our mark is to the north. I trust you'll keep up with me."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_010","You came. Good. I thought there was a slim possibility you'd lose heart and slink off, but I'm glad to be proven wrong."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_011","I've set up three traps around the perimeter. Pieces of fresh meat mixed with medicine that'll dull the senses of any beast greedy enough to eat them. If they worked like I think they should, all you should have to do is scoop the bhujamga up in this sack."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_012","Now, animals aren't known for sharin', so there's a chance one might try to take our prize. If one does, slay it and bring it to me. I'm sure I'll think of a way to use it."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_100_012","I think I can leave the rest in your hands. I'm off to hunt a different prey─one with too many legs and an altogether unpleasant disposition. When we're both done with our tasks, let's meet back here. Best of luck."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_020","You've got a healthy look about you─I take it that means you avoided any run-ins with the venom, eh? Let me see what you caught."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_021","...By the Twelve! You managed to <Emphasis>kill</Emphasis> one!? It takes three of us days of plannin' to achieve such a feat, yet you did it with nary a bead of sweat on your brow. The stories were true, indeed!"
57,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_022","I'll take this to the healers straightaway. Find me again in the village and you'll have your well-deserved reward."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_030","It's good to see you returned, friend. The healers were impressed with our work, but I made sure they knew it was <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> who single-handedly slew that bhujamga."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZF012_04267_HUNTER04267_000_031","The healers use their venom to make a salve that numbs the skin─useful for when they need to cut the rot out or administer some other ghastly treatment. Anyroad, good work today─may the hunt be prosperous!"
