Pray deliver this letter to the unassuming Miqo'te scholar who can usually be found sequestered in a quiet corner of the Confluence.
Many thanks.</Emphasis>"

53,"TEXT_AKTKZC002_04211_CORNERSTUDENT_000_006","The place where you chanced upon this is one of dubious prominence. Students are confined there as punishment for...recalcitrant behavior. I believe I recognize the hand which penned this message."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZC002_04211_CORNERSTUDENT_000_007","The student is an acquaintance of mine, although that might be a rather generous term. Several days ago he was confined there for concocting an explosive alchemical compound and using it to “surprise” his teachers. His little stunt ended with half the gardens in the Teachers' Quarters in ashes."

64,"TEXT_AKTKZC002_04211_CORNERSTUDENT_000_017","Long ago, one of the students confined within these rooms spent his days unraveling some of the most troublesome mathematical problems of the time. With nothing to distract his attention, he was quite successful."
