51,"TEXT_AKTKZF016_04271_INTROUBLEADVENTURER_000_004","Could I ask you to take these two missives to the High Crucible and House Balyk, respectively? I can manage the third one on my own. Return and meet me here when the job's done, and I'll see you're duly compensated for your efforts."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZF016_04271_ISU_000_005","Welcome to the High Crucible of Al-Kimiya, friend! How might I be of service?"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZF016_04271_ISU_000_006","What's that? You've a letter addressed to us? Why, this is from Master Jalzahn! Last I heard, he was doing field research in Eorzea. I do hope all's well..."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZF016_04271_ISU_000_007","...Why, I can scarce believe it! Word of our plight reached him from across the sea, and he's arranged for a shipment of vital supplies to be shipped from Rowena's House of Splendors!"
