50,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_HIPPOTHOE_000_002","However, the ailouroi have one more <Emphasis>very</Emphasis> special capability. Aren't you curious?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_HIPPOTHOE_000_003","You will be pleased to know that I have dispatched one additional ailouros to fly about the Twelve Wonders, then. If she is working as designed, the phenomenon should be clearly observable."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_HIPPOTHOE_000_004","I expect that you will be able to collect evidence of it from my fellow researchers...say, Oloros, Deukalion, and Chloris? Do present your conclusions to me when you've finished!"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_GEALCAT04289_000_007","Mrrrp!"
54,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_HIPPOTHOE_000_010","What fun would it be if I told you in advance? Better that you reach your own conclusions."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_OLOROS_000_020","Isn't this the most darling familiar you have ever seen?"
56,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_OLOROS_000_021","Behold its soft and fluffy fur, its pudgy belly, its charming little bell! Its eyes that gaze imploringly into the very depths of your soul!"
57,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_OLOROS_000_022","It makes you want to dismantle it and gobble its adorable aether right up, does it not?"
58,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_OLOROS_000_023","I dare not, of course─whoever it belongs to would be quite cross indeed. Yet even to gaze upon it stokes within me a creative passion the likes of which I've never known!"
59,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_GEALCAT04289_000_024","(-Ailouros-)M-Meeew..."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_OLOROS_000_025","Alas, my muse! Perhaps I need create my own familiar of surpassing cuteness after all..."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_DEUKALION_000_030","A tiny winged creature? Do you refer to Hippothoe's familiar, perchance? I did see it not long ago."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_DEUKALION_000_031","I know not where it's gone off to, I regret to say. I would assist in your search, but I must put brush to parchment before I forget what I meant to write."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_DEUKALION_000_032","Outside of my observational duties, I have been laboring over a treatise on aquatic flora, you see. Yet rereading my work a moment ago, I was suddenly struck with how trite my conclusion sounds."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_DEUKALION_000_033","I believe I know precisely how to strengthen it, however. I daresay even Halmarut shall be impressed by my insight!"
65,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_CHLORIS_000_040","I would advise you to keep your head down─I saw some manner of creature darting about in the air just now. If it carries on like that, it's only a matter of time before it collides with someone's skull."
66,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_CHLORIS_000_041","It startled me so badly that I accidentally created a winged fish─of all things!─which itself escaped to the skies ere I knew it..."
67,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_CHLORIS_000_042","Though, now that I have a moment to reflect on its speedy departure, perhaps the ability to fly is not so wasted upon aquatic creatures as I believed. Surely such a boon would give them heretofore unknown capacity to evade predation..."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_CHLORIS_000_043","The recent fashion for flying concepts may have something to it after all. I really must pay visit to the Bureau of the Architect next I'm in Amaurot─I doubt anyone has registered a <Emphasis>winged fish</Emphasis> yet."
69,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_OLOROS_000_050","Soft fur...wide eyes... Hmm, what else should I add?"

71,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_CHLORIS_000_060","We were fortunate that it was a <Emphasis>happy</Emphasis> accident this time, of course. You know how it is─someone yells, “surprise!” and suddenly you've created a stunted serpent with yellow stripes or some nonsense. We can't have that."

75,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_HIPPOTHOE_000_072","After all, we are at our best─and our brightest─when our hearts are at ease. With clarity of thought and faith in ourselves, we can do anything."

79,"TEXT_AKTKZG014_04289_HIPPOTHOE_000_076","With today's results, the ailouros concept will be approved in no time. I am truly fortunate to have such wonderful familiars to work with─yourself included, of course!"
