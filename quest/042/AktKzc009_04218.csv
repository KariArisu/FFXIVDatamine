74,"TEXT_AKTKZC009_04218_BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216_000_051","Truth be told, my motivations for being here aren't entirely out of a sense of duty. My father was conscripted into the Garlean forces long ago, so when I heard that refugees had been found here, I had to meet them for myself."
75,"TEXT_AKTKZC009_04218_BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216_000_052","I volunteered for this duty, but unfortunately none of the refugees stirred my memories of him."
