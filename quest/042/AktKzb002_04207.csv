50,"TEXT_AKTKZB002_04207_RESIDENTS04207_000_002","Look at this place... It's a shame what they did to it, those villains from the tower."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZB002_04207_RESIDENTS04207_000_003","I wish you could have seen the hatchery before all this happened. Until only very recently, it was busy as you please, selling meat, eggs, and poison extracts to eager merchants from across Thavnair and beyond..."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZB002_04207_RESIDENTS04207_000_004","But lamenting the facts won't undo what's done, will it? Let's get to work."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZB002_04207_RESIDENTS04207_000_005","Your task will be to sprinkle the nests with this pungent solution, which should keep the wildlife from making their lairs in the ruins. Most creatures won't come within ten yalms of it, but the hamsa don't seem to mind the smell."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZB002_04207_RESIDENTS04207_000_006","And although we should probably clear away those old nests while we're at it, I want the birds to have a familiar sight to come back to...one day. Anyway, you get on with the sprinkling, and I'll start shifting the rubble."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZB002_04207_RESIDENTS04207_000_007","We have a half-dozen vials of that solution, so don't be afraid to slosh it around!"
56,"TEXT_AKTKZB002_04207_SYSTEM_000_010","You find a large egg in one of the nests. Even covered with the stink of the solution, it may prove too tempting for any nearby predator. It might be safest to hand the egg to the Arkasodara youth..."

59,"TEXT_AKTKZB002_04207_RESIDENTS04207_000_013","Whether the mother can return to hatch it, however, is another story... I realize we've only just begun cleaning up here, but I think it's best I get this egg back safely to the Great Work."
