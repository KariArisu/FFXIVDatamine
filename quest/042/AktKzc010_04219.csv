Keeping tabs on its supplies does not appear to be the Ilsabard contingent's forte."

Seeing as you're on good terms with practically everyone here─better than me, at any rate─perhaps you could help?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZC010_04219_OFFICER04219_000_003","Much appreciated. I've already sent one of my subordinates to speak with the Maelstrom, Temple Knights, and Ala Mhigan Resistance."

62,"TEXT_AKTKZC010_04219_MENUKI_000_012","Hmm... There is one thing that springs to mind. We brought several bolts of felt, which might seem a bit odd to some."

64,"TEXT_AKTKZC010_04219_MENUKI_000_014","We also have a whole crate of what you might call “warming stones” in the common tongue. Hold one in your hands and you'll see what I mean. There are plenty of those to go around as well."

67,"TEXT_AKTKZC010_04219_KOCHACHA_000_017","We do appear, however, to have overestimated how many tents we would need, and find ourselves with a surplus of cloth. We soon discovered, however, that when folded up, the tent sheets make for surprisingly good bedding. I'd be happy to donate a few."

80,"TEXT_AKTKZC010_04219_OFFICER04219_000_032","In all honesty, I was worried that taking in all those imperials might put everyone, including them, in a very unfavorable position.

81,"TEXT_AKTKZC010_04219_OFFICER04219_000_033","A valid point, perhaps, until you stop to consider the terrible fate that has befallen Garlemald. I wouldn't wish that on anyone... In any case, they're the reason we're here in the first place, so it's our duty to lend them what aid we can."
