I have a job that I believe will suit you perfectly. There's a reward at the end of it, if that motivates you to keep listening."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZF010_04265_QERYDE_000_001","I make my living as a weaver, and I've had an idea to craft armor for the Radiant Host that defend our walls. However, the scales I require are in short supply."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZF010_04265_QERYDE_000_002","Scales from long-lived pisaca are nigh indestructible, but such animals lead quick and brutal lives. Finding an aged specimen is difficult─slaying one even more so."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZF010_04265_QERYDE_000_003","Still, they are animals all the same, and cannot resist the allure of fresh meat. If you were to use the corpse of a guhasaya, then the scent of its blood will surely draw out a prize specimen. It's a somewhat dangerous task, but I suspect you've seen much worse."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZF010_04265_QERYDE_000_004","First, slay a guhasaya, then use its corpse to draw out a pisaca. I'm sure you're already well familiar with the process from there."

54,"TEXT_AKTKZF010_04265_QERYDE_000_011","Why, these are even more splendid than I could've imagined. The pisaca are dangerous prey, to be sure, but the reward from conquering them is well worth it."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZF010_04265_QERYDE_000_012","In our legends they are portrayed as devils that feast upon the flesh of man. The goddess Minduruva brought one low by piercing its eye, as nowhere else would yield to her weapon."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZF010_04265_QERYDE_000_013","The legends have an onze of truth to them, for over many years, the pisaca's scales become imbued with metallic substances. By weaving them into thread, one can make a material of uncommon strength. "
57,"TEXT_AKTKZF010_04265_QERYDE_000_014","Surely our defenders would appreciate garments made of such material, yes? I cannot fight myself, but if such skills as I possess can help us through this struggle, then I must do what I can."
