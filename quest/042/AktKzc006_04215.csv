51,"TEXT_AKTKZC006_04215_ISILSWYS_000_003","They are quite ornery in their current state, and I'm afraid few of us are suited for combat. For you, however, books should be a simple enemy to best, if it comes to that."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZC006_04215_ISILSWYS_000_004","As I said before, five volumes are skulking about at present. I've prepared a solution that should calm their rage somewhat, but they may require a few knocks on the spine before you can carry them safely. Would you be so kind as to collect them for us?"

55,"TEXT_AKTKZC006_04215_SYSTEM_000_010","The book is chomping at the air, as if to ward off anyone from coming too close. Use the powder to put it to sleep, but keep watch for your fingers."

61,"TEXT_AKTKZC006_04215_ISILSWYS_000_023","Unfortunately, this incident isn't the first of its kind. Books protected by this manner of ward must only be handled with gloves woven from the selfsame grass I used to make the sleeping powder."
