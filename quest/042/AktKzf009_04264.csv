49,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSA04264_000_001","I would ask you to search for my father. I haven't seen him for bells, and after asking around it seems he may have left the village and ventured north."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSA04264_000_002","The divinities only know why he went alone, but if I were to follow him I'd likely end up at the bottom of some beast's belly within a malm. Please, find him and return him safely to our home."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSA04264_000_003","Please, bring my father back. He's even less of a fighter than I am!"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSB04264_000_005","Oh, thank the heavens! I had resigned myself to becoming food for those dreadful things!"
53,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSB04264_000_006","What's that? My daughter sent you to find me? I thought no one saw me leave the village, but I suppose I am not so sly as I thought. And now I've caused her, and you, no end of worry."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSB04264_000_007","The number of people fleeing to our village increases by the day, and although I would never begrudge them protection, it does put a strain on our food supplies. I took up my old fishing equipment hoping I could make some small contribution."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSB04264_000_008","Children need hearty meals to grow, after all. Filling our stores is the least I can do to ease us through these troubled times. Think you could help this old fool on his errand?"
56,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSB04264_000_009","Your generosity is much appreciated. I've already set up several cages near the water. All you have to do is check them and bring me anything they've caught."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSB04264_000_010","I've set up cages around the river. See if they've caught anything, and if so, bring it here."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSB04264_000_015","I trust the river wasn't too cold for you. So, what'd you find? I hope my fishing skills haven't gone rusty in my old age."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSB04264_000_016","Ah, that's what I like to see. Plump and juicy, just what we need. This'll keep the refugees fed for another day, I reckon."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSB04264_000_017","And that's how we have to get through this: one day at a time. All right, let's return to my daughter. I'm sure she's had her fill of worry on my account."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSA04264_000_020","I've been waiting for you! My father returned and told me about all you did for him and for our village. It seems I owe you thanks for two good deeds today."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSA04264_000_021","Palaka's Stand has long been a place where the stewards of the shrines and tombs resided. That's to say, we've been focused mainly on meeting the needs of the departed, not the living."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSA04264_000_022","As such, I understand my father's desire to see our food stores bolstered, but if he gets himself killed, we'll all be worse off for it."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZF009_04264_RESIDENTSA04264_000_023","Thankfully, we needn't worry about that. For today, at least. Take this as a gesture of gratitude from both Father and I."
