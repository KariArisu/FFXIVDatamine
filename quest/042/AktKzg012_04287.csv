49,"TEXT_AKTKZG012_04287_BLASTE_000_001","Oh, I don't believe we've met. As much as I would like to engage in more meaningful conversation, I am actually in the midst of searching for someone."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZG012_04287_BLASTE_000_002","It's my mentor, who taught me practically everything I know. Now, she has relinquished her role and is ready to make her final journey. But before she does, there is an important matter I must convey to her."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZG012_04287_BLASTE_000_003","The last concept in her care─a beautiful, winged creature─has been approved for life on Etheirys!"
52,"TEXT_AKTKZG012_04287_BLASTE_000_004","Please, will you help me look for her? There is a strong chance you will find her at Philomythes Notos. Her most distinguishing feature is her chestnut-colored hair, tied into a single, flowing lock, much like a monoceros's tail."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZG012_04287_BLASTE_000_010","I have sent a familiar of my own to the north to look for my mentor. I would be very grateful if you could search elsewhere, starting with Philomythes Notos."
