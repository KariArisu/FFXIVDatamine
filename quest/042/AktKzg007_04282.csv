50,"TEXT_AKTKZG007_04282_PARAMONOS_000_002","I should warn you, however, they tend to be rather uncooperative. Aggressively so, in fact. The familiars previously recruited for this task all met with most unfortunate ends. A terrible waste, but let us not dwell on such things."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZG007_04282_PARAMONOS_000_003","Here, take this aetherially imbued rope, and use it to restrain the ophions. Remember, I require living samples.
