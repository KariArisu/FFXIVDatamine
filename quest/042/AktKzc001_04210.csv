48,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_PASSEMERRANT_000_001","You there. From some distant and exotic land, yes? I require a fresh perspective for the next step in my research, if you have a few moments to spare."
49,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_PASSEMERRANT_000_002","Do not worry, nothing too complex will be required of you. I am planning an introductory class that will educate younglings on the practical applications of aetheric energy, and I seek opinions on the lesson plan."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_PASSEMERRANT_000_003","With any luck, it shall strike a spark which ignites a lifelong love of learning and curiosity. Considering my lofty goals, I welcome honest feedback, even if it isn't entirely positive. Will you help?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_PASSEMERRANT_000_004","Thank you, my eager student. Together I daresay we are building the future. Pray visit my colleague in Tranquility. A burly Roegadyn fellow, his imposing frame belies a brilliant mind."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_PASSEMERRANT_000_005","My colleague is even now making preparations in Tranquility. Seek him out to begin the class."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_006","Ah, you must be the help Passemerrant sent word about. Are you ready to begin your education?"
54,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_007","Firstly, observe the object next to me. No mere rock, it is an experimental apparatus designed to simulate the movement of aether through the environment. Through it I intend to demonstrate how crystals are formed."
55,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_008","Now, the next order of the day is to use this explosive to destroy the device. Do not be afraid─your extremities are safe, I assure you."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_009","Go on, use that explosive to destroy the device. Do not worry─they are so weak that even a child should be safe. Should be."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_010","Very good, very good. Did you enjoy yourself, little one? Now you have your very own crystal. Aether flows all around us─an invisible energy that nourishes all things."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_011","When a physical object so suffuse with aether is destroyed, it releases the energy contained within it into its surroundings. Some returns to the environment, but some remains in the physical realm."
59,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_012","Thus are crystals formed. In simple terms, they are the physical manifestation of aether, frozen in time. Simple enough to understand, yes?"
60,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
61,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_A1_000_001","I've heard those words before, but never in that order."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_A1_000_002","You've opened my eyes. My hunger for knowledge has been piqued."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_013","Ah...is that so? Any Sharlayan youngling could recite those facts from memory. However, I may not always have the luxury of teaching such cultivated minds, as today has demonstrated."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_014","Yes... We must be more thorough with our explanations. So thorough that even the unlearned would have no trouble understanding them. Thank you for your frank opinion─sometimes an outside point of view can illuminate otherwise unseen faults. "
65,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_015","Truly? Why, that is encouraging to hear. Truth be told, I was afraid my explanations would be incomprehensible to those not already academically inclined."
66,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_016","While crystals themselves are a common sight, the exact principles that govern the process of their creation are still a subject of much debate among my peers."
67,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_017","After this little display, I intend to open the floor to discussion amongst the participants. I want them to ask the most fundamental question in all research: why?"
68,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_BIGSTUDENT_000_018","You have given us much to consider. As for the matter of compensation, my colleague is in charge of that. Please return to him to receive it."
69,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_PASSEMERRANT_000_019","Ah, there is my bushy-tailed student! Was the experiment to your liking? Children are ever so fond of explosions."
70,"TEXT_AKTKZC001_04210_PASSEMERRANT_000_020","Your payment? Oh, yes, of course. Besides whatever knowledge you gained today─free of charge, mind you─take this. And of course, you are always welcome to join us after I've revised my lesson plan."
