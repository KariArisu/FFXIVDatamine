52,"TEXT_AKTKZF005_04260_DANCER04260_000_004","Now, I know most of these words, but in this order they seem to lose all meaning. I'm having particular trouble with the phrase “stone trunk.” What could it be referring to?"

57,"TEXT_AKTKZF005_04260_DANCER04260_000_005","Ah, indeed. When you put it that way, the link becomes quite clear! And the sun would look quite striking near the Font of Maya, where indeed such a statue towers over its surroundings!"

59,"TEXT_AKTKZF005_04260_DANCER04260_000_007","That must be it. It's worth a look, at any rate. I think I'll go there now, in fact. Are you coming along? Surely you'd like to know if we've cracked this riddle."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZF005_04260_DANCER04260_000_008","Good, good! It's always better to have a companion at your side. Well then, let's make haste to the Font of Maya─first one there gets pick of the treasure!"

62,"TEXT_AKTKZF005_04260_DANCER04260_000_011","The treasure this trunk is supposed to lead us toward, and the hand which holds the key. For expediency's sake, I say we split up."

75,"TEXT_AKTKZF005_04260_DANCER04260_000_021","Curious. This jewel appears quite ancient. Judging from the symbols etched into it, it once belonged to an Arkasodara practitioner of magic."
76,"TEXT_AKTKZF005_04260_DANCER04260_000_022","Not surprising, I suppose. The place we found it was once used by their mages for various rituals and such."

78,"TEXT_AKTKZF005_04260_DANCER04260_000_024","I feel ill deserving of such a prize. I shall use this to help the refugees, to rebuild their shattered homes. As for you, well, I did promise you a share, yes? Not exactly half, but I hope it pleases."
