49,"TEXT_AKTKZF004_04259_CAPTAIN04259_000_001","I would ask my brothers and sisters of the Radiant Host, but our numbers have been greatly diminished. It is all we can do to keep the darkness from swallowing this settlement whole."

51,"TEXT_AKTKZF004_04259_CAPTAIN04259_000_003","We should begin our patrol by heading south, a route through which many refugees from Yedlihmad pass."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZF004_04259_CAPTAIN04259_000_004","We will cover more ground if we split into two groups. If you should find anyone in need, go to their aid, and if you discover any discarded effects, collect them for safekeeping."

64,"TEXT_AKTKZF004_04259_CAPTAIN04259_000_022","There is a legend that tells of a Manusya goddess who sought the strength of the Mrga, wresting her own head from her body and replacing it with the bestial pate of the Mrga."
65,"TEXT_AKTKZF004_04259_CAPTAIN04259_000_023","In pursuit of wisdom did a Mrga do the same, replacing his own head with that of a Manusya. Thus were born divine beings gifted with both strength and wisdom, heralding an age of untold peace."
66,"TEXT_AKTKZF004_04259_CAPTAIN04259_000_024","One of the refugees must have dropped this in their flight. This figure is a reminder that the most insurmountable hardships can be overcome by looking beyond the bounds of tribe for help."
