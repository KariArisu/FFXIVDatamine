50,"TEXT_AKTKZA024_04203_JALAMUC_000_003","You're too kind! She should be in Kadjaya's Footsteps. Keep an eye out for a Hyur with black hair."
51,"TEXT_AKTKZA024_04203_JALAMUC_000_004","I'm sure she'll be happy to see you. She was out the last time you were by, and she was devastated that she missed out on the chance to meet the adventurer aiding the Students of Baldesion."
