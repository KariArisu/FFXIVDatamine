48,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_000","Aha! I knew I'd find one of you eventually. Can you talk? I have so many things I wish to ask you!"
49,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_001","We have learned much about you thanks to our collaborators on Etheirys, but it has become clear there is a great deal they neglected to mention. Your stunted growth, for example."
50,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_002","Rather than speculate on other crucial details we may have overlooked, we're hoping you can clarify a few things, if that's all right?"
51,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_003","Thank you so much! A few of my fellow Loporrits are sure to have burning questions of their own. If you could wait here a moment, I'll go and fetch them."
52,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_SYSTEM_000_005","The following event cannot be skipped. You may wish to cancel any pending Duty Finder registrations."
53,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_010","Sorry to keep you waiting."
54,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_100_010","Now, then. Shall we get started?"
55,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSB04243_000_011","First, we'd like to ask about typical methods of stress relief."
56,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSB04243_100_011","We have read that, when thrust into a new and otherwise unfamiliar environment, the people of Etheirys can become quite stressed. Should the worst come to the worst and they're forced to relocate here to the moon, well..."
57,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSB04243_200_011","We're considering a number of contingencies based on what we've read, but being a native of Etheirys yourself, we're quite curious to know how you prefer to relieve stress."
58,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
59,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_A1_000_001","Exercise always helps me relax."
60,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_A1_000_002","I usually sleep my troubles away."
61,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_A1_000_003","Breaking the bones of my enemies is quite therapeutic."
62,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSB04243_000_012","Exercise, you say? Fascinating! I don't believe we have facilities quite suited for exercise, but fear not─it's nothing a little renovation cannot fix."
63,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSB04243_000_013","Interesting. Perhaps we should consider creating sleep-inducing carrots to help people relax."
64,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSB04243_000_014","You what!? Oh dear, how barbaric! I suppose the exertion required to do so can help relieve stress... Perhaps we can repurpose our supporters for mock combat."
65,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSB04243_000_015","That was certainly enlightening, thank you. We'll make a paradise out of the moon yet. Just wait and see!"
66,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSC04243_000_016","I too have a rather pertinent question─what do your people do for recreation?"
67,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSC04243_100_016","We have pored over every book provided to us from cover to cover, but the answer yet eludes us."
68,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSC04243_200_016","As such, we're quite certain what few ideas we had for entertainment are wanting for inspiration. So tell us, what do you enjoy?"
69,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_Q2_000_000","What will you say?"
70,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_A2_000_001","Eating always raises my spirits."
71,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_A2_000_002","Travel and exploration of the unknown can be quite exhilarating."
72,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_A2_000_003","The carnage of battle makes my heart sing."
73,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSC04243_000_017","Now that I can relate to! We'll be sure to prepare plenty of carrots so you can eat to your heart's content."
74,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSC04243_000_018","Oh, good. There are myriad places to visit on the moon aside from Mare Lamentorum. They all look more or less the same, though..."
75,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSC04243_000_019","Urgh, so uncivilized! But fighting can be entertaining in its own way, I suppose. I wonder if any of our facilities could be adapted into an arena of sorts."
76,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSC04243_000_020","I think I have a better idea of what needs to be done next. Thank you!"
77,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_021","One last question, if I may. And perhaps the most important we could ask of you."
78,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_100_021","Do you...like carrots?"
79,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_Q3_000_000","What will you say?"
80,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_A3_000_001","Carrots? Disgusting!"
81,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_A3_000_002","Not particularly."
82,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_A3_000_003","I <Emphasis>love</Emphasis> carrots!"
83,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_022","Really!? Well, no matter. Once you've tasted our carrots, you won't be able to stop eating them. And not simply because of the special herbs they're prepared with!"
84,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_023","Well, I'm sure you'll change your mind once you try one of our carrots of happiness!"
85,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_024","I'm glad to hear it! We need to eat too, though, so try to leave some for us."
86,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_025","I think that covers everything. Thank you for your time!"
87,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_030","That was awfully nice of you taking time to answer our questions. It was more helpful than you know."
88,"TEXT_AKTKZE004_04243_LOPORRITSA04243_000_031","Every word of what you said is here in my notes, and I plan to share it with everyone. Mark my words─we'll transform the moon into a marvel unlike anything you've ever seen!"
