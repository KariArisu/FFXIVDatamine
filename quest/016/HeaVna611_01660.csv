1,"TEXT_HEAVNA611_01660_SEQ_01","Matoya shares with you the tale of her work on a device known as an aetheric converger, and how it led to a bitter falling-out between her and her peers. The fruits of her research were apparently compiled within a tome which now lies sealed within the Great Gubal Library, and you must overcome the dangers within if you wish to retrieve it. Ask Matoya for further instructions."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA611_01660_SEQ_02","Matoya loans you a pair of her servants, one to help you locate the tome within the library, and another to unlock the facility's long-sealed doors. Make yourself known to the latter─a broom."

Upon leaving Matoya's Cave, you are to make your way east; the library building will come into view upon gaining the collapsed bridge. Speak with Broomsy when you arrive, and he will unlock the door for you."

7,"TEXT_HEAVNA611_01660_SEQ_07","Matoya confirms that you have retrieved the correct tome. All that remains is to put the knowledge it contains to use."
