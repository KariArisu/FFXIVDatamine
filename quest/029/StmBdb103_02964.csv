1,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_01","Before unveiling his grand theory, Alphinaud would adjourn to a more appropriate location─specifically, the southern shore of Loch Seld."
2,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_02","After favoring you with a short lecture on the history of Loch Seld, Alphinaud posits that the “darkness beneath the palace” referred to by Ernold may contain the submerged remnants of the ancient city of Skalla. He further theorizes that Theodoric had his kinsmen cursed and cast into the depths not only to punish them for their imagined crimes, but to have them serve as guardians over his treasures. Whilst Alphinaud and Arenvald search for a way into the ruins from above, you are to scour the loch bed for an underwater entrance."
3,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_03","In the frigid waters of Loch Seld, you discover a passage leading directly beneath the palace foundations. Such a find warrants further investigation..."
4,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_04","You have discovered a stone door which appears to offer a way into the ruins beneath the palace. Enter the Drowned City of Skalla, and search for the mad king's trove!

※Challenge the Drowned City of Skalla with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point."
5,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_05","You have defeated the monstrous denizens of Skalla. The fabled treasure must surely lie nearby..."
6,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_06","Having braved the Drowned City's death-filled halls, you finally gaze upon the riches of the mad king's trove. Return to the Ala Mhigan Quarter, and recount the adventure with your comrades."
7,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_07","Alphinaud expresses his admiration for your adventuring prowess, to which he attributes your success in the underground foray. Arenvald, meanwhile, seems more intent on teasing Alphinaud for his reaction to the ruins' ghostly inhabitants..."

50,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ARENVALD_000_011","...In case a rival treasure hunter overhears our plans, you mean? Good thinking!"
51,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_012","That...was not exactly the reason, but 'tis certainly a valid concern. Let us reconvene on the southern edge of Loch Seld."

53,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_020","Forgive me. 'Twas not my intention to draw out proceedings. I simply wished to have the loch in sight while I explained things."
54,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_021","Prior to the great flood of the Sixth Umbral Calamity, the salt lakes you see before you were yet dry ravines. And this, believe it or not, was the site of the ancient city of Skalla, which rose and fell during the Fifth Astral Era."
55,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_022","From what we know of the period, the city was already deserted by the time the waters began to rise, having been all but destroyed by war. Yet its ruins remain to this day at the bottom of Loch Seld."
56,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_023","It is my belief that the “darkness beneath the palace” mentioned by Theodoric's former scribe was not a reference to the prison, but to a place still further below: the ruins of Skalla."
57,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_024","I further surmise that the mad king's unfortunate kinsmen were cast down there not simply out of a desire to punish them, but to discourage exploration. Theodoric wanted to keep the ruins secure..."
58,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ARENVALD_000_025","Wait...you're saying...they were meant to guard the mad king's trove!"
59,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_026","Precisely. And since we know the court thaumaturge was involved, we can safely assume that any entrance into the old city will have been magically concealed."
60,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ARENVALD_000_027","...Which would explain how a legion of imperial soldiers and the gods know how many Ala Mhigans never found a trace of the trove."

While you do that, Arenvald and I will seek out an ensorcelled portal within the palace."
62,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SYSTEM_000_030","You discover a passage that appears to lead under the palace foundations. Press on, and find out where it goes."

We have searched the prison beneath the palace, and found a teleportation portal concealed by enchantments. The markings indicate it leads to an underground cavern."

66,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_042","(-Alphinaud's Voice-)...And you believe it leads into the ruins? Then I daresay we will be able to meet within. Go on and head through the door."

68,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ARENVALD_000_050","Gods, but what a dark and treacherous trek that was, with abominations waiting for us at every turn... In other words, it was a proper adventure!"
69,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_060","Arenvald and I tried to do our fair share, but I fear you ended up bearing the bulk of the burden as usual. You truly led the way with your adventuring prowess, my friend."
70,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ARENVALD_000_061","Aye, without your help, I reckon we'd still be fumbling about in the dark. I'm glad I called on you!"
