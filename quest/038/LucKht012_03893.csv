You had best take up your dragonsung tool right away if you are to present Denys with enough supplies for his goblin team.

※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

Thankfully, she makes short work of applying it, and you are soon the proud─albeit slightly disgusted─owner of an augmented dragonsung tool. Loftier heights await, however, as she and the other Skysteel engineers have more plans in store!"
