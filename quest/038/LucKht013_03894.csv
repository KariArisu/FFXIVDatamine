1,"TEXT_LUCKHT013_03894_SEQ_01","The ever-so-slightly crazed glint in Nimie's eyes suggests that she is perhaps a bit too eager to upgrade your dragonsung tool to yet another level of power and potency. As per the convoluted instructions you have received from the trio of Skysteel engineers, you make a mental note to procure the required materials using the tool in question, trade them to Denys for pot upon pot of even gooier gobbiegoo, then deliver the lot to Nimie along with your tool.

※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHT013_03894_SEQ_02","Thanks to your dedication and devotion─as well as the tireless efforts of your friends at the Skysteel Manufactory, your tool now sings with heretofore-inconceivable power. Taking it in hand with satisfaction, you feel certain that your fellow adventurers who now toil to rebuild Ishgard will likewise revel in the opportunity to wield these marvels of technology and take their already-potent crafting and gathering skills to new heights. You set off with naught left to do but anticipate the day that your mechanically minded friends are able to glean the knowledge and know-how necessary to reach still loftier goals."
