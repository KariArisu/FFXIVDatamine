1,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_SEQ_01","The newly completed Rolling Tankard prototype has been put through its paces, and a lack of screaming and charred earth indicates the final test run was successful. The next step is to produce more tanks, and for that, Ronitt requires a larger workshop. He calls a meeting with the other members of Watts's Anvil, but their talks are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Chief Xamott of the Tholl and Chief Glagg of the Gogg. Quite how these archrivals suffered each other's company long enough to reach Lakeland is unclear, but their ire for Ronitt and Ozogg's disobedience is palpable. Not only have aspiring inventors broken the strict code of their respective tribes, but they have each been accused of perpetrating heinous crimes. Ozogg of sharing Gogg technology with the Tholl, and Ronitt of stealing Watts's designs without permission, an act punishable by banishment. Although Ronitt is able to convince his chief of the importance of the Rolling Tankards, he is given an ultimatum: complete five tanks by the next Beardtide festival or he and the other Tholls will be sent back to Tomra. What's more, he must forfeit Watts's hammer should he fail. Such a grim prospect fails to dampen his determination, and he readily accepts the wager.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_SEQ_02","Ronitt has planned a number of improvements to Watts's Anvil, and he calls on your crafting skills once more. He even has the nerve to demand no less than absolute perfection despite the urgent need to complete the work as quickly as possible."
3,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_SEQ_03","After obtaining the necessary materials from inside the Fetchomatic Mechatoad, you put your mind to the task at hand."
4,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_SEQ_04","Though Ronitt expresses his thanks for your hard work, he is distracted by the absence of Ozogg, who he has not seen since the visit from their respective chiefs. He is perhaps a little too quick to point out his lack of concern for her well-being, stating he simply wishes to know if there is something that might present a problem. As she is unlikely to share her thoughts with a Tholl, he asks that you go and question her in his stead."
5,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_SEQ_05","It seems Ozogg had only gone to survey the proposed site for the upcoming tank demonstration to ensure that nothing will prevent Ronitt from passing Xamott's test. With no prying eyes or ears to hear, she confesses her resolve to never return home, making any punishment from her elders─even the threat of banishment similar to Ronitt─a matter of little concern. All she cares about is carrying on with her engineering, which has been her lifelong passion. She then goes on to share her childhood memories of meeting Ronitt as a boy and their all-too-brief encounter and her giving him a Gogg coin as a token of their friendship. Though Ronitt was too young to remember, Ozogg has fond recollections of that day, and her work at Watts's Anvil reminds her of the simple joy of crafting that she felt all those years ago. Though she insists that she is only here to challenge Ronitt as rightful heir to Watts's hammer, it seems that this may be merely a pretext for her to spend time with like-minded individuals. As you have agreed not to relate her tale to Ronitt and the others, you decide to return to the Anvil and give a condensed and carefully selected account of your talk with Ozogg."
6,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_SEQ_06","Your retelling of the conversation with Ozogg seems to appease Ronitt, whose main concern is whether she will continue to help with construction of the remaining Rolling Tankards. Now that the workshop is equipped for mass production, the dwarves face a race against time to complete the tanks before Beardtide arrives."

133,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_A1_000_002","Wherever these talented hands are needed, I will be there."
134,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_A1_000_003","Because there's money to be made. Presumably."
135,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_OZOGG_000_087","Oh, how very noble! ...I'm being sarcastic, in case you hadn't noticed."
136,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_OZOGG_000_088","Well, if the staggering level of incompetence around Watts's Anvil is anything to go by, those talented hands of yours will find no shortage of work."
137,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_OZOGG_000_089","I wouldn't get your hopes up. Ronitt may be surprised to find there is a lot less demand for his so-called masterpieces than he realizes. Besides, I don't recall him mentioning that <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> would receive any of the profits."
138,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_OZOGG_000_090","We all have our own reasons for being here, I suppose. And it's not like anyone is forcing us to do this. I'm just glad to have someone other than those boorish Tholls to speak to. I mean you, by the way."
139,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_OZOGG_000_091","Honestly, I can't see how they get anything done over in Tomra. Did you see the way Ronitt let their chief talk him into that ridiculous ultimatum?"
140,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_OZOGG_000_092","If they don't get those tanks finished in time, that'll be the end of Watts's Anvil and everything I've worked for will go up in smoke. And worst of all, I'll never get the hammer if Ronitt loses it in this stupid wager!"
141,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_OZOGG_000_093","Luckily, I have a plan, but I'll need some time to mull over the finer points. For now, let's get back to the workshop."

143,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_RONITT_000_096","Hmm... She just went to look over the demonstration site? Seems she wants us to pass Chief Xamott's test, even if it's only for the chance to challenge me for Watts's hammer. Main thing is, she's stickin' around long enough to help with the tanks."
144,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_RONITT_000_097","But enough talk, let's get to work! Because if this doesn't go exactly accordin' to plan, we're done for! Oh gods...I'm not used to this sort of pressure!"
145,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_RONITT_000_100","What do you think of the new, improved workshop? There's no way we can fail now, right? Actually, don't answer that..."
146,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_RONITT_000_101","It won't take us anywhere near as long to build the other four tanks as it did the first, but we still have our work cut out for us. Might have to tell the others no sleep till we're done!"
147,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_RONITT_000_102","And don't go thinkin' that excludes you! I'm expectin' great things from you in the days leadin' up to Beardtide, so no slackin'!"

149,"TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_SYSTEM_000_104","But with the day of reckoning fast approaching, will Ronitt and his comrades be able to complete a column of tanks that meets Chief Xamott's exacting standards?"
