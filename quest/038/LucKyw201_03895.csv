1,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_01","The troops stationed at Porta Praetoria have been given orders to escort you to Alliance Headquarters by Gaius himself, an arrangement that does not sit well with the rank and file. It would appear the investigation into the Empire's Weapon project has finally borne fruit, though you will need to speak with those directly involved to learn more."
2,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_02","Despite having visited Alliance Headquarters on several occasions, your comrades still feel the need to have you escorted there and back each time. The Resistance fighter nearby will be more than happy to show you the way."
3,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_03","You discuss the latest findings of the Ironworks with Severa and Cid, whose earlier hypotheses surrounding the Ruby Weapon have been proven correct. It was equipped with a synthetic auracite system designed to forcibly supplant the consciousness of the pilot with data collected from more experienced soldiers. As Cid explains it, said data was collected via magitek devices akin to soul crystals affixed to the magitek armor of high-ranking officials. This is likely how the Garleans were able to retrieve the combat data of Nael van Darnus, who was killed prior to the Calamity, although there yet remain many questions surrounding the bizarre phenomena witnessed during the battle with the Ruby Weapon. As the Ironworks engineers endeavor to unravel this mystery, you decide to consult with Gaius and plan the next move."
4,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_04","Valdeaulin gives a brief account of his mission to trace the Ruby Weapon's path back to its source. It is believed to have come from an imperial base in Werlyt, which happens to be where Alfonse and the other orphans lived before they were taken into Gaius's care. In addition, a large machina resembling a Weapon was seen being transported to the coastal town of Terncliff a few days past, and the most logical course of action is to disable it as quickly as possible. The considerable distance between the suspected Weapon and your current location poses a major obstacle, but Cid claims to have prepared a top secret plan for such an occasion."
5,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_05","Cid takes great pleasure in revealing his trump card: the G-Warrior, an enormous Allagan warmachina restored to working order. He proposes that it be flown to Terncliff using the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, where it will battle the latest Weapon. It seems you were the only candidate considered as pilot, presumably owing to your preternatural abilities and abundance of combat experience. Gaius, having previously taken helm of the Ultima Weapon, will provide support remotely. Before heading to Terncliff, Cid requests that you familiarize yourself with the G-Warrior's controls using a simulator."
6,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_06","Armed with a fundamental understanding of the G-Warrior, you and your allies make your way by airship to Terncliff, where the Weapon is poised to attack in the bay below. Though your fledgling abilities as a pilot are sorely tested, you eventually succeed in overcoming your foe, which now lies defeated, but largely intact, on the ocean's surface."
7,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_07","After disembarking from the G-Warrior, you join the rest of your party in the now-liberated town of Terncliff. You decide to discuss the aftermath of the battle with Gaius, who may have some fresh insight to share."
8,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_08","The Echo affords you a glimpse of events that unfolded prior to your arrival in Werlyt, and a conversation between Rex and Ricon, two of the orphans fostered by Gaius. With the Eorzean forces on their doorstep, Rex was committed to pilot an as-of-yet-unfinished Sapphire Weapon to afford his comrades time to escape. After much pleading, however, Ricon convinced him to trade places, and instead see the remaining Weapons to a safe location. The vision also confirms the theories surrounding the synthetic auracite and a system known as Oversoul, which fuses the pilot with the Weapon's core and replaces their consciousness with that of another soldier. After expounding on what you saw to Gaius, Cid arrives to confirm the cold, hard truth of your words."
9,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_09","As Gaius is in no state of mind to speak with anybody whatsoever at present, you turn to Valdeaulin, who reveals how he came to travel alongside the former imperial legatus. After his entire village, including his wife and daughter, were captured and used in Garlean experiments on the poisonous gas that would later become Black Rose, he joined the Order of the Twin Adder to exact his revenge. He joined the assault on the Praetorium and was almost crushed as the fortress was brought crashing down, but thereupon encountered Gaius Baelsar, who was close to death. Just as Valdeaulin prepared to land the killing blow, Gaius asked that he stay his hand, at least until he could exterminate the Ascians who had orchestrated the war on Eorzea. Ever since that day, Valdeaulin has followed Gaius on his hunt, that he may judge his true intentions and slay him the moment he breaks their agreement. Valdeaulin seeks to bring a swift end to the threat posed by the Weapon project and return to eliminating the root cause rather than the symptoms of the Ascian menace."
10,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_10","Now that the true nature of Oversoul has come to light, Gaius is more determined than ever to disable the remaining Weapons before they can be deployed. To that end, he and Valdeaulin will pursue Rex and the fleeing Garlean soldiers, while Cid continues to examine the imperial facility at Terncliff and the Sapphire Weapon. Your only task at present is to relay the outcome of the battle to the Resistance members at Porta Praetoria and await further instructions."
11,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_11","You arrive back at Porta Praetoria where the officer in charge offers you a warm welcome. Pleasantries aside, you inform him of all that transpired at Werlyt. There is naught left to do but await further news from headquarters, though you suspect it will not be long before you and your allies are drawn back into conflict with the Empire."

59,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_055","Our early hypotheses were proven correct. The Garleans have designed a system whereby a pilot's consciousness can be forcibly supplanted with data based on the memories and experience of another."
60,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEVERA_000_056","So, even a rank amateur could obtain the combat capabilities of a seasoned warrior?"
61,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_057","Precisely, and we learned how this was made possible when we opened the cockpit. The monitors were still operational, and among the messages displayed, one particular phrase caught my attention: “synthetic auracite system.”"
62,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEVERA_000_058","Which is what, exactly?"
63,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_059","Well, the core of the Ultima Weapon was referred to as the Heart of Sabik by the Ascians. We believe it to have been a type of auracite."
64,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_060","I can't say much for the synthetic sort at this stage, but I've encountered real auracite before. It was extremely potent, perhaps equal in power to the Heart of Sabik."
65,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_061","It's unclear whether the Garleans' simulacrum possesses the same properties as genuine auracite, but I intend to follow this avenue of inquiry to see where it leads."
66,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEVERA_000_062","What we <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> know is that it was used to implant the combat data of Nael van Darnus into the pilot, who has been presumed dead since before the Calamity. Are you any closer to discovering how they were able to retrieve this data?"
67,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_063","The link didn't occur to Gaius at first, but he later told me of devices fitted to the magitek armor of the Empire's high-ranking officers."
68,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_064","There is reason to believe they were designed to emulate the soul crystals used throughout Eorzea."
69,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEVERA_000_065","Yes, that was rumored to be its true purpose, but it was never publicly acknowledged. Perhaps those in the upper echelons of command wanted to avoid comparisons to the so-called “savages” they were meant to be conquering."
70,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_066","There is also the question of whether this system even functions as intended."
71,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_067","From what we've seen, we can assume they were successful in gathering combat data of those wearing armor equipped with the device. If the comparison with soul crystals is valid, perhaps this data was transferred via aether."
72,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_068","However, it seems that it extracted not only memories relating to combat, but the soldier's very essence. As you saw, the pilot succumbed entirely to the will of van Darnus."
73,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_069","Though this is merely supposition, it's possible that being fused with the Ruby Weapon's core accelerated the process and caused the deceased legatus to manifest in corporeal form."
74,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEVERA_000_070","Could it be that the death of the pilot was caused by the system malfunctioning?"
75,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_071","It's hard to say. The Ruby Weapon itself was still largely intact when it deactivated, which strongly implies that it was the synthetic auracite running amok that killed her, rather than the damage incurred during the battle."
76,"TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_072","But even after our analysis, I'm afraid we still don't have enough information. For now, perhaps we should consult with Gaius as to our next plan of action."
