1,"TEXT_BANDWA002_03897_SEQ_01","With the prototype Rolling Tankard nearing completion, it dawns on Ronitt that he has yet to find a suitable fuel to power it, and he gathers his comrades for an exchange of ideas. Their discussion has barely begun when they notice the presence of a mysterious interloper─Ozogg of the Gogg, one of their archrivals. She claims to be descended from Watts, much like Ronitt, to whom she issues a challenge: a test of engineering skill, with rightful claim to Watts's hammer at stake. Ronitt eventually accepts, but on the condition that Ozogg wait until he has finished work on the Rolling Tankard prototype. Having overheard their discussion of fuel, Ozogg offers her village's secret formula to expedite their upcoming showdown, but only if she is supplied with booze beforehand. Much to her dismay, the other dwarves inform her they have no ale to share, nor the means to produce any. Ozogg offers to oversee the construction of a brewery and appoints you as her assistant. Like most present, Ronitt finds this sequence of events absolutely baffling, but if the end result is fuel for his work and workers both, he is all for it.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANDWA002_03897_SEQ_02","Ozogg puts you in charge of crafting some of the basic components for the brewery, the materials for which can apparently be found in Ronitt's automaton."
3,"TEXT_BANDWA002_03897_SEQ_03","Despite Ronitt and his comrades having no intention whatsoever of constructing a brewery, the exact materials needed for essential components have already been gathered by the Fetchomatic Mechatoad. You can only hope that fulfilling Ozogg's order will absolve you of any further involvement in her schemes."
4,"TEXT_BANDWA002_03897_SEQ_04","With the final parts of the brewing apparatus now in place, the dwarves waste no time in producing their first batch of grog and drinking themselves into a stupor. Meanwhile, Ozogg stands back to admire her handiwork."
5,"TEXT_BANDWA002_03897_SEQ_05","Ronitt is eager for Ozogg to keep her part of the bargain and reveal the Gogg fuel formula. She then catches him completely off guard by stating that she has already built a fully functioning ethanol mill to produce the fuel he requires. Ronitt, try as he might, cannot conceal his delight at the latest addition to the facilities and offers Ozogg his thanks, before also thanking you, though far less begrudgingly."
