1,"TEXT_BANDWA003_03898_SEQ_01","The next essential piece of the Rolling Tankard prototype is its cannon, though Ronitt is unsure how best to proceed. He comes to the conclusion that utilizing condensed aether should prove effective in combating sin eaters, although this is a field in which none of the dwarves present have any experience. Regitt recommends seeking the advice of Lorathia, who was once an engineer at the Crystarium.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANDWA003_03898_SEQ_02","Ronitt arrives in Clearmelt to ask Lorathia whether she has any knowledge of aether-based weaponry. Fate conspires once again to bless him with outrageous fortune when Lorathia reveals she is in fact the very person who designed the crystal cannons that line the Crystarium. However, rather than go into any further details regarding this, Lorathia instead invites you to a tea party with her two friends, Iriolva and Cobleva. These elderly twins own merchant caravans that deliver goods across Norvrandt, and they are looking for a way to fend off sin eaters. Lorathia points out that this is an opportunity for Ronitt to secure buyers for his tanks, although his lack of social decorum requires that you be on hand to guide him through this informal exchange. "

5,"TEXT_BANDWA003_03898_SEQ_05","Rosard is eager to support you and Ronitt in your endeavors, and provides you with the blueprints to the Crystarium's crystal cannons.

6,"TEXT_BANDWA003_03898_SEQ_06","Back at Watts's Anvil, Ronitt asks you to craft some of the cannon's components, as described in the blueprints.

7,"TEXT_BANDWA003_03898_SEQ_07","With the necessary materials at your disposal, you are ready to fulfill Ronitt's order. But will your attempt to assist Ronitt end in triumph or bitter failure?"
8,"TEXT_BANDWA003_03898_SEQ_08","Mastery of your craft has ensured you seized victory rather than bitter defeat. As is customary, Ronitt downplays your achievement, though delight is clear on his face. Or would be, if one could see it.
