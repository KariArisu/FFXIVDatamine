20,4,"Well met! I've been dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild to recruit volunteers for special small-scale operations known as guildhests. You look to be of sound mind and body. Might you consider joining?"
21,4,"Wait... Might this be your first time participating in a guildhest? I remember my first hest. It was the night of my twentieth nameday. My fellow guildmates invited me to join them in the slaying of a family of peistes who were stealing chocobo eggs from Bentbranch Meadows."
22,4,"The moment we arrived, one of the terrible beasts immediately turned to me and charged. The thing was thrice my size and had already maimed several chocobokeeps."
23,4,"There was no way I could win, so I simply froze and waited for the end. But that's when I remembered that I was not alone. My friends rallied around me, and together we defeated the peistes! That, my friend, is what a guildhest is truly about."
24,4,"Well met! I've been dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild to recruit volunteers for special small-scale operations known as guildhests."
25,4,"These operations will pit those volunteers against deadly foes, and the odds won't always be in their favor. This is why we require all participants to be of sound mind and body─something that you do not yet appear to be."
26,4,"Time is of the essence. If you have something to ask, make it quick."
27,4,"The operation was a success! Here's your reward, and don't let anyone tell you that you didn't earn it."
28,4,"The operation was a success! Here's your payment, and for your efforts, I've thrown in a little extra, so that you may consider returning to aid us once again."
29,4,"Well, well. It looks like you have a full bag."
30,4,"Can't you see I'm busy attending to your allies? I don't have time to chat."
31,4,"Fall in and make ready!"
40,4,"Greetings, adventurer. I am a battlewarden dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild and tasked with recruiting volunteers to participate in operations known by the quaint moniker, “guildhest.”"
41,4,"As this appears to be your first time joining us, allow me a moment to explain in detail just what exactly a guildhest entails."
42,4,"More than a simple levequest, but not quite as realm-shaking as a Grand Company outing, guildhests will test your ability to work together with a small party of battle companions to overcome not-so-small obstacles."
43,4,"The duty is taxing, but the coin is decent, and you will be helping maintain the safety of Eorzea and the well-being of her citizens. So, what say you?"
44,4,"Greetings, adventurer. I am a battlewarden dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild and tasked with recruiting volunteers to participate in operations known by the quaint moniker, “guildhest.”"
45,4,"I can tell by your garb and gait that the tasks I offer are far beyond a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> of your means. Might I suggest you return once you have honed your skills in the martial or magical arts?"
46,4,"Quickly, adventurer. Every moment spent chatting with me is a moment squandered."
47,4,"Excellent work! Ah, but I suppose you will be wanting your reward now. Very good, then. You have more than earned it."
48,4,"A solid performance. You seem to know your way around the battlefield. Here is to hoping that I may work with you again at a later time."
49,4,"Your bag appears to be quite full. You should consider hiring a retainer."
50,4,"I am attending to your allies at the moment. I will see to you when I have finished."
51,4,"At ease, adventurer. All your allies have yet to arrive."
60,4,"Battlewarden Tiroro Tiro, at your service...or should I say, you'll be at <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> service if you agree to join one of our guildhests."
61,4,"What's a guildhest? Why, it's a be<Emphasis>hest</Emphasis> issued by the Adventurers' <Emphasis>Guild</Emphasis>, savvy? When a certain task brought to the attention of the guild is a little too grand for a leve, but not grand enough for Grand Company involvement, they're deemed guildhests and sent to yours truly."
62,4,"But don't let the lack of grandeur fool you. The tasks are anythin' but simple. Most take place in tight quarters, and <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> require precision teamwork 'twixt you and your battlemates."
63,4,"And so what do you get in return for placing your neck on the loppin' block? Besides a beamin' grin from Battlewarden Tiroro Tiro? Fame, fortune, the usual."
64,4,"Battlewarden Tiroro Tiro, at your service...or should I say, you'll be at <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> service if you agree to join one of our guildhests."
65,4,"But now that I take a closer look at you, I don't reckon you'll be at <Emphasis>anyone's</Emphasis> service till you've bloodied your hands a bit more."
66,4,"I can't think of a single reason why you should be over <Emphasis>here</Emphasis> when the things what need guttin' sit over <Emphasis>there</Emphasis>. Unless that is, you're fixin' to bolt."
67,4,"Bloody hells, that was brilliant! I never tire of watchin' me a good broil, especially when it's down and dirty. Here's your coin, just as promised."
68,4,"Hah hah hah! A fine display for a first-timer. Here's your well-earned coin. I've tossed in a little somethin' extra to sweeten the deal, so's that you might consider comin' back."
69,4,"I cannot well fit your reward into that pack. She's burstin' at the seams!"
70,4,"Wait the queue with the rest o' your battlemates, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. There's only one of me, despite the demand."
71,4,"The operation will begin when your party is complete."
80,4,"Shkoh! Shkoh! Gobbieflock in danger! Uplanders take gatekey! Open Headgate!"
81,4,"Twist gatekey! Open Headgate with much fastness!"

100,4,"My name is Sidonia. I am a battlewarden with the Adventurers' Guild tasked with the distribution and evaluation of guildhests originating here in Coerthas."
101,4,"As it is your first time to participate in a guildhest, allow me a moment to explain the particulars."
102,4,"I suppose you are wondering what exactly a guildhest is. The answer to that is simple. A guildhest is a task assigned to small parties of able adventurers, usually to rid the realm of some imminent threat."
103,4,"The tasks, however, are anything but simple. They will require not only battle prowess, but the ability to work with others, conceive and execute complex strategies, and finally adapt those strategies when conditions change...and they always do."
104,4,"My name is Sidonia. I am a battlewarden with the Adventurers' Guild tasked with the distribution and evaluation of guildhests originating here in Coerthas."
105,4,"It is clear that you have journeyed far to come here, and for that I commend you. However, the Adventurers' Guild is in need of someone with experience...something it is also clear you lack."
106,4,"Why is it you stand here speaking with me while the enemy beyond lurks still?"
107,4,"I conclude that hest objectives have been completed to the satisfaction of the guild, and therefore hereby present you with your reward."
108,4,"Your performance is deserving of a reward beyond that which was promised in the original accord."
109,4,"You carry quite the burden with you, adventurer. I do not believe the reward I have prepared will fit in that bag of yours."
110,4,"Might I ask you to wait until I have finished serving your companions?"
111,4,"Patience, adventurer. There will be time for killing soon enough."
120,4,"Archimbalt Two Trees, battlewarden with the Adventurers' Guild, at your service, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>good lady<Else/>good sir</If>."
121,4,"I, myself, was once an adventurer, just as you. The Age of Calm had given rise to the guilds, and there was much work to be had. Work like these guildhests, though they were simply called behests back then."
122,4,"Now, here I am. Twenty and five summers since I first picked up a blade, guiding a new generation into the jaws of battle."
123,4,"If it is blood and glory you seek; if it is fighting shoulder to shoulder with trusted companions to overcome impossible odds that gives your life meaning; and if you wish to do all this and line your pockets with gil while you're at it, then you need look no further!"
124,4,"Archimbalt Two Trees, battlewarden with the Adventurers' Guild, at your service, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>good lady<Else/>good sir</If>."
125,4,"I have seen my share of battles in the twenty and five summers since I took up a sword and slew my first wharf rat. That is why I can tell if a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> is ready for the trials that lie before <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>. You, I can tell, would not stand a chance against the tasks I offer."
126,4,"There will be time for reliving past battles after the battles have passed. The outcome of this one is still to be decided... That is, unless..."
127,4,"I could not have done better myself! I know... I tried and was knocked cold for three nights."
128,4,"There is more to you and your companions than meets the eye. I sense great things from you, and I would know, a veteran of some twenty and five summers."
129,4,"Ah, a bag bursting with the spoils of war. When I was an adventurer, I, too, would constantly find myself pressed into the difficult decision of what to discard so that I might claim my reward."
130,4,"Eager to collect your reward and move on to the next battle? I understand. That fire once burned hot in me, as well. But for the meantime, I must ask you to wait your turn."
131,4,"The thrill of battle have you <If(PlayerParameter(4))>in its grasp<Else/>by the stones</If>, has it? Aye, but in times as this, all one can do is relax and ready oneself for the coming rush. Your companions will arrive when they arrive."
132,4,"Your skills are beyond doubt, adventurers. Keep your wits about you, and you may yet go far. On to the next stage!"
133,4,"That was a most impressive showing. The third and final stage awaits you!"
134,4,"It begins! Gird your loins!"
135,4,"Contests pitting man against cyclops have ever drawn large crowds...and spilled copious amounts of blood!"
136,4,"Amazing! But few can claim to have bested Pyracmon!"
137,4,"One look from the catoblepas can freeze a man's blood in his veins. Ware its accursed gaze!"
138,4,"Wh-What's this? The catoblepas was as a docile lamb before you!"
139,4,"You've surpassed all my expectations, but the final test is yet to come. Prepare to face the elite among elite!"
140,4,"By the gods, that was a contest for the ages! 'Twas all I could do to refrain from joining the fray!"
141,4,"Proceed to the second stage?"
142,4,"Proceed to the third stage?"
143,4,"I welcome you to Neverreap, brave netherling. Take thunder eggs in hand. Place thunder eggs on an altar of the clouds, and winds will swirl and carry you deeper into Neverreap. But be warned, for there great dangers await."
144,4,"Prepared to start then, are ye?"
145,4,"Here's yer bonus for completin' the exercise! Remember this trainin' on the field o' battle!"
146,4,"You are prepared to commence training, then?"
147,4,"Your preparations are complete, then?"
148,4,"Oi! We're in the middle o' trainin'!
...Had enough already, have ye?"
149,4,"The exercise is not yet done!
...But mayhap you are done with the exercise?"
150,4,"I cannot help you during the exercise!
Unless you simply wish to quit...?"
151,4,"Here is your prize for completing the exercise. But remember: the real prize is the lesson you've learned!"
152,4,"That's all for now! I hope this lesson will serve you well in your adventures!"
153,4,"Begin the training exercise?"
154,4,"Exit the training exercise?"
155,4,"Congratulations on completin' me course, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>! Here's a little somethin' to mark the occasion!"
156,4,"You've proven yourself a novice no longer! Pray accept this prize to commemorate your achievement!"
157,4,"I knew you were ready for the challenge! Here. I bestow this gift upon all who complete my training course!"
158,4,"Outstandin'! Learnin' to avoid the obvious attacks is a skill all adventurers need!"
159,4,"Those who insist on standin' still won't long survive the profession!"
160,4,"Nicely done! Learning to avoid the obvious attacks is a skill all adventurers need!"
161,4,"Those who insist on standing still won't long survive the profession!"
162,4,"Good show! Learning to avoid the obvious attacks is a skill all adventurers need!"
163,4,"Those who insist on standing still won't long survive the profession!"
164,4,"Use that combination in battle, an' ye'll build all the enmity ye need."
165,4,"When faced with a single foe, it's the simple methods that're often the most effective!"
166,4,"As ye've seen, combinations're a fine way o' buildin' enmity."
167,4,"When a party is relyin' on ye to take the hits, ye need a reliable method for grabbin' the enemy's attention!"
168,4,"When facin' multiple foes, it's all about positionin'!"
169,4,"Do ye see how fightin' a group calls for a different technique?"
170,4,"If ye want to be at yer most effective, ye need to switch yer tactics to meet the situation!"
171,4,"Ye see how easy it was to split up that big, nasty mob?"
172,4,"The situation don't always allow it, but often there's a better strategy than “charge!”"
173,4,"Roundin' up reinforcements ain't so hard, eh?"
174,4,"Did you mark the sturdiness of your ally taking the enemy's hits?"
175,4,"Coordinating efforts with a heavily armored defender will allow you to fight to your fullest!"
176,4,"Coordination is the key to conquering foes swiftly and safely!"
177,4,"Work well with your allies, and the efficacy of your armor need not be tested!"
178,4,"Neatly done! Breaking off attacks to save your skin is always the wisest course!"
179,4,"Though it may sometimes be a frustrating dance, it is better to dodge than be sprawled in the dust!"
180,4,"A fine performance! A party is doomed without a source of restoration."
181,4,"When reinforcements threaten your healer, it is time to spring into action!"
182,4,"It is imperative to recognize when a battle has turned against you."
183,4,"Act quickly to neutralize an enemy's advantage, or be prepared to suffer through a difficult fight!"
184,4,"Well done! A focused healer is a boon to any party!"
185,4,"Even when it's safe to attack, always keep one eye on your allies' health!"
186,4,"Spreading one's heals amongst many can be a trying task."
187,4,"To succeed in your role, however, you must learn to quickly assess who is most in need of mending!"
188,4,"Nice footwork! Be wary of those foes cunning enough to target the source of healing!"
189,4,"And speakin' o' survival, perfectin' each o' me lessons will earn ye a piece o' armor to help ye in yer chosen role. Ye can also repeat this same lesson with the other masters, an' be rewarded with equipment what works best for students o' their combat style."
190,4,"And speaking of survival, perfecting each of my lessons will earn you a piece of armor to aid you in your chosen role. Should you feel so inclined, repeat this same lesson with the other masters that they might reward you with equipment tailored towards their fields of expertise."
191,4,"And speaking of survival, perfecting each of my lessons will earn you a piece of equipment to aid you in your chosen role. Should you decide you'd like to have a more versatile wardrobe, simply repeat this same lesson with the other masters to receive armor suited to their specialities."
192,4,"As House Haillenarte's lead pilot, I've been entrusted with overseeing operations across the Diadem─guiding your explorations and arranging rewards and such. Suffice it to say, you'll be hearing from me rather a lot!"
193,4,"Let's see what you have, shall we?"
194,4,"Aye, that's everything we need for the now. House Haillenarte thanks you!"
195,4,"Your explorations provide us with invaluable insight into the Diadem's unique wildlife and resources. Once we've learned how to best harness the isles' riches, our investment will surely be repaid many times over!"
196,4,"Here's the elixir our alchemists have concocted. Time to see how well it works."
