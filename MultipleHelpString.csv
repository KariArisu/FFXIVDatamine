7,"Reward Restrictions","Players will not earn rewards for completing phases they have already completed.

Coffer and reward quantity will vary based on the total number of party members who have already completed the duty.
　・0 players = 1 coffer 
　・1-4 players = 1 coffer (Reduced reward quantity)
　・5 or more = No coffers
 
When participating in the latest Savage raid with a matched party, duty rewards may change based on the progress level of matched members."
8,"Job Distribution","Parties formed with the Raid Finder do not allow for two members with the same job unless certain conditions are met.
　・DPS jobs are divided into the following roles:
    Melee DPS, Physical Ranged DPS, Magical Ranged DPS, and Not Specified.

When the raid purpose is set as “Duty Completion,” the jobs that fall into Not Specified must be different from the ones which fill the other three DPS roles. When the raid purpose is set to “Practice,” overlapping between specified and unspecified DPS jobs is allowed.

Parties formed with the Raid Finder do not allow for more than one pure healer and one barrier healer.
　・Pure Healers: White Mage, Astrologian
　※Emphasis on actions that directly heal self and party members.
　・Barrier Healers: Scholar, Sage
　※Emphasis on actions that negate damage via magicked barriers."
9,"Party Progress","A party's starting point in the duty is determined by the leader's past progress. As long as all other conditions are met, players who have not progressed as far as the leader may still participate in the duty.

If a party member's progress was less than that of the leader, then progress will be updated to match.
If a party member's progress is beyond that of the leader, that member's progress will remain unaffected.
