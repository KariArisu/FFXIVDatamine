The following pages contain a detailed explanation of what you may expect on the battlefield.<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

2,86801,"<UIForeground>08</UIForeground><UIGlow>04</UIGlow>■Level Sync<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

Though it is possible to join the Bozjan southern front beginning at level 71, all players will be synced to level 80 while in duty. Item level will also be synced accordingly.

<UIForeground>0F</UIForeground>* All job actions unlocked through level 80 will also be available while in duty.<UIForeground>01</UIForeground>"
3,86802,"<UIForeground>08</UIForeground><UIGlow>04</UIGlow>■Resistance Rank<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

All players are subject to a separate leveling system while at the front, indicated by their “Resistance rank.” Performing admirably in large-scale battles such as skirmishes and critical engagements will increase your “mettle”─akin to experience points.

<UIForeground>0F</UIForeground>* Simply defeating imperial troops and beasts is not enough to prove your mettle─you must participate in successful military operations.<UIForeground>01</UIForeground>"
4,86802,"If you demonstrate sufficient mettle upon reporting to the Resistance commander, your Resistance rank will climb. Those of higher rank will gain access to more areas of the front, as well as additional quests.

<UIForeground>0F</UIForeground>* Your Resistance rank will not increase unless authorized by the commander, so don't forget to report for inspection!<UIForeground>01</UIForeground>"
5,86802,"<UIForeground>08</UIForeground><UIGlow>04</UIGlow>■Job Leveling<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>

Upon successful completion of a military operation, you will gain regular experience points in addition to mettle. This experience will be applied to your job level as normal, so it is recommended that you consider using a job that has not yet reached level 80 to take advantage of experience point gains."
