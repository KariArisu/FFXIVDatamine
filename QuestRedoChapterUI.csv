67,66103,5,25,1,113861,113661,113761,"Pugilist","","Pugilism can be traced back to bare-handed battles in the Coliseum, and a legendary brawler whose unrivaled strength and skill inspired the founding of the Pugilists' Guild. It is there that you begin your training under Hamon Holyfist, a legend in his own right, but a shocking revelation threatens to shake the guild to its very foundation."
68,65975,5,26,2,113862,113662,113762,"Lancer","","Though spears and lances have existed long before Gridania's founding, the art of their use evolved rapidly with the establishment of the Lancers' Guild. Within its halls, and under the instruction of Guildmaster Ywain, you endeavor to master the weapon, and by contending with a rogue lancer do you learn the true meaning of courage."
69,65691,5,27,3,113863,113663,113763,"Rogue","","The Dutiful Sisters of the Edelweiss. A seemingly innocent convent that, in truth, is the base of operations for the Rogues' Guild, the collective of men and women who work from the shadows to preserve peace in Limsa Lominsa. Here you learn the tricks of the trade under the watchful eye of Guildmaster Jacke, and discover the dark underbelly of La Noscea."
70,65612,5,28,4,113864,113664,113764,"Archer","","A fusion of styles from Elezen and Miqo'te archery gave rise to the bowmanship boasted by the Archers' Guild of Gridania, and it is there you train to sharpen your eye under the guidance of Luciane, master of the guild. Though but a fledgling archer, your skills with a bow are soon put to the test when outlaws threaten the sanctity of the Twelveswood."
71,65889,5,29,5,113865,113665,113765,"Thaumaturge","","The funeral rites of the Order of Nald'thal have been focused and refined into what is known today as thaumaturgy, and the five brothers who lead the Thaumaturges' Guild have elected to offer you instruction in the dark art. The arrival of the sixth brother, however, serves to complicate your training."
