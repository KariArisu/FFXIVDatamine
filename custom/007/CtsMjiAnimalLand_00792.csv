8,"TEXT_CTSMJIANIMALLAND_00792_BOKUCHIKU_015_005","That's why I've prepared some small nets for you here, which'll let you catch smaller critters. A word of advice: be gentle with the animals out there, and they'll treat you the same in return."
9,"TEXT_CTSMJIANIMALLAND_00792_BOKUCHIKU_015_010","Before you go, if you have any questions concerning the pasture, I'm always here to answer them. If I've learned one thing during my brief time in this world, it's that you should never be embarrassed to ask questions, friend. Never."

35,"TEXT_CTSMJIANIMALLAND_00792_BOKUCHIKU_200_000","Recently, my team and I got to thinking. It'd be nice to have a bigger pasture. With a larger home for the animals, they'd have more space to graze, and there'd be more capacity too. Most of all, I think we'd all have bigger smiles."
36,"TEXT_CTSMJIANIMALLAND_00792_BOKUCHIKU_200_005","All done! Go ahead and capture some more animals, if you like. Seeing them grazing here peacefully really soothes my mammet heart."
37,"TEXT_CTSMJIANIMALLAND_00792_BOKUCHIKU_300_000","Hello, friend. So wouldn't you know, my team and I got to thinking again. What if we made the pasture even bigger? Then even more animals could graze in it, and we could all have even bigger smiles. What do you say?"
38,"TEXT_CTSMJIANIMALLAND_00792_BOKUCHIKU_300_005","What a day. What a day indeed. One of the animals seemed to think my legs would look good in its stomach, so we had an impromptu play session. I tried to scold it, but I didn't have a leg to stand on. Anyhow, our work on the pasture's all done. See for yourself."
39,"TEXT_CTSMJIANIMALLAND_00792_BOKUCHIKU_300_010","Given how large the pasture's become, I reckon it'd be mighty difficult─mayhaps even stressful─for you to take care of each animal individually. With the amount of field hands I have on my team now, I think we can help. We'll just need a set of mammet-sized pastureworker's tools."
