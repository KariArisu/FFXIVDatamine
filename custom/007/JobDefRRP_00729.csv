1,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_A1_000_001","How fare the Lemures?"
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_A1_000_002","Can you tell me about reapers again?"
4,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_010","We're doin' as well as can be expected, all things considered. Arnegis left some shoes that're provin' hard to fill, and we've found ourselves with less gil at hand than we're accustomed to."
6,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_011","Hermin is doin' all she can, bless her heart. As much as she claims to hate usin' her head, she's shown a sharp mind for trade, and thanks to her our ceruleum business is gettin' back on track."
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_012","Arnegis's wife is makin' do, you'll be glad to hear. She's runnin' her own stall and doin' a fine job at it by all accounts. I just hope that if anyone in the family needs my help, I'll be around to give them what they need."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_013","I've heard tell of what happened in Garlemald. Just because the Empire is gone, it doesn't mean that everyone who's fled its clutches has a burnin' desire to return home. I take it the Lemures will be in Ul'dah for some time yet."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_020","A lot to take in, ain't it? As we've discussed, reapin' was passed down from my Garlean forebears in Locus Amoenus. A humble people who spent their days farmin', they were driven by invaders to an inhospitable waste...where they turned their tools to weapons."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_021","But it ain't our scythes that people speak of in hushed whispers─it's our avatars. Through them do we receive a small measure of a voidsent's fathomless power, givin' us abilities that'd make even the most learned mages green with envy."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_022","Of course, not everyone is able to bind themselves to the void, even if they're willin'. It takes a certain kind of person─a certain kind of <Emphasis>soul</Emphasis>─to resonate so deeply with a voidsent. One that thrives in the darkness as well as it flourishes in the light."
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_023","That's what I was referrin' to when I said you had the “killer instinct.” It's a rare sort of connection to the Thirteenth─much to Hermin's displeasure. For days she sat in front of one of those crystals, but heard not so much as a murmur from the other side. She was crestfallen, as you can imagine."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_024","Those Garleans who are fortunate─although some might argue on that point─enough to be courted by the void are given gifts that nature has denied them. They're able to drink their fill of the world's aether, and much more besides."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_025","For centuries my forebears were tied to the void, and we used the strength it gave us to defend hearth and home."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_026","When invaders would threaten our borders, we'd be the ones to cut down their leaders. Under the cover of night we would strike, just another shadow cast by the embers of dyin' campfires. When the sun rose, only the dead would serve as trace of our presence."
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_027","Our enemies feared us, though they knew not what we were. Until the reign of Emperor Solus, that is. Now, when people think of the Empire, they think of magitek─that inexorable wave of hulkin' metal which few can withstand."
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_030","I've gotten so used to seein' the scythe strapped to your back, I nearly forgot what you looked like without it. Not as fierce, maybe, but you strike an impressive figure regardless."
