1,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_000","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Allow me to thank you personally for your contribution to our research. Your stories of the ancients' creations have planted the seeds of a great many theories, and I cannot wait for them to flourish!"
2,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_A1_000_003","How goes the investigation?"
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_A1_000_004","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_100","Professor Claudien has asked me to write detailed records of your investigation. If you wouldn't mind staying for a while, I would ask you to tell me more of your adventures in the past."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_101","Adventures that started with that mysterious crystal, seemingly containing a message declaring a crisis in this “Pandæmonium”... Of course, Professor Claudien will eventually make a report, but we are deficient on concrete facts at present."
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_102","To that end, I suppose a comprehensive catalog of the beasts you encountered in the “Asphodelos” circles would be a fine starting point. Yes...I require every gory detail, every hair-raising description!"
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_103","Nemjiji! I've brought the volumes you asked for, but...are you quite certain we need all of this just to research the crystals?"
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_104","Some of these─<Emphasis>Habitats of Aquatic Life-forms</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>Myths and Folklore of the Phoenix</Emphasis>, for example─seem to have little bearing on the subject. In fact, many of these tomes seem to be related to the creatures of Pandæmonium <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> spoke of..."
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_105","Surely we have better things to do with our time! <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> has already encountered and subdued them, so what use could further insight offer? "
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_106","On the contrary, Ruissenaud, we would be remiss in our duty as academics <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> to take every opportunity to learn more of these subjects. To view the creatures of bygone times through the lens of modern science is a dream so few have the chance to achieve!"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_107","Of course, I'll not deny a personal interest in the matter."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_108","Hmph─as I thought. While there were enough relevant volumes for me to fulfill your request this once, if you wish to sate your appetite for knowledge again, might you do so on your own time?"
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_110","Ahem, shall we proceed? Tell me everything you remember. And please, spare not a single detail─I don't easily frighten, you may be assured."
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_111","We might start with your battle with this transformed warder─Erichthonios, was it? I would also like to hear of the keyward and the nature of his metamorphosis."
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_112","Good, good. Thank you for this priceless information. While I'm disappointed I couldn't behold your foes with my own eyes, your stories have given me more than enough to write sufficiently lurid─I mean, thorough─descriptions."
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_113","Perhaps we should also include basic theories concerning the growth and behavior of these creatures. It would give our little catalog some flavor, wouldn't you agree?"
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_114","We could start with... Ah, I have it! Aquatic life-forms in our time have been observed to grow to sizes that are orders of magnitude larger than their larval forms."
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_115","In fact, it may not be so preposterous to posit that the hippokampos you encountered was merely the larval form of a much more massive─and dare I say, horrific─entity!"
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_116","Now, don't look at me like I'm some mad magus. Breakthroughs have been precipitated by even wilder theories than that. As the professor always says─we mustn't let logic stand in the way of brilliance!"
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_117","Until proven one way or the other, every hypothesis is a valid one. Ah, there is nothing quite like the ambrosia of inspiration!"
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_Q1_100_100","What will you say?"
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_A1_100_100","Are we making records or creating faerie tales?"
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_A2_100_100","Your ideas are intriguing to me..."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_120","So long as I make a note in the margins of my records indicating that a theory is unproven, we can let our imaginations run wild! Yes, I said <Emphasis>our</Emphasis>─you needn't be a researcher to have an idea that will leave its mark for generations!"
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_400","By Professor Claudien's order, our reports to the other research bodies have been somewhat scarce on concrete information."
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_401","Even if we wanted to go into further detail, there are too many unknown variables concerning how this crisis might affect our present..."
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_402","We only know for certain that the crystal we found ties us to the past. We've had no luck eliciting further memories from its depths."
29,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_403","We're at present gathering as many soul crystals and shards as we can to conduct thorough comparisons, but those experiments have yet to bear fruit."
30,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_404","Of course, the fact that none but you can hear our enigma's voice to begin with puts something of a damper on our potential progress. Yet even so, Professor Claudien is doing all within his power to move things forward!"
