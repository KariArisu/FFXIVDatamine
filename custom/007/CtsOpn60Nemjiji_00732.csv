Your stories of the ancients' creations have planted the seeds of a great many theories, and I cannot wait for them to flourish!"
2,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_005","There is sure to be an archive in Elpis simply brimming with useful information. And since every researcher worth his salt knows that knowledge is the better part of the battle, I suggest scouring every corner before returning to Pandæmonium."
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_010","We will be awaiting your return with bated breath. I only hope we can remain focused on our own tasks among all the excitement."

5,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_020","I shall do as Master Fourchenault commanded and compile our research before sending it before the Forum. Paperwork of all manner has been my forte since before I was even a student."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_030","I am poring over every fragment and document we have concerning the aetherial sea. If we discover aught that might be of use, rest assured you shall be the first to know."
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_035","It seems that once again we have you to thank for this much needed respite. With Professor Claudien back safe and sound, we can begin making steps toward a return to normalcy."
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_040","With matters settled and memories of events still fresh in my mind, I think soon I'll begin the recordkeeping process. This time I saw everything with my own eyes─a perspective which will be of great use when I sit down to write my stor─ Ehem, when I sit down to write my <Emphasis>reports</Emphasis>. "
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_050","The more I try to make sense of what happened, the more my mind ties itself in knots. It will take weeks─or dare I say months─to navigate this maze of questions. I may have to suggest that Professor Claudien hire more assistants..."

13,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_100","Professor Claudien has asked me to write detailed records of your investigation. If you wouldn't mind staying for a while, I would ask you to tell me more of your adventures in the past."

15,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_102","To that end, I suppose a comprehensive catalog of the beasts you encountered in the “Asphodelos” circles would be a fine starting point. Yes...I require every gory detail, every hair-raising description!"
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_103","Nemjiji! I've brought the volumes you asked for, but...are you quite certain we need all of this just to research the crystals?"

18,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_105","Surely we have better things to do with our time! <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> has already encountered and subdued them, so what use could further insight offer? "
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_106","On the contrary, Ruissenaud, we would be remiss in our duty as academics <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> to take every opportunity to learn more of these subjects.

20,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_107","Of course, I'll not deny a personal interest in the matter."
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_108","Hmph─as I thought. While there were enough relevant volumes for me to fulfill your request this once, if you wish to sate your appetite for knowledge again, might you do so on your own time?"
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_110","Ahem, shall we proceed? Tell me everything you remember. And please, spare not a single detail─I don't easily frighten, you may be assured."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_111","We might start with your battle with this transformed warder─Erichthonios, was it? I would also like to hear of the keyward and the nature of his metamorphosis."
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_112","Good, good. Thank you for this priceless information. While I'm disappointed I couldn't behold your foes with my own eyes, your stories have given me more than enough to write sufficiently lurid─I mean, thorough─descriptions."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_113","Perhaps we should also include basic theories concerning the growth and behavior of these creatures. It would give our little catalog some flavor, wouldn't you agree?"
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_114","We could start with... Ah, I have it! Aquatic life-forms in our time have been observed to grow to sizes that are orders of magnitude larger than their larval forms."
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_115","In fact, it may not be so preposterous to posit that the hippokampos you encountered was merely the larval form of a much more massive─and dare I say, horrific─entity!"
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_116","Now, don't look at me like I'm some mad magus. Breakthroughs have been precipitated by even wilder theories than that. As the professor always says─we mustn't let logic stand in the way of brilliance!"
29,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_117","Until proven one way or the other, every hypothesis is a valid one. Ah, there is nothing quite like the ambrosia of inspiration!"
30,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_Q1_100_100","What will you say?"
31,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_A1_100_100","Are we making records or creating faerie tales?"
32,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_A2_100_100","Your ideas are intriguing to me..."
33,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_120","So long as I make a note in the margins of my records indicating that a theory is unproven, we can let our imaginations run wild! Yes, I said <Emphasis>our</Emphasis>─you needn't be a researcher to have an idea that will leave its mark for generations!"
34,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_140","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, may I have a moment? If you would be so inclined, I would very much like to hear the story of your battles in Abyssos and Tartaros."
35,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_141","While I have no difficulty producing reports for the Forum with a general summation of events, I could use some help with the finer details. For the record, you know."
36,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_143","For the record, you say? Come now, be honest and admit it's to sate your own curiosity. I've seen the tomes you've left scattered about the laboratory─bestiaries of creatures both real and imagined."
37,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_144","I will not─and I daresay, should not─deny an intellectual stake in the matter. But surely <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> will understand that a thorough recounting will help Professor Claudien's research as well. Now then, whenever you're ready."
38,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_145","...Fascinating. As you say, the savage creation you encountered in Abyssos bears more than a few similarities to the Carbuncle. Could it be that the arcane entities we know now had their origins in ancient times?"
39,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_146","Just as curious was your story of the keyward who was melded with a tree of legend... Where do the limits of the hemitheos creation process lie, I wonder? And how do such creatures even survive, once melded?"
40,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_148","As expected, you cannot help yourself from asking ever more questions─what purpose would such knowledge serve?"
41,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_149","Oh, Ruissenaud, one day you too shall develop the keen instincts of a researcher. Then you shall understand that it is impossible not to wonder, once the spark of imagination has been struck!"
42,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_150","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s stories have already set several theories stirring in my mind, and I feel even more bubbling just under the surface."
43,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_100_150","Take Hephaistos for example. It would not be a great leap to assume that he studied at length the regenerative and death-defying properties of the Phoenix. And that is just the tip of the proverbial berg!"
44,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_RUISSENAUD_000_151","You are free to exercise your imagination all you like, but─need I remind you─these reports are meant to be submitted to Master Fourchenault himself. I implore you to exercise restraint."
45,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_152","...Professor Claudien would have encouraged me, you know."
46,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_153","He thrives on theories and imagination. But I do understand your point, Ruissenaud─if I were to submit such a report to Master Fourchenault, I would soon thereafter be forced to write a formal apology."
47,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_Q1_100_200","What will you say?"
48,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_A1_100_200","Fourchenault is more open to wild theories than you think."
49,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_A2_100_200","He doesn't look like someone you'd want to make mad."
50,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_155","That very well may be! An academic does not achieve the station he has without a curiosity as deep as the aetherial sea itself."
51,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_160","I was hoping you would be more supportive, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>... Very well, I shall include only conjecture that is directly relevant to the contents of the report."
52,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_165","Now I should set ink to paper, and let the wonder of theory guide my hand. Within reason, of course."
53,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_166","Yet I cannot help but dream ever larger─there are no bounds to what the mind can imagine! And if there are, let us both strive to find them, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! "
54,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_200","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, may I have a moment of your time? I would very much like to hear of the battles you fought within the Pandæmonium that appeared in our age."
55,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_201","While I was fortunate enough to witness most events with my own eyes, I was not there to write down a blow-by-blow account. Your testimony would be a welcome and flavorful addition to my records."
56,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_202","...To think your foes would be even more fantastic than the ones you faced in the past. Truly, not even my wildest imaginings could come close to what reality gave us."
57,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_203","I'm particularly fascinated by Athena, and cannot help but wonder what she would have become if left to her devices. We were terribly close to finding out, and doubtless it would have been one of the last revelations of our lives. "
58,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_204","But she may not have gone so far if not for the auracite, which magnified her desires to an almost incomprehensible degree. Just how it could influence one so is a matter well beyond the ken of modern scholarship."
59,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_205","I believe you saw how twisted those under its sway can become when you faced the Lucavi. Just what designs did Ultima, the High Seraph have in bestowing the “gift” of auracite to those poor souls?"
60,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_210","I will admit, it makes me rethink the numerous stories and legends which feature mysterious crystals at their core. Some of them tell of tragic figures who, much like Athena, were transformed."
61,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_215","If Athena had achieved her dream of godhood, she may very well have been able to bend even auracite to her will. And soon the world would have followed suit!"
62,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_216","What a chilling end to my story...and, er, a fascinating theory to add to my report, of course. I must scour our documents for any supporting evidence!"
63,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_CLAUDIEN_000_217","(-???-)...Ah, now I understand why you sent Ruissenaud to fetch any scrap containing even a hint of crystalline machinations."

65,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_CLAUDIEN_000_219","I had noticed that important tasks were being left neglected, and when I inquired as to the reason, poor Ruissenaud explained that he could barely keep up with your requests. Something must be done about this new obsession of yours..."
66,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_CLAUDIEN_000_220","...You must pursue it until you find the answers you seek! I believe you are on your way to a discovery that shall make you the envy of your peers─myself included!"
67,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_CLAUDIEN_000_221","We often find breakthroughs only after shattering the rules of conventional research. I shall tend to Ruissenaud's tasks, but you must promise me that your report will be a thing of wonder!"
68,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_222","...Of course, Professor, you have my word!"
69,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_223","I shall give every scenario a fair shake─where evidence is lacking, imagination shall fill in the gaps. I shall blend the lines between fantasy and science so skillfully that you will doubt if they were ever there at all!"
70,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_CLAUDIEN_000_224","I would expect no less from one of my assistants. Before you put pen to parchment, I would be honored if you shared some of your idle musings with me."

77,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_404","Of course, the fact that none but you can hear our enigma's voice to begin with puts something of a damper on our potential progress. Yet even so, Professor Claudien is doing all within his power to move things forward!"
78,"TEXT_CTSOPN60NEMJIJI_00732_NEMJIJI_000_410","With the professor absent, there is little for us to do besides organize our papers and keep the laboratory clean. I suppose it could be worse..."
