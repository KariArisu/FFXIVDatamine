Have you ever heard such unfounded nonsense? The vast tapestry of stars in the skies above are teeming with life, and I shall prove it if it's the last thing I do!"

You, and only you, can establish the verisimilitude of my brilliant theories...so do listen closely as I describe my hypotheses to you in unmitigated detail."
