7,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF2_00730_LALAHJINJAHL_000_020","All is well thanks to you and your invaluable aid. Guildivain has been sent back to Sharlayan, where he will be tried by the Forum, and I've no doubt but that he will get his just deserts."

Ancel tends to lose a little too much inhibition and occasionally has to be restrained by the proprietor. In other words, they are like any other group of young folk, and it warms my heart to see this."

16,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF2_00730_LALAHJINJAHL_000_035","While nouliths are far more sophisticated, the basic principle remains unchanged. Wielding them as an extension of <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> mind, a sage sends them darting through the air to unleash <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> magicks."
