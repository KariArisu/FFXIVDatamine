1,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_A1_000_001","How fare you of late?"
2,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_A1_000_002","How fares the Ilsabard contingent?"
3,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_A1_000_003","Nothing."
4,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_000","Nothing is more important to a pugilist than stamina. And how does one attain such a thing? By eating well, sleeping well, and training well!"
5,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_010","The path of the pugilist is paved in punishing practices, in exercises that fortify not only the body, but the mind as well. Arduous? Yes. But together, we will reach the end of this long, challenging road."
6,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_020","The Pugilists' Guild has seen a great influx of members as of late. I assume you've something to do with that? "
7,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_021","As for myself, well, time is hardly on my side. Every day is a blur of new recruits and all the training that entails. Though once I've whipped them into shape, I think I might travel a bit."
8,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_022","I've still so much to see of the world, so much more yet to learn. The experience I gained with the contingent feels almost wasted here. But out there in the wider world, it could be of real use to people. I could offer help to those in need!"
9,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_023","Oh, but don't mention this to anyone else, I beg you. I haven't told a soul yet. After all, I wouldn't dare leave the guild now, not when things are still so hectic."
10,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_100","Yes, the contingent is still taking up an ample amount of my time, but I must see to the guild's needs, too, whenever I am able."
11,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_101","I confess, I saw myself in a different, not-entirely-flattering light next to all those great warriors. I felt entirely unblooded, undertrained in every aspect...though I'm determined for that to no longer be the case. I will grow stronger─as strong as those I fought alongside."
12,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_110","What a journey it's been, I must say. After we parted with you and yours at the Enceladeum, we had ourselves a scuffle with some of the tempered."
13,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_111","But I must say, you were incredible out there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I always knew there was something about you─something special─but seeing it up close and personal like that... Goodness! You truly are the hope of the people."
14,"TEXT_REGWIL5CHUCHUTO_00770_CHUCHUTO_000_112","When I thought I was done for─ When it felt as if I couldn't take a single step more, I could hear your voice telling me to get back up, to fight to the bitter end. You saw me through my darkest moments by giving me hope and courage when I needed it most, and for that I thank you."
