1,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_010","Feel that balmy breeze in the air, friend? Another lovely summer is upon us, and that means it's time to celebrate the Moonfire Faire! Should you have any questions as to how best to enjoy the festivities, you need only say the word!"
2,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
3,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_A1_000_001","What is the Moonfire Faire?"
4,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_A1_000_002","What is the Eorzean Warrior Nimble course?"
5,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_A1_000_005","Nothing."
6,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_020","Several years ago, the Adventurers' Guild formed the Cascadiers to combat an invasion of rampaging Bombards. The Moonfire Faire was first held to attract new members to the cause."
7,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_021","It proved so popular that it has been held annually ever since, whether the Bombards appear or not. It helps spread word of the guild's activities and generate interest among potential new recruits. In charge of the proceedings is the grand chaperone, Haermaga."
8,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_022","He has decided to have members of the Adventurers' Guild demonstrate their courage and physical prowess to faire-goers through a series of challenges in Costa del Sol."
9,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_030","Master Gegeruju has once again provided the space and funding for the event. It's sure to be the most spectacular Moonfire Faire held to date!"
10,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_031","Since you're here, why not join in the festivities?"
11,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_032","The event is being held even as we speak, courtesy of the ever-generous Master Gegeruju. Your participation would be most appreciated!"
12,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_040","The Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, which made its long-awaited return this year, is an obstacle course that tests the physical limits of those brave enough to face it. But the course did not return unchanged─nay, it has been reborn, with a new circuit for all to enjoy!"
13,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_041","You must be wondering, “if the course was so popular, why didn't you bring it back sooner?” Constructing the course is no cheap endeavor, and it may not've returned at all had Master Gegeruju not learned of the sweltering demand for it─we owe its reconstruction this year to his considerable financial backing."
14,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_042","Now, should you be interested in giving the course a whirl, I'd be remiss if I didn't warn you of how demanding it is. To reach the end, you must overcome obstacle after obstacle, leaping between foothold and platform alike by jumping at just the right angles─or risk plunging to the depths below."
15,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_043","And while it's not <Emphasis>quite</Emphasis> as physically taxing, the newly added circuit is most certainly not for the faint of heart. With an array of bombs before you threatening to explode at any moment, you must remain calm in the face of danger in order to reach the goal at the end."
16,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_044","Both the original course and the new circuit offer a challenge worthy of the Eorzean Nimble Warrior name─and overcoming challenges is what an adventurer does best, is it not? I, along with my Faire colleagues, look forward to seeing how you fare!"
