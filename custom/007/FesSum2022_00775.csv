3,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_A1_000_001","What is the Moonfire Faire?"
4,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_A1_000_002","What is the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course?"
5,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_A1_000_005","Nothing."
6,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_020","Several years ago, the Adventurers' Guild formed the Cascadiers to combat an invasion of rampaging Bombards. The Moonfire Faire was first held to attract new members to the cause."
7,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_021","It proved so popular that it has been held annually ever since, whether the Bombards appear or not. It helps spread word of the guild's activities and generate interest among potential new recruits. In charge of the proceedings is the grand chaperone, Haermaga."
8,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_022","He has decided to have members of the Adventurers' Guild demonstrate their courage and physical prowess to faire-goers through a series of challenges in Costa del Sol."
9,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_030","Master Gegeruju has once again provided the space and funding for the event. It's sure to be the most spectacular Moonfire Faire held to date!"
10,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_031","Since you're here, why not join in the festivities?"
11,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_032","The event is being held even as we speak, courtesy of the ever-generous Master Gegeruju. Your participation would be most appreciated!"
12,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_040","Why, it's the grandest obstacle course ever made! With a new circuit in tow after its long-awaited return this year, adventurers like yourself may test not only your physical limits, but now the extent of your courage too!"
13,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_041","Assembling such a structure is no cheap endeavor, however, which is why we were forced to put the course on hiatus. It may never have returned at all if not for Master Gegeruju's benevolence. We owe its reconstruction to his considerable financial backing."
14,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_042","Now, should you be interested in undertaking the original course, be warned that you must leap across countless footholds and platforms alike with exacting precision, or risk plunging to the depths below."
15,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_043","And, while the new circuit may not be physically challenging, it is most certainly not for the faint of heart. With an array of bombs before you threatening to explode at any moment, you must remain calm in the face of danger if you hope to reach the end."
16,"TEXT_FESSUM2022_00775_ETHELIA_000_044","Both the original course and the new circuit offer a challenge worthy of the Eorzean Nimble Warrior name─a challenge all willing adventurers are encouraged to brave. I look forward to seeing how you fare!"
