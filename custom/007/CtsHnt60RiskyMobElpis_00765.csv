It has been my life's work to scrutinize the myths of peoples across the land and throughout the ages, trying to glimpse the truth that hides behind commonalities these timeless stories share."

As one of the foremost scholars in the field of comparative mythology, I have tasked the gleaners' guildship with procuring samples to prove my theory that the creatures described in myth are, in fact, quite real.

Bismarck, the white whale worshipped by the Vanu Vanu and said to dwell amongst Abalathia's clouds, is merely the best-known example."
12,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBELPIS_00765_BASILDERE_000_011","Perchance such tales originated solely in the mind─ancient peoples shuddering at the sight of a vast wavekin, and imagining what horrors would reign should one take to the skies. Or perhaps, in the distant past, a creature akin to the mythic Lord of the Mists truly did inhabit the clouds..."
13,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBELPIS_00765_BASILDERE_000_012","I believe it so─yet I need proof. My research indicates that the ancient creature would most closely resemble the south sea isles' legendary “Shockmaw,” but even if I am wrong...I must know."
14,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBELPIS_00765_BASILDERE_000_020","Ah, this one is most intriguing. There is a myth passed down in the far west─in the land known as the New World─that tells of a deity named Yumcax, believed to rule over agriculture."
15,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBELPIS_00765_BASILDERE_000_021","In this legend, Yumcax is described as an enormous tree that not only levitates, but is also possessed of a singular eye. Though there are certain similarities with the species of seedkin we know as treants, the differences are too marked to ignore."
16,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBELPIS_00765_BASILDERE_000_022","In the interest of respecting your time, I shall get right to the point─I believe Yumcax once existed, in a time before memory. Even should it be a mere twig or scrap of bark, I am counting on you to procure a sample that proves my theory."

As a matter of fact, a creature with the selfsame description appears in Nymian mythology─a creature known as the “petalodus.” I always found it an amusing thought, though of course the notion of a shark with ambulatory limbs beggars belief."

What matters is that I believe this to be more than a mere cautionary tale about the danger of crocodiles to their immediate community. Its inspiration must have been found in reality, and we are going to prove it!"

Amongst these commonalities, one in particular has fascinated me─the multi-headed snake or dragon. "
