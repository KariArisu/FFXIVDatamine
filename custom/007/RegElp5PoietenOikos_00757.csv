8,"TEXT_REGELP5POIETENOIKOS_00757_ERATO_000_021","You might be wondering what the name of the place itself means, to which I say─many things! However, “home of those who've a way with words” is likely the easiest for you to understand. We taxonomists express ourselves through nomenclature, after all."
