Well, I will anyway. Before we get started, I want to make it very clear that while you may be the owner, I command the mammets, and as such I demand a considerable sum. I would hate for us to get off on the wrong foot."

4,"TEXT_CTSMJIMISSION_00791_NEKOMIMI_002_005","Now, while it has much potential, this clearing is currently as bare as a white baboon's buttocks. We'll need some form of shelter from the elements if we're to truly make something of the place."

22,"TEXT_CTSMJIMISSION_00791_NEKOMIMI_003_015","The brilliance of the hatchet's design─a design of my own making, mind you─is that even a non-mammet like yourself can craft it with your own two non-mammet hands. Isn't that wonderful?"

32,"TEXT_CTSMJIMISSION_00791_NEKOMIMI_004_015","That hatchet of yours should be able to cut through even the thick bark of a palm tree. Meaning you can now collect palm logs, a material vital to our soon-to-be-built haven."
