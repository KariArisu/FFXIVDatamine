They're not for me, mind you─I need the funds to hire a team. Some mammets want to be paid for their work, but me? The thrill is payment enough."
3,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_SYSTEM_110_000","Spend <Format(IntegerParameter(1),FF022C)/> seafarer's cowries to clear the land?"

12,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU3_120_003","What a travesty. Just look at it. A bunch of sediment, in our very own home. I can get rid of it for you. We can build a path, maybe─find a place for more buildings. But I'll need the right set of tools...and a team."
13,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU4_120_004","<whistle> We've got ourselves one nasty briar patch here. Thorny enough to scratch off my whiskers, I'd wager. I can cut it up nice and good, but you know the drill. I need the proper tools, and the cowries to hire a team."
14,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU5_120_005","Look at all these big, ugly rocks. Wouldn't you like me to smash them? I'd love to smash them for you. Just give me the tools. And a bunch of mammets."
15,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_200_000","This is strictly between you and me, but if you have an island of your own and need someone to break things, I can introduce you to some mammets."
16,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_021_000","Ah, you must be the owner. Our felicitous friend told me today is the day I can finally do the job I was created to do. Will you let me do that job?"
17,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_SYSTEM_021_000","Expand Home Sweet Hideaway?"
18,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_Q1_021_000","Cut away this vexatious vegetation!"

21,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_021_010","Oh... Okay. No, that's fine. That's perfectly all right. It's not like I was looking forward to this or anything."
22,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_022_000","And that's how you do it. Good-bye irksome trees and plants, hello vegetationless land. If you like what you saw today, I'm always happy to do more. I'll just need the shells to get the necessary help."
23,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_022_005","You can use these two plots to build a workshop, or at least that's what the furball told me to say. You can leave it as is or play around in it for all I care."
24,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_022_010","If you <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> decide to build a workshop, you'll be needing plenty of limestone. And you'll break your hatchet if you try to chop a rock with it, so you should probably make a hammer. There's nothing better than a hammer for smashing things! "
25,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_022_015","As for the materials you'll need to build the workshop... Beats me. The felicitous furball said something about writing them all on the logboards, though."
26,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_022_020","Oh. I suppose there's enough space for you to release your minions now, but I can't see why you'd want to do that. Are we, your loyal, hardworking mammets, not enough for you? Because by releasing them, you're saying we're not enough for you. "
27,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_SYSTEM_022_000","The islekeep's stone hammer recipe has been added to the sanctuary crafting log. Crafting this new tool will allow you to gather various stones from rocks by smashing them."

30,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_SYSTEM_022_015","New plots of land are now available. Further expansion appears possible, but you will need a sizable amount of seafarer's cowries to cover the necessary expenses."
31,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_023_000","The hammer? Check your crafting log, you just need to follow the instructions."
32,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_024_000","The materials necessary to build the workshop should be written on the logboards. Unless the furball was lying. Which seems more likely than not."
33,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_025_000","I see you've built a workshop. Shame, I liked how the place looked before. Anyway, I suppose you can have a team of mammets craft stuff now."
34,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_025_005","If you have them sell the items they craft, it should become a valuable source of seafarer's cowries...cowries which you can then give to myself and other like-minded models so we can keep doing what we do best."
35,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_KAITAKU1_025_010","Oh, and before I forget, don't expect any buildings to be constructed as quickly as this one going forward. The team worked extra hard since there were no functioning facilities to speak of, but now that there are, there's hardly any rush."
36,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_SYSTEM_025_000","The workshop is now available. Speak with the tactful taskmaster near the cozy cabin to set up a production schedule."
37,"TEXT_CTSMJIVILLAGEDEVELOPMENT_00782_SYSTEM_025_005","Constructing a building will now require a set amount of hours (Earth time) to pass before it is fully constructed."
