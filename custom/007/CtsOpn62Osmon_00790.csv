1,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_000","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, how fare your adventures? You, uh, wouldn't happen to have any you'd like to share, would you?"
2,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_Q1_100_000","What will you talk about?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_A1_100_001","Nothing."
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_002","Nothing worth sharing right now? Oh! Does this mean you're putting together a carefully curated account of exciting exploits to regale me with later!? I can hardly wait to hear it!"
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_100_002","<sigh> I need a new novel to read that's truly...novel."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_003","The Sil'dihn Subterrane? I am passing familiar with its history."
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_004","And Mistress Momodi's client had you exploring this network of tunnels and aqueducts?"
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_005","Fascinating! By your description, this mysterious gate's floral motif sounds very much like a gerbera─or daisy, as some prefer to call it."
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_006","Shallow Moor is our resident botanical expert, so I can only tell you what she's told me; that gerberas are a common sight in Ul'dah, having adapted to thrive in Thanalan's arid climate. I've also read that the Royal House of Thorne had something of a special relationship with these blooms."
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_007","And was it not during the Thorne Dynasty that the Sil'dihn waterways were purged of zombies?"
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_008","Curious... The Thornes' shadow flickers, ever present, at the edges of your tale. I understand you are not at liberty to tell me everything, but even the abridged account has been absolutely captivating!"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_009","A sealed gate. The hidden paths which lie beyond. The kind of perilous locales a poor combatant such as myself would read about but never hope, or wish, to visit."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_010","Deep beneath Ul'dah do mighty guardians dwell, but what have they been placed to protect...? It practically bleeds intrigue!"
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_011","Yes, I'm ready to write my adventure epic, and it will be set in the dank passageways of the Sil'dihn Subterrane!"
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_012","...But let me think a moment. Anything lurking in moldy aqueducts for an extended length of time would surely deteriorate as rust or decay set in."
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_013","Putting aside the question of how long they've been down there, is it not reasonable to expect the inhabitants were once far stronger...?"
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_014","...Perhaps strong enough to challenge even the indomitable <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, eh? With you as my muse, this book will all but write itself!"
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_015","So inspired was I by the retelling of your subterranean adventure, that I snatched up a quill and penned an entire draft in one sitting!"
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_016","Picture labyrinthine tunnels winding beneath Ul'dah's golden streets; fearsome foes aplenty to menace our courageous hero!"
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_017","A daring desert saga, packed with action from cover to cover!"
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_018","I wonder, would you do me the honor of being the first to read it? After all, your expert opinion is the only one I care to hear!"
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_SYSTEM_000_019","Though you only intended to skim a few pages, Osmon's surprisingly well-crafted story draws you in with its evocative descriptions and breathtaking pace..."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_020","Mount Rokkon? The name rings familiar... It is home to a place known as Shojo Temple, is it not?"
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_021","So the rumors were true! A few of my fellow gleaners have mentioned it before. Unfortunately, such mentions tend to be paired with a copious helping of complaints."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_022","In the past, the guildship would often assign gleaners to Kugane, that we might locate and collect valuable Far Eastern antiques. Yet our every attempt to purchase these items ended in failure, for an unknown buyer outbid us at every turn."
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_023","Baffled by this buyer's seemingly bottomless coinpurse, the gleaners conducted an investigation of their own, and eventually discovered their rival's identity: Shojo Temple's head monk. To my knowledge, Shallow Moor has not had the displeasure of bidding against the man... Perhaps that is best."
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_024","Your missive was from the East Aldenard Trading Company, yes? Were you privy to some manner of dealings with the head monk?"
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_025","To think such a fate could befall the temple... I am passing familiar with the concept of tsukumogami, but I had not realized that the myths surrounding them would bleed into reality."
29,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_026","Having been a place of worship for much of its history, the mountain and its surrounding environs were likely rich in aether."
30,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_027","And if such is the case, those so-called accursed treasures were not unlike kindling to a burgeoning flame... A shame indeed that the whole mountain had to suffer for one man's avarice."
31,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_028","But this tragic tale <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> be told in writing! I can almost picture it─the lush greenery, the silence of the mountain marred by the unholy sight of demons... Yes, it's all coming together!"
32,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_029","Now, if memory serves, tsukumogami manifest themselves with a singular purpose in mind. Yet as their long-awaited goals slowly come to fruition, their power begins to wane. Not ideal for stirring hearts and raising the literary stakes, if I'm to be honest."
33,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_030","But what if, like the great auspices, their power grew over the centuries?"
34,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_031","Why, they would be more fearsome than one could imagine─more terrifying than the horrors you have faced! A conflict that grand would be a most splendid thread for the tale I plan to weave..."
35,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_035","So taken was I with your adventures in the Far East, that I could not help but pen down the whole manuscript!"
36,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_036","Ahem! “On the venerable slopes of Mount Rokkon, a demonic threat rises... Shojo Temple's once-immaculate walls are stained with the blood of the pious. Yet against the crowds of fleeing monks and pilgrims, a hero walks on, undeterred, unyielding...”"
37,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_037","A gripping start, is it not? I daresay this draft may well be the next Tale of Tenzen!"
38,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_038","I don't suppose you'd want to give it a read, would you? The tale is yours, after all, and I would not wish to do your heroic depiction any injustice."
39,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_SYSTEM_000_039","Though you only intended to skim a few pages, you are immediately captivated by Osmon's riveting prose. His astonishing depictions of your encounters with the mononoke leave you craving a battle of equally grand proportions..."
40,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_040","I am told you paid a visit to the south sea isles, yes?"
41,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_041","Good, good! The isles are of great interest to us gleaners. Ancestral home of the Plainsfolk, and birthplace of arcanima."
42,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_042","It's also been speculated that some of its inhabitants emigrated from the ancient city of Nym. Alas, the records supporting this are fragmentary and in poor condition besides. Needless to say, no two scholars in the Studium can agree as to their veracity."
43,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_043","With so much history packed into such a remote locale, you can understand why I would hang on every word of your account. You <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> share it with me, won't you?"
44,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_044","Aloalo... Where a forgotten people once made their home, and where scant traces of their legacy remain..."
45,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_045","In hearing of this Speaker and its shrine, I am reminded of a merchant from whom I procured tomes of arcanima, and a particular tale he had to tell."
46,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_046","You know of Mealvaan's Gate in Limsa Lominsa, yes? Its establishment was proposed by Ikuku Iku, advisor to the Admiral and arcanist from the south sea isles."
47,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_047","Rumor had it that her island was home to a statue of tremendous power, and through her people's efforts to decipher the statue's secrets, the art of arcanima was born."
48,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_048","It takes no prodigious leap of logic to conclude that Ikuku Iku must have hailed from Aloalo."
49,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_049","And the first settlers─they must have commanded powerful magicks indeed. Magicks unlike any we know today, which were lost to history when their wielders vanished."
50,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_050","Had the ancient arts survived intact and been refined further by successive generations, what impossible wonders might have been wrought upon the island..."
51,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_051","Imagine the beasts you encountered in your expedition, but with their ferocity multiplied manifold! Ahh, 'tis on these flights of fancy that our minds may soar to inconceivable heights!"
52,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_055","So taken was I with your account of Aloalo that, as if in the grip of a fever dream, I composed a new manuscript in a flash! Allow me to offer you a taste..."
53,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_056","“Among the remote south sea isles is a singular place known as Aloalo, whose beauty is rivaled only by the savagery of the beasts which prowl its shores. Into the deadly wilds a dauntless adventurer must journey in search of secrets long forgotten...”"
54,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_057","A tale of high adventure, engrossing mysteries, and thrilling battles, set in a tropical paradise!"
55,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_058","You must promise to read it. As my primary inspiration, your feedback would prove invaluable."
56,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_SYSTEM_000_059","Though you only intended to skim a few pages, you find yourself enchanted by Osmon's tale. His grandiose descriptions and extreme embellishments are so engaging that you soon realize your own recollection of Aloalo is being colored by his fiction..."
