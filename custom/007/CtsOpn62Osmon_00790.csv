1,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_000","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, how fare your adventures? You, uh, wouldn't happen to have any you'd like to share, would you?"
2,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_Q1_100_000","What will you talk about?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_A1_100_001","Nothing."
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_002","Nothing worth sharing right now? Oh! Does this mean you're putting together a carefully curated account of exciting exploits to regale me with later!? I can hardly wait to hear it!"
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_100_002","<sigh> I need a new novel to read that's truly...novel."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_003","The Sil'dihn Subterrane? I am passing familiar with its history."
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_004","And Mistress Momodi's client had you exploring this network of tunnels and aqueducts?"
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_005","Fascinating! By your description, this mysterious gate's floral motif sounds very much like a gerbera─or daisy, as some prefer to call it."
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_006","Shallow Moor is our resident botanical expert, so I can only tell you what she's told me; that gerberas are a common sight in Ul'dah, having adapted to thrive in Thanalan's arid climate. I've also read that the Royal House of Thorne had something of a special relationship with these blooms."
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_007","And was it not during the Thorne Dynasty that the Sil'dihn waterways were purged of zombies?"
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_008","Curious... The Thornes' shadow flickers, ever present, at the edges of your tale. I understand you are not at liberty to tell me everything, but even the abridged account has been absolutely captivating!"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_009","A sealed gate. The hidden paths which lie beyond. The kind of perilous locales a poor combatant such as myself would read about but never hope, or wish, to visit."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_010","Deep beneath Ul'dah do mighty guardians dwell, but what have they been placed to protect...? It practically bleeds intrigue!"
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_011","Yes, I'm ready to write my adventure epic, and it will be set in the dank passageways of the Sil'dihn Subterrane!"
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_012","...But let me think a moment. Anything lurking in moldy aqueducts for an extended length of time would surely deteriorate as rust or decay set in."
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_013","Putting aside the question of how long they've been down there, is it not reasonable to expect the inhabitants were once far stronger...?"
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_014","...Perhaps strong enough to challenge even the indomitable <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, eh? With you as my muse, this book will all but write itself!"
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_015","So inspired was I by the retelling of your subterranean adventure, that I snatched up a quill and penned an entire draft in one sitting!"
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_016","Picture labyrinthine tunnels winding beneath Ul'dah's golden streets; fearsome foes aplenty to menace our courageous hero!"
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_017","A daring desert saga, packed with action from cover to cover!"
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_018","I wonder, would you do me the honor of being the first to read it? After all, your expert opinion is the only one I care to hear!"
