1,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_002","O-Oh, it's you! I would be ever so grateful if we could beg the aid of the gleaners' finest in fulfilling our research requests, so please don't hesitate to ask about any of the elite specimens of Labyrinthos."
2,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
3,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_A1_000_001","Tell me about the rank B elite mark. (Ü-u-ü-u)"
4,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_A1_000_002","Tell me about the rank B elite mark. (Green Archon)"
5,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_A1_000_003","Tell me about the rank A elite mark. (Hulder)"
6,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_A1_000_004","Tell me about the rank A elite mark. (Storsie)"
7,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_A1_000_005","Tell me about the rank S elite mark. (Burfurlur the Canny)"
8,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_A1_000_006","Nothing."
9,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_010","As you may already be aware, there is research being performed on animal husbandry in Labyrinthos. One subject of that research is the Azim Steppe's species of yakow, the dzo. The Xaela keep them as livestock, so we hope to find some success in maintaining them as a food source."
10,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_011","Alas, one of our dzo recently sent for slaughter managed to escape before it could be delivered, and is now...well, running amok, so to speak."
11,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_012","The dzo responds to “ü-u-ü-u”─which is, in fact, a herding call employed by the Xaela, though no few gleaners have mistaken it for a personal name. Should you find this difficult to pronounce correctly, however, more rudimentary methods of quelling the beast will suffice."
12,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_020","Are you familiar with a species of seedkin called the “genomos”? Yes, well, while their resemblance to topiary does render them absolutely adorable, they are also quite carnivorous."
13,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_021","Genomoi typically prey upon small animals that draw near them for shade. Alas, a particular specimen has grown enormous with its insatiable appetite, and mice and the like do naught to satisfy its hunger."
14,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_022","We have termed this specimen the “green Archon” in hopes that the name will give unwary scholars pause ere approaching, but I fear that their desire to study it will soon outweigh their sense of self-preservation..."
15,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_030","Though built from an enormous natural cavern, Labyrinthos nevertheless required extensive development of the surrounding terrain. In the process of excavating layer upon layer of land, an unusual seed specimen was discovered. Unearthed after millennia..."
16,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_031","Sharlayan's researchers, naturally, planted it in fertile soil and watered away. Lo and behold, it sprouted right before their eyes! They were positively overjoyed."
17,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_032","Alas, their joy soon turned to terror when the fully grown specimen began to sing a most bewitching song. A full day passed before the researchers were able to cease dancing hysterically and term her “hulder,” after beings from local folklore."
18,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_040","The Central Circuit─the deepest layer of Labyrinthos─houses facilities called “elemental reactors,” which are used to adjust its climate."
19,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_041","Recently, a pair of trolls have been causing mischief around one such facility, each trick less amusing than the last. Indeed, for reasons known to none but themselves, the two even captured a small serpent they found amidst their trolling, and hurled it into the elemental reactor!"
20,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_042","A few weeks passed before the serpent slithered out of the facility─unharmed, but no longer small. Nay, after absorbing an exorbitant amount of aqueous aether from the reactor, our little Storsie had grown to an enormous size and developed a ferocious nature."
21,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_050","The massive trolls you find throughout Labyrinthos have long inhabited the wilder parts of the Northern Empty. They were taken from their natural habitat to act as apex predators in Labyrinthos, and are absolutely essential in maintaining its ecosystem."
22,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_051","The ones that do not attack people, at any rate... Which brings us to Burfurlur, the wizened leader of a veritable horde of his kin. As for his appellation─he's remarkably quick-witted for his kind, and has even managed to craft armor and weaponry from tree bark."
23,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_052","Naturally, Burfurlur has been classified as an essential specimen for ongoing research into the intelligence of trolls as a species, but this is somewhat difficult to accomplish whilst he's still roaming free, taking bites out of researchers."
24,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBLABYRINTHOS_00761_EDITHE_000_053","It will be no simple matter to draw out such a cunning mark without raising suspicion, but observation from afar has shown that he tends to let his guard down at the sight of younglings at play on a pleasant day..."
