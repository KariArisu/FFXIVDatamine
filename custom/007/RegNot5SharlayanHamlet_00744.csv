1,"TEXT_REGNOT5SHARLAYANHAMLET_00744_SYRENEAD_000_001","I heard all about your exploits with the Loporrits, and the assistance you provided my colleagues. Very impressive! Perhaps I might avail myself of your services, too, should ever the need arise."

9,"TEXT_REGNOT5SHARLAYANHAMLET_00744_SYRENEAD_000_011","It has been my home since I joined in the construction of the ark many moons ago. I've only seen the true sun a handful of times in the past few years, if you can believe that."

11,"TEXT_REGNOT5SHARLAYANHAMLET_00744_SYRENEAD_000_021","A great many of us─if not all of us─are engaged in projects of a highly classified nature. In order to maintain that level of secrecy, none here are allowed to leave Labyrinthos, unless you've permission to do so."
12,"TEXT_REGNOT5SHARLAYANHAMLET_00744_SYRENEAD_000_022","It has been goodness knows how many years since last I left, myself. Considering the importance of my work, however, I am perfectly content right where I am. Just between the two of us, though, I do miss the ocean. Just a little."

We are no longer under lock and key, as it were."
