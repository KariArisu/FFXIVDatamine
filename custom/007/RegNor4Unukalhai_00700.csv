1,"TEXT_REGNOR4UNUKALHAI_00700_UNUKALHAI_000_020","What? With our methods, we can barely maintain a faint connection to the Thirteenth...but you say that you've journeyed there!? Incredible..."
2,"TEXT_REGNOR4UNUKALHAI_00700_UNUKALHAI_000_021","Such drive Archon Y'shtola must have to uncover the secrets of cross-rift travel. And to conceive of creating an artificial Atomos could only be described as inspired."
3,"TEXT_REGNOR4UNUKALHAI_00700_UNUKALHAI_000_022","Suffice it to say, I should like nothing more than to join you on your future forays, but I will abide in patience for now. You already have a capable guide at your disposal, and my presence would be extraneous."
