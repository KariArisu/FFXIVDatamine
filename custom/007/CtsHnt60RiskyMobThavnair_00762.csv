1,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_002","I appreciate your willingness to speak with me. I would be more than happy to provide you with information on the specimens we've requested from Thavnair and Garlemald, if you have the time."
2,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"

13,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_010","Ah yes, Iravati. The name is a rather ancient word for a medicinal plant─or so my colleagues among the Arkasodara say."
14,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_011","Evidently, this particular specimen grew inordinately powerful after menacing several alchemists and subsequently downing half the Great Work's supply of potions and elixirs."
15,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_012","The professors of the Studium's Faculty of Medicine were ecstatic to hear of this, and have requested samples to facilitate the study of the effect alchemical potations have on animals. Alas, for various reasons, few are willing to contend with a rampaging gaja."
16,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_020","Thavnair is home to a plethora of rare and unusual fauna, but there is perhaps none so unique as the vajralangula. These creatures use their tails to pluck fruit and wave it about as a means to court mates."
17,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_021","Said three-pronged tail clasped about an amra bears a mighty resemblance to the vajra─a weapon oft depicted alongside local divinities─hence the species's name."
18,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_022","Our naturalists would like to study the aforementioned tail, and require a specimen in its youthful prime as a sample. Naturally, they've gone and set their hearts on a particularly ornery one, and naught else will do..."
19,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_030","Sugriva once led a pack of wolves in the north of Thavnair, within the dense jungle of Vanaspati. By all accounts, he is a truly enormous specimen."
20,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_031","Nevertheless, the previous alpha returned to reclaim his pack and successfully ousted Sugriva, who migrated south. He now wreaks havoc in his exile, and the people want for someone willing to slay the beast."
21,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_032","Fortunately, a professor of biology filed a request for a vibrant pelt the other day, and Sugriva happens to fit the bill. For once, the faculty's timing couldn't be more perfect!"
22,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_040","The Au Ra's flavor of Hannish once used the word “yilan” to mean “snake,” though I fear that fails to capture the─frankly repulsive─image of what the Faculty of Medicine has requested you hunt down."
23,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_041","According to reports from the local naturalists, the creature emits aether from its photophores that crushes its prey into a more diminutive form, the better to swallow it whole. Not pleasant, oh no."
24,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_042","Nor is it technically a serpent. Rather, 'tis a quadrupedal scalekin that is equally dangerous on land and in water─though at least it's not subtle."
25,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_050","It goes without saying that pisaca are the apex predators of Thavnair. With their elongated, whip-like tongues, these scalekin abominations make prey of even men."
26,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_051","Worse yet, the pisaca has an additional weapon at its disposal─nigh-impenetrable scales partially composed of metal─that has garnered the interest of the Faculty of Engineering. You can imagine where this is going, but for the sake of thoroughness..."
27,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_052","Our engineers have requested the scales of a particularly large pisaca for one of their projects. Though the creature was rather euphemistically named for quartz, “sphatika,” I fear that obtaining its hide will require courage of adamant."
28,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_053","Sphatika is known to mercilessly attack any rivals that would encroach upon its territory, and many a hunter has become the hunted in its domain. Perhaps these are merely rumors...but I suggest you don't count on it."
29,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_Q3_000_000","What will you ask?"

36,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_060","A massive morbol from Dalmasca, the Emperor's rose was originally presented in offering to Solus zos Galvus. Subsequently, it was kept in a greenhouse located in the imperial botanical gardens."
37,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_061","The creature escaped its enclosure some few years ago, and made its way to the frigid Eblan Rime, where the Garleans believed it had perished. Thus it was with great surprise that they discovered the creature had not only adapted to the extreme cold, but begun to propagate itself."
38,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_062","One of our biology professors is perplexed by how this seedkin, born in the hot and humid climate of a jungle, managed to adapt to the polar opposite so swiftly. Much to our collective dismay, there is only one means by which to find out..."
39,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_070","Ah yes, the warmonger... Developed at the Enceladeum, this autonomous, cutting-edge piece of magitek is programmed to ruthlessly slaughter whosoever it determines to be “the enemy.” As you may have guessed from its name, it is not particularly discriminating in said determination."
40,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_071","Nevertheless, the Garleans are one or two steps ahead of Sharlayan when it comes to mechanical engineering, so faculty and students both are champing at the bit to study it."
41,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_072","Given its nature as an unfeeling machine of mass murder, it would be difficult and likely unwise to retrieve in an operational state. However, should it be appropriately dismantled, its parts ought to be sufficiently edifying."
42,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_080","Though researchers in Labyrinthos have pioneered technology capable of controlling the local climate, such control requires an immense amount of variously aspected aether to maintain."
43,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_081","We must find a means to guarantee healthy crops without such technology, in even the most extreme of climes. The capability to do so is vital in cultivating untamed reaches─but also for ensuring stability for already established populaces."
44,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_082","Thus did the Studium's biologists set their sights on Aegeiros, with bark so resistant to cold that it thrives in the most frigid of climes. Admittedly, harvesting a bit of bark would require no great expertise...if our subject weren't known to prey on great bears and the like."
45,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_090","The Studium's engineers are currently developing a machine capable of operating in freezing temperatures, and have requested the procurement of a certain warmachina to aid in their project─Minerva."
46,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_091","Don't be fooled by the familiar name─this is a cold and unfeeling magitek avenger prototype that we are discussing. From what I understand, the machine was affectionately named after its creator's daughter."
47,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_092","Which gives rise to the question─what kind of parent gives a magitek weapon modeled after the sasquatch the same name as their daughter!? Perhaps there is some manner of Garlean tradition here to which I am not privy...but I daresay dismantling the thing would be doing the poor child a favor."
48,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_100","The Enceladeum is─er, <Emphasis>was</Emphasis>─the Garlean Empire's greatest magitek manufactory. Many an innovation in engineering technology developed within its intimidating halls."
49,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_101","Most recently, its engineers were focused on the development of humanoid machina. One of their latest models, dubbed “Armstrong,” was designed with a self-regulation system never before seen in the Empire's machina."
50,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_102","Unlike your standard machina, which require mission parameters and combat protocols be programmed in advance, Armstrong is highly autonomous─and indeed has been described as having “a mind of its own.” If it sights allied troops in danger, for example, it will rush to support them."
51,"TEXT_CTSHNT60RISKYMOBTHAVNAIR_00762_LUBDAHRM_000_103","With Garlemald in its current state, however, who knows what it's getting up to? The Faculty of Engineering certainly doesn't, but is nonetheless determined to find out what makes Armstrong tick...which is, of course, where you come in."
