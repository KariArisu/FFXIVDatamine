2,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_Q1_000_001","What will you talk about?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_MINSTREL_MENU_CANCEL","Take your leave."
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_MINSTREL_NOSELECT_000","Oh, leaving so soon? I would be lying were I to say I wasn't disappointed, but I appreciate that a hero such as you has great demands upon <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> time. I shall look forward to hearing your adventures when you have a spare moment."
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_MINSTREL_NOCONTENT_000","...Nothing for now? Not to put undue pressure upon you, but the folk here are quite taken by the songs inspired by your tales. They await the next with bated breath, and I hope to be able to deliver ere long─with inspiration from your good self."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_000","Oho, what manner of thrilling adventure might this be?"
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_001","Good gods, a battle on the moon with Zodiark, eldest and mightiest of primals... I pride myself on my imagination, but your feats transcend aught my mind could possibly conceive."
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_002","Against all odds, you struck down the puissant being, yet triumph quickly turned to tragedy, for Zodiark's fall proved to be the trigger for the Final Days..."
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_003","...Yes. Yes, the words well up within me. Pray lend them an ear."
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_004","Born of ancient men, a divinity was freed,♪
Their hopes unrequited, they knew no reprieve.♪"
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_005","Born of mortal men, a champion did arise,♪
Ascending to the heavens, ruination to defy.♪"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_006","That the ancients should sacrifice half their number to save the star... The strength of their resolve makes me tremble in admiration."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_007","Even as it saddens me to think that one of their own would seek to lay it all to waste, so deep was his despair..."
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_008","Not having lived their lives, I feel decidedly unworthy to speak of their hearts. Better that the whole truth remain with you, and you alone."
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_009","Let it suffice for me to honor a fragment of their hopes and dreams in song, that their lives and sacrifice may ever be remembered."
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_010","Hm-hm, this promises to be a most rousing adventure!"
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_011","In order to prove your readiness to avert the Final Days, you undertook a trial imposed by no less a being than the will of the star, Hydaelyn Herself..."
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_012","It staggers the mind to imagine such an encounter, to say naught of the thousands of years that Venat had resolved to wait."
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_013","...Yes, I daresay I have a song. You will listen to it now, of course?"
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_014","Though eons apart, two kindred souls met,♪
Apart they would walk, all life to protect.♪"
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_015","Eons thence, their paths would converge,♪
As goddess and mortal, to silence the dirge.♪"
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_016","For time beyond counting, Hydaelyn waited for you in patience and faith. And when at last you were reunited, even as She desperately wished for you to surpass Her, She knew She could not hold back─and did not."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_017","Hers was an unenviable burden...and a noble sacrifice. Tears well in my eyes to imagine the hardships She has had to endure."
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_018","But it comforts me to know that Her long journey was not in vain. That Her hopes passed on to you."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_019","This tale is an epic among epics, and full honored am I to have been given the chance to weave a song for it. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you."
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_020","The Dragonsong War, you say?"
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_021","Quite some time has passed since that conflict drew to a close."
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_022","But having now survived the threat of the Final Days, I believe we may reflect more deeply upon the emotions that had driven man and dragon both. By all means, recount the tale for me."
29,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_023","I see. I see..."
30,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_024","I profess to weave words for a living...but on this occasion, they utterly fail me."
31,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_025","Yet this much, I will say: like an unwatched fire, pain and loss mustn't be left untended. For they were the embers that kindled a thousand-year conflict."
32,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_026","Tell me, my friend. Have you ever dwelled on that dark moment? Dwelled on what may have come to pass if the life which was lost was spared instead?"
33,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_027","'Tis said that there are no ifs in history, yet man is wont to cast his mind towards the path not walked."
34,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_028","In acknowledgement of this, I would sing of alternate eventualities..."
35,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_029","By naught but vigilance may silver mail endure,
Javelin's point never touch a comrade pure.♪"
36,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_030","Look back upon the paths we failed to take,
And prepare for the trials that lie in wait.♪"
37,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_031","As you may have noticed, I drew inspiration from the words the Archon Louisoix wrote in his journals in allusion to the Dragonsong War."
38,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_032","Some may dismiss the exercise as wishful pining. But by thus reflecting upon the past, I believe that we shall be better braced for the future."
39,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_033","So when you have a quiet moment, perhaps you too might look back and imagine it─the tale as it might have unfolded..."
40,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_040","A battle at the edge of existence, you say? Against a fearsome being known as the Endsinger..."
41,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_041","It goes without saying that I should like to hear about this! Pray, recount to me the tale of your mission from beginning to end!"
42,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_042","Good gods... I had known about the chaos of the Final Days, but never could I have imagined the events which brought them about."
43,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_043","I do wonder, though... Where might this Ultima Thule be located?"
44,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_044","Lest you misunderstand, I speak not of its physical location. If we wished to know that, I daresay we could have the coordinates from the Loporrits."
45,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_045","Nay, my friend. What I speak of, rather, is its essence."
46,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_046","According to your description, 'tis a space where emotions dictate reality. It seems to me that, in such a place, it would be nigh impossible to draw a line between what is real and what is felt."
47,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_047","In nature, there is a phenomenon wherein the structure of a massive object may resemble that of something diminutive."
48,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_048","Might it not be possible, then, that the structure of the sea of stars resembles that of the heart and mind─of the complex mechanisms that govern our feelings?"
49,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_049","On the assumption that it is so, I am led to wonder: what was the true nature of the Endsinger?"
50,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_050","What was it exactly that you defied at the edge of existence?"
51,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_051","Haha, these are just the wild ramblings of a minstrel. Pray do not lose sleep over it."
52,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_052","Still, I must say that the idea of an entity that hoards despair has quite roused my imagination. For instance..."
53,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_053","Had the Endsinger succeeded in gathering but a few more stars' worth of despair─nay, perhaps even that of a few more souls─might the outcome have been different?"
54,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_054","Yes, I believe I shall explore such an eventuality in song!"
55,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_055","The light of hope kindled by your comrades is brilliant. Alas, so dark is the despair you face, not even that light can pierce it..."
56,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_056","An inexorable verse of oblivion, performed at the farthest reaches of existence... I shall name it: the Endsinger's Aria!"
57,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_060","Good gods, a battle in the void! You've certainly wasted no time seeking out newfound adventure... By all means, regale me with the thrilling details!"
58,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_061","A world without death, where the strong devour the weak... And a woman touched by Darkness, who possesses the power to seal voidsent... Fascinating stuff indeed."
59,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_062","But this archfiend Barbariccia, as cruel as she is ravishing... Though she is fearsome enough by your account, I cannot help but wonder: what if she had devoured more of the great wyrm's aether? How terribly bright might her soul have shone then?"
60,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_063","...Yes, they come to me, the beginnings of a new verse. Pray listen, if you will."
61,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_064","In armor black, from shadowed lair,♪
The knight, with steely voice, declared.♪
A dragon's freedom he did steal,♪
Vict'ry in his crusade to seal.♪"
62,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_065","Wind made flesh, the archfiend fair,♪
Her pride, her long and lustrous hair.♪
On dragon soul she feasted well,♪
A tempest freed to toll the knell.♪"
63,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_066","Fighting to devour. Devouring to fight. Should the day come when this wheel is broken, would a voidsent greet her end with a wail of anguish? Or would she heave a sigh of relief?"
64,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_067","Whichever it may be, 'tis ironic to think that a soul who had sought freedom, and for so long, should end up being imprisoned in cold crystal."
65,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_068","Thus I would sing of that final battle. For in that lightless world, 'tis in such a moment, I believe, that their lives shine the brightest."
