2,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_Q1_000_001","What will you talk about?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_MINSTREL_MENU_CANCEL","Take your leave."
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_MINSTREL_NOSELECT_000","Oh, leaving so soon? I would be lying were I to say I wasn't disappointed, but I appreciate that a hero such as you has great demands upon <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> time. I shall look forward to hearing your adventures when you have a spare moment."
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_MINSTREL_NOCONTENT_000","...Nothing for now? Not to put undue pressure upon you, but the folk here are quite taken by the songs inspired by your tales. They await the next with bated breath, and I hope to be able to deliver ere long─with inspiration from your good self."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_000","Oho, what manner of thrilling adventure might this be?"
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_001","Good gods, a battle on the moon with Zodiark, eldest and mightiest of primals... I pride myself on my imagination, but your feats transcend aught my mind could possibly conceive."
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_002","Against all odds, you struck down the puissant being, yet triumph quickly turned to tragedy, for Zodiark's fall proved to be the trigger for the Final Days..."
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_003","...Yes. Yes, the words well up within me. Pray lend them an ear."
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_004","Born of ancient men, a divinity was freed,♪
Their hopes unrequited, they knew no reprieve.♪"
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_005","Born of mortal men, a champion did arise,♪
Ascending to the heavens, ruination to defy.♪"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_006","That the ancients should sacrifice half their number to save the star... The strength of their resolve makes me tremble in admiration."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_007","Even as it saddens me to think that one of their own would seek to lay it all to waste, so deep was his despair..."
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_008","Not having lived their lives, I feel decidedly unworthy to speak of their hearts. Better that the whole truth remain with you, and you alone."
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_009","Let it suffice for me to honor a fragment of their hopes and dreams in song, that their lives and sacrifice may ever be remembered."
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_010","Hm-hm, this promises to be a most rousing adventure!"
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_011","In order to prove your readiness to avert the Final Days, you undertook a trial imposed by no less a being than the will of the star, Hydaelyn Herself..."
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_012","It staggers the mind to imagine such an encounter, to say naught of the thousands of years that Venat had resolved to wait."
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_013","...Yes, I daresay I have a song. You will listen to it now, of course?"
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_014","Though eons apart, two kindred souls met,♪
Apart they would walk, all life to protect.♪"
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_015","Eons thence, their paths would converge,♪
As goddess and mortal, to silence the dirge.♪"
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_016","For time beyond counting, Hydaelyn waited for you in patience and faith. And when at last you were reunited, even as She desperately wished for you to surpass Her, She knew She could not hold back─and did not."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_017","Hers was an unenviable burden...and a noble sacrifice. Tears well in my eyes to imagine the hardships She has had to endure."
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_018","But it comforts me to know that Her long journey was not in vain. That Her hopes passed on to you."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_019","This tale is an epic among epics, and full honored am I to have been given the chance to weave a song for it. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you."

42,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_042","Good gods... I had known about the chaos of the Final Days, but never could I have imagined the events which brought them about."
43,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_043","I do wonder, though... Where might this Ultima Thule be located?"
44,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_044","Lest you misunderstand, I speak not of its physical location. If we wished to know that, I daresay we could have the coordinates from the Loporrits."
45,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_045","Nay, my friend. What I speak of, rather, is its essence."
46,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_046","According to your description, 'tis a space where emotions dictate reality. It seems to me that, in such a place, it would be nigh impossible to draw a line between what is real and what is felt."
47,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_047","In nature, there is a phenomenon wherein the structure of a massive object may resemble that of something diminutive."
48,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_048","Might it not be possible, then, that the structure of the sea of stars resembles that of the heart and mind─of the complex mechanisms that govern our feelings?"
49,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_049","On the assumption that it is so, I am led to wonder: what was the true nature of the Endsinger?"

51,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_051","Haha, these are just the wild ramblings of a minstrel. Pray do not lose sleep over it."
52,"TEXT_CTSOPN60WANDERINGMINSTREL_00728_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_052","Still, I must say that the idea of an entity that hoards despair has quite roused my imagination. For instance..."
