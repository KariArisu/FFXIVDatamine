7,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_000","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry I-)A young child was brought in today. So very young to be suffering so. But if anyone can save her, 'tis we sages of Physis Technon. And save her we will."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_001","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry II-)Though it took many days and repeated treatments, we have managed to stabilize our most recent patient. We adapted the Eukrasia spell, as my clever husband proposed, and it worked wonders. His brilliance truly belies his youth. Despite being fifty years my junior, he has already achieved so much."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_010","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry III-)The child has taken a turn for the worse. Her corporeal aether wanes at an alarming rate, and she cannot keep food down, having vomited all she has been given. Though we are able to keep her with us, it is naught but a stopgap measure."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_011","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry IV-)I reviewed past cases and all existing literature, but found no effective treatment. Yet there must be something we can do─something that no one has yet thought to try..."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_012","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry V-)Muscmaloi may be the answer. We Viera have used this medicinal herb since ancient times. Though potentially poisonous, through refinement, we should be able to suppress the adverse effects."
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_020","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry VI-)The muscmaloi has arrived. As expected, it is highly effective in strengthening one's aether, but so too does it poison. We must find a way to separate its beneficial constituents, else it cannot be administered for any extended period."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_021","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry VII-)We administered a diluted extract of muscmaloi after the patient fell unconscious. Though she awakened a few hours later, she was extremely agitated, and it took several people to subdue her."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_022","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry VIII-)We can no longer dismiss the inherent risks in the treatment. We must submit a report to the Studium on the dangers of muscmaloi, ere someone else repeats our mistake..."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_023","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry IX-)The pain has returned, worse than before. This disease eats away at me, and I fear I do not have much time left. Yet there is still so much to do. So very much..."
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_030","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry X-)To my shame, I collapsed while treating the child. I do not recall ever seeing my husband so distressed. Touched though I am, I'd rather that he didn't fuss over me. He knows my prognosis."
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_031","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry XI-)As sages, it is our duty to fight for the future of all lives. Soon, I will no longer be able to fight this fight, but it is my hope that someone will carry on in my stead. To that end, I, Hatia, will pour myself into this soul crystal."
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_032","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry XII-)My love,
In case this is my last chance, I want you to know that I'm glad I met you. You made me the happiest woman, and even should I be reborn─"

20,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_GUILDIVAIN_000_040","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry in Another Hand I-)Gone, gone, gone. To dust and dirt. A future cut short for no reason but that her body failed her. But the child lives. She may still serve a purpose."
21,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_GUILDIVAIN_000_041","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry in Another Hand II-)I have acquired a subject with a tolerance for muscmaloi. A Viera who has taken the herb from childhood. Should I finally put the cavalcade of failures behind me and succeed, it will be a great step forward for all mankind."
22,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_GUILDIVAIN_000_042","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry in Another Hand III-)That Jinjahl woman continues to sniff around. Too curious by half. I shall have to find a more private place to continue my work. And if she persists, well. It will be on her own head."
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_GUILDIVAIN_000_043","(-Diary of a Sage, Entry in Another Hand IV-)Who should I meet today but an adventurer who has your soul crystal. I would be lying if I were to say I wasn't disappointed that you chose a vagabond over me. But no matter. I will continue my work. And I pray, my love, that one day you will forgive the man I've had to become."
