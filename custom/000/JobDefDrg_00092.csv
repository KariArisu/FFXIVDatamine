6,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRG_00092_ALBERIC_000_3","In the past this duty fell not to the knights of the See, but to a specialized brigade known as the dragoons. In my younger days, I was one of them─verily, their leader, bearing the title of Azure Dragoon."
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRG_00092_ALBERIC_000_4","Many years ago, I retired from active duty to serve the See. My former post is now held by my erstwhile student, an accomplished young dragoon by the name of Estinien."

10,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRG_00092_ALBERIC_000_7","Dragoons must display complete mastery of their chosen weapon, the lance, that they might stand against their immense foe. The leader of the dragoons is known as the Azure Dragoon, and is chosen by the Eye, a relic guarded within the Holy See which bestows upon the chosen one the power of the dragon."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRG_00092_ALBERIC_000_8","And yet this power is as a double-edged sword, for if the dragoon does not maintain absolute control over his emotions, he shall fall under the thrall of the very wyrms that he would slay. But so it always has been─no great power comes without a cost."
