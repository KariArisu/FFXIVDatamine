0,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_1","This here's the Miners' Guild. Is there something you'd like to know?"
1,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_A1_000_1","Tell me about yourself."
3,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_A1_000_2","What do miners do?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_2","I'm Adalberta, the master of this guild. It's my job to look after those miners who've put their names down on our roll. This includes instructing them in the finer points of our trade."
6,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_3","We get commissions from mining concerns and various other places, and I send the best suited among us to go and fulfill them. If needs be, I provide such advice and support as I'm able."
7,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_4","It's not easy, managing a boisterous bunch of lads and lasses who'd sooner drain a tankard than swing a pickaxe, but I give it my best. At the end of the day, that's all anyone can do."
8,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_5","Plainly put, we miners locate and dig up the mineral wealth that sleeps beneath the ground."
9,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_6","Without us toiling out in the wilds, folk wouldn't have metal for arms and armor, nor gemstones for trinkets and baubles."
10,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_7","Make no mistake, mining is grueling work, and we're dog-tired most of our waking hours. But nothing compares to the thrill of triumph we experience when the earth yields up our prize."
11,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_8","Aye, I'd say that we dig for that feeling as much as we dig to earn our coin. But no matter your goals, our doors are open to all who aren't afraid to work hard and get dirty."
12,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_010","Good to see you again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. The digging's been good, I hope?"
13,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_020","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! What in Thal's name are you doing here!? You're wanted by the Brass Blades!"
14,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_021","Look, all of us here at the guild will help you in whatever way we can, but there's only so much we can do. Promise me you'll lie low, alright?"
15,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_030","Well, well, if it isn't the <Emphasis>professor</Emphasis>! Haha, aye, I've heard what the sellswords in Ishgard call you."
16,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_031","I suppose there's some sense in the name. We <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> experts in our own right, shaving away at rock and digging up the treasure beneath the soils. In any case, I'm waiting to hear tales of your exploits!"
17,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_035","It sounds like you went through thick and thin with Oschon's Raiders! I'm glad you've managed to come back alive and unharmed."
18,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_036","Well, while you were away, Wide Gulley has been working twice as hard as ever before. I think knowing that you were making a name for yourself in Ishgard has pushed him to it."
19,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_040","Hello again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I trust everything is going well with the job in Idyllshire?"
20,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_041","I know you'll be able to handle any problems that pop up. I must say, I'm looking forward to hearing all about the job when you're finished with it."
21,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_060","I've heard all about how you helped liberate Ala Mhigo. Haven't lived there since I was a child, but I'm grateful to you all the same."
22,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_061","Much as I'd love to move back, I can't abandon my duties here at the guild. Though I am going to check to see if there's anything I can do to help them."
23,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_050","Sounds like you did a fine job for that manufactory."
24,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_051","The chief sent a letter saying how grateful he is for your help. He claims you did wonders for his team's morale!"
25,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_070","If the tales are to be believed, you journeyed to the surface of the moon, yes? I suppose you had a bit too much on your plate to engage in a spot of mining, but if you do have the chance to bring something back, I'd love to see it."
26,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"
27,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_A2_000_001","How fares the guild?"
28,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_A2_000_002","What do miners do?"
29,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_A2_000_003","Nothing."
30,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_100","Things are on the mend between Deep Canyon and myself, but there's no denying that awkwardness remains."
31,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_101","With time, though, I'm confident that we can regain a semblance of what we used to share. For now, I'm simply glad that we are on speaking terms again."
32,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_200","I've reached out to House Fortemps and an acquaintance or two in Idyllshire to see if they'd be interested in working with us. I imagine it'll be a while yet before anything is officially agreed, but they seem keen."
33,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_201","If things go well it'll be easier than ever for us to mine in areas like Dravania and Coerthas. Wide Gulley seemed especially excited by the prospect."
34,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_202","'Course, none of this would even be possible without your help. Thanks, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
35,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_210","As always, the guild's been through its share of ups and downs. Relations with the Amalj'aa have been much improved of late, and Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern was quick to make the most of the situation, as you can imagine."
36,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_211","Although turning a profit is ever their main concern, they've made efforts to share the land and resources with our neighbors, that we may coexist peacefully."
37,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_212","Then there's our role in assisting with the reconstruction of Garlemald. Rather than engage in any large-scale mining operations in the frozen north, it's more efficient for the time being to have the necessary ore and such shipped in from abroad. That's where we come in."
38,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_213","So, yes, while we've been extremely busy, things are heading in a promising direction. Whatever happens, miners like us will always be in demand, so we'll keep doing what we do best."
39,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_110","Oh dear, did you take a knock on the head from some falling rocks? Just to make certain that you're still in possession of your wits, I'll answer your question and see if you can follow my words."
40,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_111","Plainly put, we miners locate and dig up the mineral wealth that sleeps beneath the ground."
41,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_112","Without us toiling out in the wilds, folk wouldn't have metal for arms and armor, nor gemstones for trinkets and baubles."
42,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_113","Make no mistake, mining is grueling work, and we're dog-tired most of our waking hours. But nothing compares to the thrill of triumph we experience when the earth yields up our prize."
43,"TEXT_REGWILMINGUILD_00065_ADALBERTA_000_114","Aye, I'd say that we dig for that feeling as much as we dig to earn our coin. But no matter your goals, our doors are open to all who aren't afraid to work hard and get dirty."
