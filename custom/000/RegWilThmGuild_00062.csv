6,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_010","I am the Piercing Eye, the Duke of Destruction, the Archmage of Annihilation...though most of my colleagues simply call me “Cocobuki.”"
7,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_011","Of the five thaumaturge brothers that claim the title of “Guildmaster,” I am the eldest."
8,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_012","I offer guidance to those wishing to explore the stygian chasm of our discipline, and instruct aspirants in the art of arcane devastation."
9,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_013","It is also my role to encourage the accumulation of thaumaturgical wisdom through both theoretical study and practical application."

11,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_021","The origin of our art can be found in the cumbersome magicks of our ancestors─subsequently focused and refined through their use in the funereal rites of the Order of Nald'thal."
12,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_022","Though once used exclusively for the preparation of the dead, these incantations of destruction soon found new purpose on the battlefield."
13,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_023","Hm hm hm... “Death,” of course, is still very much the central focus of the discipline."
14,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_030","Hm hm hm... Though the expedition continues, in my capacity as guildmaster, I make a point of appearing here occasionally to ensure that all is in order."

16,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_032","...No, never mind. Forget I mentioned anything."
17,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_040","Hm hm hm... The way you employed our art at the Tower of Babil was most impressive. <Emphasis>Explosive</Emphasis>."
18,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_041","...Speaking of explosive─prior to the contingent's departure, our youngest brother furnished us with a concoction that would keep us warm."
19,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_042","But upon drinking it, my entire body became blazing hot─a veritable volcano. For a time, it was all I could do not to erupt fire from my mouth. When I speak of my love for incineration, it doesn't usually include my own innards..."

22,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_061","...I am not surprised that a thaumaturge of your unique skill was thus chosen. The ancient arts of destruction are indeed stunning in their magnificence...and deadly in their seductive power. I pray you do not fall too deeply into <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> particular abyss."
23,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_070","Hm hm hm... I see you now flirt with darkness of an entirely different nature.

24,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_071","Hm hm hm... You think darkness is your ally? Be wary, <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, for darkness bears no allegiances. "
25,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_072","The Scions came to us, seeking succor for their fallen companions. I am afraid thaumaturgy could offer no solution, but surely you have pulled yourself free of far darker abysses than this?"
26,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_100_072","The Scions reached out to us regarding their fallen companions. They also mentioned the rather fascinating detail that you had traveled to and back from another world. Ever finding new ways to surprise, aren't you? Hm hm hm..."
27,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_110_072","Hm hm hm... I am reliably informed that your fallen companions have awakened once more. Also that you have performed some great deeds in that other world, delivering it from its doom, freeing its denizens from tyranny, and so on and so forth. I would expect no less of our finest student."
28,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_073","Hm hm hm... I can feel the aetheric energy within you burgeoning to nigh inconceivable heights.

29,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_074","Having plunged deeper and deeper into the abyss, one might say that your very existence is the embodiment of shadow itself."
30,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_Q2_000_1","What will you ask?"
31,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_A2_000_1","How fares the guild?"

36,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_101","I am both amused and amazed at the threats they are now capable of facing. Even with all my years of arcane experience, the abyss of thaumaturgy holds nooks and crannies I have yet to explore."
37,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_102","And Cocobusi? He continues with his alchemical research, but now occasionally trades his alembic for an apron. Though his aetheric reserves are as low as ever, I am convinced that the exquisite dodo omelette he served us for dinner last night was produced by some manner of wizardry..."
38,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_104","Hm hm hm... Lalai continues her pursuit of arcane knowledge with all the prudence and discretion of a charging bull. Why, at times she even reminds me of Cocobusi when he was inconveniently possessed."
39,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_105","Why, they say that just the other day she attempted to take a forbidden tome housing a most terrible voidsent from the shelves. Yayake wouldn't let me hear the end of it."
40,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_106","I've warned her time and again that she must follow proper protocol if she wishes to stay in the good graces of the Order, but the girl seems ill inclined to acquiesce. I do not want to see her ruin all she has accomplished, so I will do what I can to help her see the light."
41,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_107","Hm hm hm... During the expedition to Ilsabard, my brothers and I bore witness to hellish horrors. To darkest darkness."
42,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_108","Yet there was also a light─the light of an all-consuming blaze. It melted away the despair that crawled up from the depths, and shone the way forward, towards hope. To whom that light refers, I trust I needn't say."
43,"TEXT_REGWILTHMGUILD_00062_COCOBUKI_000_109","Drawing inspiration from said light, we are more determined than ever to not be outdone by Prelate Yayake. No, we will strive to make a better guild, and for this we must examine whence we have come, and whereto we wish to go."
