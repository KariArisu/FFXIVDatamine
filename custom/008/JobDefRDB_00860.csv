1,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_A1_000_001","How fare you of late?"
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_A1_000_002","What is a viper?"
4,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_100","Just like back in Tural, I've been working as a viper, putting down all kinds of beasts. Only difference now is that Golias is the one finding clients for me."
6,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_101","We must be doing something right, 'cause the gil's been rolling in. Still got a ways to go till I've earned enough for the ferry ride back home, though."
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_102","Golias actually suggested using some of my savings to pay for trips to Ishgard and Sharlayan so I can hunt marks farther afield."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_103","I'm happy to go wherever I'm needed, even if getting there sets me back a few gil."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_200","The art of the viper has been passed down in Tural since ancient times. We use it to protect folk from deadly creatures."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_201","Back home, we got beasts called tural vidraal to deal with. They're usually an offshoot of a more common species, but are larger, meaner, and often have strange powers to boot."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_202","That's why our ancestors looked to snakes for inspiration, because they can take on foes a whole lot bigger than themselves. Our fighting techniques are designed to mimic their quick, agile movements."
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_203","After a while, people started calling us “vipers” and I guess the name stuck."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_204","We still specialize in hunting tural vidraal, but we'll deal with any beast that needs killing."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_205","So while there are no vidraal here in Eorzea, I can carry on like I would back in Tural, putting my skills to use for the benefit of all."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_206","Though if I were to hit the road again...I heard tell about these creatures way east of here that, over the passing of many years, apparently gained powers similar to those of vidraal. Folk out there call 'em “auspices.”"
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFRDB_00860_KESHKWA_000_207","Might be nice to meet one in the flesh. See how they compare to tural vidraal."
