1,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_008_000","Hmmm? I'm sort of busy here, um, looking at the, uh...the grass. It's quite green, I've noticed, and...ugh, you're gonna ask me to clear the area, aren't you?"
2,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_008_005","Oh well all right then, let's get this over with."
3,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_008_010","Oh, that's a relief. I am <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> in the mood to clear an entire ridge right now. Or ever, really."
4,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_SYSTEM_008_000","Clear the ridge to build a cropland?"

6,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_Q1_008_005","Not right now."
7,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_009_000","Look at me, jumping with excitement. A fault in the programming, to be sure. Anyway, are you happy now? There's the cropland. I've even got some seeds for you to sow. Once they've been planted, make sure to water them."
8,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_009_005","Oh─if you have any questions, I suppose I can answer them."

17,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_011_000","Well, now that you've planted the seeds, naturally you need to water them, right? This is real basic stuff."
18,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_SYSTEM_011_000","You may water a plot that has been sown with seeds by accessing it with the Water mode enabled."
19,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_012_000","Shhh... Can you hear that? The sound of burgeoning life, budding in the soil? Me neither, but I thought I'd ask. Anyway, you're welcome to plant more seeds here whenever you like."

33,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_200_000","You're giving me that look. That look where you want me to do something. Let me guess, you want more space for crops? <Emphasis>Fine</Emphasis>, I'll do it, but only because I have to."
34,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_200_005","There you are, an expanded cropland. More plots for more crops. Surely you'll never need more space than this, right? Please tell me I'm right."
35,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_300_000","Really? Again? I swear, this is the <Emphasis>last</Emphasis> time I'm doing this. Unless you tell me to do it again, in which case I guess I'll do it again. But watch yourself, or I'll put you on my bad list right next to that abominable furball!"
36,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_300_005","Well, I hope you don't regret making the cropland larger, because there's no going back now. It's reached a size where you could build another one inside of it. That is <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> a suggestion, by the way."
37,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_300_010","With the size the cropland's become, I'm sure even you are loath to deal with it. As am I. But, as long as you pay me─and my team─I suppose we can help you look after it. We'll need a set of mammet-sized cropworker's tools to do so, though."
38,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_300_015","Here, I'll give you the recipe. Just let me know when you've finished crafting the tools."
39,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_300_020","Wait, I feel like there was something else... Oh, right! I've decided to start selling the seeds I've collected. You're welcome to purchase them, if you like."
40,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_300_025","Anyway, I'll be here if you need me."

50,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_500_000","Hmmm? What? Oh yes, yes we're working quite hard. Nearly finished with the expansion, we are. We were going to leave the last bit until tomorrow, but now that you're here, we might as well work ourselves to the bone."
51,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_600_000","Oh, you wouldn't be interested in the gardening services. I'm sure you love tending to crops yourself. But, if you would for some reason deny yourself of such an enriching experience, my team and I can─if we must─help you look after the crops."
52,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_600_005","That said, the cropland has hardly reached a size you're unable to handle. And I hardly have a so-called team. Therefore, I can hardly offer such services at this time."
53,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_600_010","Well, we could, if you gave us the means to do so. Which you have not. If you really want our help, I suggest you craft a set of mammet-sized cropworker's tools."
54,"TEXT_CTSMJICROPLAND_00804_TAGAYASU_600_015","And is that a set of mammet-sized cropworker's tools I see there?

I mean, we certainly can't take care of crops as well as you can with our tiny mammet hands. Hells, we could probably fit in an empty plot if you stuck us in one."
