1,"TEXT_REGSAK6HHUSATAHWI_00880_HHUTEPI_000_001","Have you heard anything about those strange flying contraptions in the sky? They're just sitting there. Menacingly... So long as they're keen not to move, I try not to think about them. But anyway, something I can help you with, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>sir</If>?"

8,"TEXT_REGSAK6HHUSATAHWI_00880_HHUTEPI_000_004","With as many merchants and travelers as we have passing through, we've had need for a guide to help folks find what they're looking for here. That's where I come in. The name's Hhutepi, by the way."
9,"TEXT_REGSAK6HHUSATAHWI_00880_HHUTEPI_000_005","Would that I could boast this is all out of the kindness of my own heart, but we've all got to make a living somehow. That's not to say I'll charge you, mind─the businesses offer me a fee to put would-be customers in contact with them."
10,"TEXT_REGSAK6HHUSATAHWI_00880_HHUTEPI_000_006","Simply put, this here's a trading town. Biggest one this side of Zorgor the Boundless, I'd wager."
11,"TEXT_REGSAK6HHUSATAHWI_00880_HHUTEPI_000_007","Mighty impressive considering there was nothing here but a few years ago. Kemakka and his family bought up the land, erected an aetheryte, then started building storage houses for imported goods."
