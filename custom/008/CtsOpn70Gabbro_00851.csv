4,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_A1_000_004","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_100","Though the light-heavyweight division is the lowest tier of the championship, you surprised one and all by rising up as champion without the use of feral souls."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_101","And you didn't stop there. When former heavyweight fighter Wicked Thunder unexpectedly appeared to challenge you, you bested her as well. Never have we seen such drama at the Arcadion!"
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_102","Like most others, I watched your matches at the edge of my seat, but I've been most keen to hear your firsthand account. Pray spare no detail!"
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_103","Hm-hm! Your words have provided me with insight and inspiration both! With a few embellishments, I believe I can produce a story that will grip the reader from start to finish!"

10,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_A1_100_100","Embellishments...?"
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_A2_100_100","You're not going to tell it as it happened?"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_104","Lest you misunderstand, my works are not intended to be accurate records of events. In the name of a good story, I may take some liberties with certain details."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_105","For example...what if Black Cat had brought even deadlier techniques to bear against you?"
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_106","Or if Honey B. Lovely, whose sweet facade concealed a terrible temper, had become further enraged?"
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_107","What sort of carnage might have unfolded if the Brute Bomber had stooped to lower lows to seize victory?"
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_108","And last but not least, what if Wicked Thunder refused to retreat, resolving instead to fight on?"
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_109","In such a manner do I let my mind wander when I produce my works. And this time, I'm confident that I have a best seller on my hands!"

20,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_400","You wish to talk? I could tell you a little more about myself, I suppose..."
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_401","I'm a cartoonist, as you know, and I primarily draw inspiration from the matches at the Arcadion."
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_402","My cartoons enjoy great popularity here in Solution Nine, even if I do say so myself."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN70GABBRO_00851_GABBRO_000_403","And mark my words, my next series featuring you as the protagonist is guaranteed to be a best seller!"
