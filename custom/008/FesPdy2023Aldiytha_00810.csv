8,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_001","Following the events of the “Legend of the Lost Lady”─by which I mean after Sultan Baldric served as seneschal to a miller girl─he chose to do the same each year for other Ul'dahn ladies. It is said that this was his way of reminding himself and others that all girls should be treasured."
9,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_002","Then, one year, the girl he had chosen to be princess for a day presented him with a bouquet of daisies, to thank him for his service."
10,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_003","Knowing how hard the girl had worked to pick them, the sultan gladly accepted the flowers, and bade his attendants fashion them into circlets. Then, removing his own royal crown, he placed one on his head, and another on hers. “We're the same, you and I,” he said, smiling."
11,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_004","The Thorne family has considered daisies to be symbols of happiness ever since."
12,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_005","...You look as though you have something on your mind. Do you perchance know something I do not concerning the flower crowns?"
13,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_006","I see, you are not at liberty to say... I understand. Not every adventure is a tale that can be shared."
14,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_007","But if I am honest with you, that only makes me more curious to know. I hope you can one day tell me of this secret adventure."
15,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_010","Fortin Thorne is my father and the head of House Thorne. It is his duty as representative of our family to sponsor Little Ladies' Day each year."
16,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_011","Or, so I once thought. I realize now that for him, it is far more than duty which binds him to this celebration. Little Ladies' Day is the very thing which brought him and Mother together, and it is her memory and his love for her that drives him to ensure it continues."
17,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_012","Much like how Princess Edvya and her father, Sultan Baldric, were able to see each other in a new light after her disappearance, I feel as though my father and I have a better understanding of one another after all that's happened today."
18,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_015","Claudia Thorne...my mother, and eldest daughter of House Thorne before her passing. I am told she left this world soon after I was born into it."
19,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_016","Her frequent bouts of illness prevented her from joining social functions held amongst the noble families of Ul'dah, but by pure chance, she was able to attend a Little Ladies' Day celebration long ago, where she met my father, and performed the Little Ladies' Dance for him."
20,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_017","There is much I have still yet to learn about my mother, but from all I've been told, I cannot help but feel as though we had much in common. It makes me feel closer to her, as though some part of her is still alive in me."
21,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_020","Though Ul'dah was founded by the House of Ul, control of the throne was wrested from them after a period of instability, with the House of Thorne being appointed to rule as stewards some three hundred and fifty summers ago."
22,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_021","For more than a century, my forebears ruled, enacting countless reforms which would see their governance regarded favorably by the citizenry."
23,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_022","At the end of those many long years, feeling that their sworn duty had at last been fulfilled, my ancestors returned rule to the Ul Dynasty. To this day, we of House Thorne continue to do our part to see Ul'dah flourish."
24,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_025","In the years following the incident with the miller girl, Princess Edvya grew to become a fine lady, attending royal soirées and the like on occasion─just as expected of her. In spite of this, she remained true to herself, forthright and bold as ever."
25,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_026","On one fateful evening, she took her folding fan─an accessory noblewomen used in those days for the express purpose of covering their faces as a form of etiquette─and instead flourished it about her, using it to perform a dance she had improvised on the spot."
26,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_027","While the sultan and his retinue of seneschals were stunned by her impromptu performance, the nobles in attendance were instead captivated by its beauty, and applauded her when she finished."
27,"TEXT_FESPDY2023ALDIYTHA_00810_ALDIYTHA_000_028","In time, Princess Edvya's dance came to be known as the “Little Ladies' Dance,” and it, alongside the folding fan, have been passed down through the women of House Thorne ever since."
