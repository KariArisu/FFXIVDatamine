2,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_Q1_000_001","What story will you share?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_MENU_CANCEL","Nothing."
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_002","Oh, have you come just to say hello? I appreciate the gesture, to be sure, just as I appreciate that you are a busy <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>. Even so, I do hope you find time in the future to regale me with a tale or two."
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_003","...Ah, I understand. You have no tales worth telling─yet, that is. I know for certain 'tis but a matter of time until you are thrust into the heart of matters most dramatic."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_004","Fortunately, the denizens of this city are great lovers of tall tales and thrilling verse. They simply cannot hear enough of your exploits, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Thank you for being my ever-dependable muse."
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_005","So, what have you brought for me today?"
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_006","You did battle with Valigarmanda!? The tural vidraal of legend, dubbed the Skyruin, who ruled the heavens by beak and talon. Many are the legend of this beast among beasts, but I would wager the telling of your battle is more thrilling than the most harrowing tales!"
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_007","By the hands of a devious scoundrel was the seal put in place by Gulool Ja Ja broken, and thus was the living calamity unleashed again upon the world...only to be struck down by Wuk Lamat and her mighty companion!"
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_008","This glimpse into the events of the rite of succession shall provide me with more than enough inspiration for my next song. Thank you for sharing it with me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_009","By the by, do you know the meaning of the term “tural vidraal”?"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_010","In the language of the Mamool Ja, it means “that which clings to the earth.” A fitting description for beings powerful enough to claim an entire continent as their territory. And Valigarmanda was said to be the most formidable among them."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_011","Though you emerged victorious, the fiend was but recently roused from slumber. What do you suppose would have happened had Valigarmanda been given sufficient time to regain its strength?"
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_012","Hah, such questions are why we have imaginations, yes? And imagine I shall... The mightiest heroes of Etheirys matched against the full fury of Valigarmanda. A story for the ages!"
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_020","So, what have you brought for me today?"
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_021","Ah, the final moments of the former Dawnservant's firstborn. His story gives rise to a complex mixture of emotions, and it would be insulting to call it something so trite as an adventurous tale."
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_022","As the only true son of Gulool Ja Ja, he doubtless felt a heavy burden of responsibility to be deemed worthy of succeeding his father. This weight was likely made all the more stifling by the fact he had but one head."
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_023","And so he sought great power to make up for his perceived shortcomings. Yet he could never quite live up to the expectations he set for himself, and in his blind pursuit, he stepped upon a crooked path..."
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_024","For thirty long years did he keep company with anger in that dome... Yet no amount of anguish can justify the countless lives he stole. "
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_025","You know what I believe, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? I believe the moment Zoraal Ja killed his own father, whose admiration he fought so hard to win, his life lost all meaning."
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_026","His sins cannot be forgiven, 'tis true. Yet his story is a tragic one, and I suspect each of us can see parts of ourselves reflected within it. "
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_027","Thank you for sharing it with me. A dark shadow loomed over the rite of succession, and we would do best not to forget he who cast it."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_028","While many will view Zoraal Ja as a murderer and tyrant, reducing him to a mindless villain will blunt the impact of the lessons we can learn from his fate. This is a tale that must be told with great care..."
