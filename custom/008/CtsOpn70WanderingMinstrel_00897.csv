I appreciate the gesture, to be sure, just as I appreciate that you are a busy <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>. Even so, I do hope you find time in the future to regale me with a tale or two."

8,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_006","You did battle with Valigarmanda!? The tural vidraal of legend, dubbed the Skyruin, who ruled the heavens by beak and talon. Many are the legend of this beast among beasts, but I would wager the telling of your battle is more thrilling than the most harrowing tales!"
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_007","By the hands of a devious scoundrel was the seal put in place by Gulool Ja Ja broken, and thus was the living calamity unleashed again upon the world...only to be struck down by Wuk Lamat and her mighty companion!"
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_008","This glimpse into the events of the rite of succession shall provide me with more than enough inspiration for my next song. Thank you for sharing it with me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_009","By the by, do you know the meaning of the term “tural vidraal”?"
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_010","In the language of the Mamool Ja, it means “that which clings to the earth.” A fitting description for beings powerful enough to claim an entire continent as their territory. And Valigarmanda was said to be the most formidable among them."
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_011","Though you emerged victorious, the fiend was but recently roused from slumber. What do you suppose would have happened had Valigarmanda been given sufficient time to regain its strength?"
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_012","Hah, such questions are why we have imaginations, yes? And imagine I shall... The mightiest heroes of Etheirys matched against the full fury of Valigarmanda. A story for the ages!"

16,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_021","Ah, the final moments of the former Dawnservant's firstborn. His story gives rise to a complex mixture of emotions, and it would be insulting to call it something so trite as an adventurous tale."
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_022","As the only true son of Gulool Ja Ja, he doubtless felt a heavy burden of responsibility to be deemed worthy of succeeding his father. This weight was likely made all the more stifling by the fact he had but one head."
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_023","And so he sought great power to make up for his perceived shortcomings. Yet he could never quite live up to the expectations he set for himself, and in his blind pursuit, he stepped upon a crooked path..."
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_024","For thirty long years did he keep company with anger in that dome... Yet no amount of anguish can justify the countless lives he stole. "
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_025","You know what I believe, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? I believe the moment Zoraal Ja killed his own father, whose admiration he fought so hard to win, his life lost all meaning."
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_026","His sins cannot be forgiven, 'tis true. Yet his story is a tragic one, and I suspect each of us can see parts of ourselves reflected within it. "
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_027","Thank you for sharing it with me. A dark shadow loomed over the rite of succession, and we would do best not to forget he who cast it."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_028","While many will view Zoraal Ja as a murderer and tyrant, reducing him to a mindless villain will blunt the impact of the lessons we can learn from his fate. This is a tale that must be told with great care..."

27,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_033","Being so very different from what we know, such a way of life is difficult for us to accept. Indeed, it seemed only inevitable that you should come into conflict with Sphene."
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_034","She herself was not among the living, but an entity brought forth to fulfill a certain objective. And therein, I believe, lay the root of this tale's tragedy."
29,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_035","Recreated from the noblest of souls though she was, she was helpless to defy the purpose to which she had been bound: protecting the Endless no matter the cost."
30,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_036","Thus did she continue on her destructive path, though she knew it led only to a dead end."
31,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_037","A question if you may, my friend. Deep in your heart, do you believe that the Sphene whom you met was alive?"
32,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_Q5_000_001","What will you say?"
33,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_A5_000_002","She was alive, in her own way."
34,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_A5_000_003","Though she was many things, she wasn't alive."
35,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_A5_000_004","I'm not sure..."
36,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_038","So you think that. Even with the knowledge that her existence differed from the living, you hold that she was alive..."
37,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_039","I see. Indeed, her existence differed greatly from the living. There is no changing that fact."
38,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_040","I see. Though her existence differed much from the living, precisely what does it mean to be alive? 'Tis no easy thing to define."
39,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_041","I thank you for your honest answer. I shall take it to heart."
40,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_042","For my part, whether or not she was possessed of life, I believe that there existed an individual called Sphene, who cared deeply for her people. Who heard the voices of her people, felt as they did, and thought only for their welfare. "
41,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_043","That is why, at battle's end, she returned as the gentle soul you knew."
42,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_044","But here, a thought fills me with dread. What if that soul failed to return, and the fearsome entity she had become continued its relentless onslaught?"
43,"TEXT_CTSOPN70WANDERINGMINSTREL_00897_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_045","Might it have succeeded in its objective, and plundered life force from other realities at the cost of untold destruction...? Of such a possibility shall I sing, that we might give thanks for the path we were mercifully spared."
