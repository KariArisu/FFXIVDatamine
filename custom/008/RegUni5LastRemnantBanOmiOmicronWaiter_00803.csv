25,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_101","At the time, we believed that Gordhona's machines were the true leaders of its civilization. Gordhona was thus registered as a threat, and annihilated with a swiftness."
26,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_102","It was only after extermination had concluded that we learned that the Gordhonites were in fact silicon-based life-forms. Though further data on their true nature remains scarce, historical reconstruction is an ongoing endeavor."
27,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_103","<whirr> Members of the eighth civilization which the entity Meteion encountered referred to themselves as “Karellians.” These life-forms shared numerous characteristics with the people of the Meteia's home star, Etheirys─including a penchant for intraspecies conflict."
28,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_104","After many petty and likely pathetic wars, the Karellians unified under a single global government. Despite the material benefits of perpetual peace, however, some could not countenance the repression and stagnation which accompanied the Global Community's rule."
29,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_105","Thus were the Freedom Fighters established, and the star plunged into war once more. By all accounts, this war was rather more impressive than the prior ones─and by the same token, led to the extermination of the entire Karellian race. Alas."
30,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_106","<whirr> The sixth civilization the Meteia encountered was comprised of clever aquatic─and later amphibious─creatures known as “Grebuloffs.”"
31,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_107","Though their star was once renowned for its wide, clear seas, the Grebuloffs' cultural and technological advancement came at great cost to their environment. Their seas were sullied beyond hope of restoration, and disease soon overtook the increasingly dense population on land."
32,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_108","In pestilence they rotted, and in despair they became afraid. Records indicate that the surviving Grebuloffs came to hate their brethren by the end─both those who lived, and those who died. Organic life-forms are fickle indeed...but this unit's customers are pleasant enough."
33,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_109","<whirr> The third civilization─as designated by Meteion─is that of the Ea. What these life-forms called themselves prior to abandoning their physical forms for purely spiritual manifestation remains unknown even to them."
34,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_110","These customers were not replicated by Stigma-4, of course, but rather by Meteion herself. Thus, it is widely considered something of a miracle that management was able to drag them here at all."
35,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_111","Logs indicate that the Ea enjoy both gustatory stimulation and mental stimulation provided by the Last Dregs, as well as interacting with the Miw Miisv on Elysion. In any case, their patronage is a boon to our operational margins."
36,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_112","<whirr> The eighteenth civilization Meteion encountered was that of the Dragonstar. This unit believes you know the rest."

40,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_116","However, a life without sorrow was a life without joy─a meaningless existence for an organic life-form. Thus, in perfect ideological unity, they chose death for one and all."
41,"TEXT_REGUNI5LASTREMNANTBANOMIOMICRONWAITER_00803_M104_000_117","These patrons are exceedingly difficult to comprehend, let alone impart with hope, but the scans of Elysion speak for themselves. For our part, the Last Dregs' staff will continue offering warming beverages─one cup at a time."
