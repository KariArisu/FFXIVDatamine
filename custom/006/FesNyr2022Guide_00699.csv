13,"TEXT_FESNYR2022GUIDE_00699_TIGERSERVER_000_041","Heavensturn is a celebration that marks the start of a new year, though the way in which this day is observed differs from region to region. Here in Eorzea, it is said the Twelve select one among them to keep vigil over the realm until the next passing of the twelve moons. I believe this year it is Azeyma, the keeper of the sun and goddess of inquiry, who has been charged with this duty."
14,"TEXT_FESNYR2022GUIDE_00699_TIGERSERVER_000_042","In the Far East, however, the changing of the year is heralded by one of twelve totem animals. As you have no doubt discerned from my helm, this year we pay homage to the fearsome tora."

16,"TEXT_FESNYR2022GUIDE_00699_CUWSERVER_000_050","Advent cakes are a special kind of mochi, or rice cake, made specifically to celebrate Heavensturn. To be precise, they are made by pouring steaming bowls of rice into a mortar, near full to the brim, and then pounding the whole until it forms a thick white dough, which is then turned into advent cakes."
17,"TEXT_FESNYR2022GUIDE_00699_CUWSERVER_000_051","No doubt you shall have the chance to see some with your own eyes soon enough. The mochi daikan has been toiling of late in order to prepare plenty for the festival, and I am sure he has some to spare for you."
