23,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_200","The initial invasion of Bozja was led by Basch van Gabranth. There would be a change of commander not long after, however."
24,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_201","Thirty years ago, during the invasion of Dalmasca, his health took an unexpected turn for the worse, and his son, Noah van Gabranth, oversaw the conquest to its completion. He was a mere twenty years old when he assumed full command."
25,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_202","The IVth Imperial Legion itself is rather unique compared to most, for the bulk of their forces are not native Garleans, their present leader included."
26,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_203","Both Noah and his father were quite quick to bend the knee to Emperor Solus, from what I have been told. Perhaps it was that ardent loyalty that helped them rise to such prominence."
27,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_204","But not all were such fervent followers of the Empire. Quite the contrary, I would hazard the greater part of their soldiers were like us, seeing little recourse but to serve lest they be put to the sword."
28,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_205","Though I suppose the unwavering loyalty of the IVth Imperial Legion is what serves to set it apart from the rest. Or to be more precise, its loyalty to Noah van Gabranth."
29,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_206","What's more, you will come to find they are not wont to rely on magitek armaments like most imperial soldiers."
30,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_207","Indeed, they seem to prefer fighting the old-fashioned way, employing arcane magicks, techniques akin to summoning, and all manner of feral beasts rather than depending on heavy artillery."
31,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_208","But I fear these will be the least of our concerns, for the battalions en route to Bozja are said to be led by Lyon sas Helsos."
32,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_209","He is a strategist whose cunning is matched only by his renown as a tamer of beasts, and it is rumored that he alone is worth more than a thousand rank-and-file troops. One might say he has history with the Resistance."
33,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_215","If reports from our spies are to be believed, his lust for battle and reckless behavior have earned him a demotion to Lyon <Emphasis>rem</Emphasis> Helsos, meaning Menenius has likely taken his place as commanding officer. I fear this may only encourage the famed tamer of beasts to spend more time in the field, which may ultimately prove to our detriment. "

35,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_300","Ah yes, the leader of the IVth Imperial Legion, one of the youngest to ever take such a position. His father, Basch van Gabranth, served as legatus before him, claiming many a victory in the name of the Empire."
36,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_301","Basch was a knight of the Republic of Landis which, like so many other nations, was fast to fall at the hands of the Empire. Rather than die with dignity, he was quite quick to bend the knee to their conquerors, ingratiating himself with the Emperor and earning his place as a legatus."
37,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_302","This was quite a feat, given that he was not of Garlean blood. One can but imagine the lengths to which he went to earn their trust, but it is clear he labored hard to keep it."
38,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_303","His health took an unexpected turn for the worse during the invasion of Dalmasca, which afforded Noah the opportunity he needed to rise to prominence. And it was under Noah's leadership that Rabanastre would fall."
39,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_304","Then, when his father passed two years later, he was named the next legatus of the IVth Imperial Legion."
40,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_305","Many believe it was the conquest of Dalmasca that earned him the position, but some argue he was appointed on the recommendation of the Emperor, perhaps in recognition of his father's service to the Empire."
41,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_306","Regardless of the reason, Noah would continue in his father's footsteps. The IVth Imperial Legion would continue to be comprised primarily of foreign soldiers, and their loyalty to the newly appointed legatus was unfaltering."
42,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_307","One might expect such a legion to remain within the Emperor's good graces, but it would not be so when Varis took the throne. For several years he appointed them to the quelling of uprisings in remote provinces, as if to keep them at arm's length."
43,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_308","Perhaps he suspected an ulterior motive to the Gabranths seeking to gain such fervent adoration from the IVth Imperial Legion. I have no proof, of course, but one cannot help but wonder..."

46,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_402","The location was originally chosen for its natural defenses. Being surrounded on all sides by steep cliffs made Alermuc Fortress all but impregnable. Assuming, of course, one had the wherewithal to defend it."
47,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMARSCHAK_00658_MARSHAK_200_403","When the Garleans came, their magitek weaponry was unlike anything we had ever seen. A great many lives were lost in our struggle to hold the fortress, and in the end we were simply outmatched."
