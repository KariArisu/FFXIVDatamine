I would be lying if I said their appearance was not at all unnerving.

From what we can gather, they are a band of heretics who were exiled from Dalmasca prior to the Garleans' invasion. For a time, they were scattered across a number of countries, but eventually consolidated under the banner of the IVth Legion when Gabranth offered them asylum."

You see, they belonged to an obscure faction of the Priesthood of Saint Iocus that worshipped the High Seraph Ultima, in accordance with the Scriptures of Germonique. Their beliefs were deemed heresy, and so they were cast out."
