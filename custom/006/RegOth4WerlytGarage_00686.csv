1,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_001","In fact, I can take you down there for a closer look, if you're interested."
2,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_Q1_000_000","Inspect the G-Warrior?"
3,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_Q2_000_000","What will you do?"
4,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_A2_000_001","Ask about the G-Warrior."
5,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_A2_000_002","Inspect the G-Warrior's head."

9,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_A2_000_006","Stand by the G-Warrior."
10,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_A2_000_007","Return to Terncliff."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_010","When we first discovered it at Azys Lla, it was in a far worse state than it is now. Different color, too. As for its intended purpose, we believe it was developed to combat primals or similar threats."
12,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_011","All of the parts deemed unnecessary have been removed, and we've made several adjustments to improve stability and overall safety."
13,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_012","As a result, however, we had to limit its capabilities to some degree. We can't afford to repeat the mistakes made by the Garleans with the Ultima Weapon, who we believe employed knowledge obtained from the Ascians. After all, we know how that ended."
14,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_013","You might also be relieved to hear that Master Garlond has introduced a pilot recognition system, so that only those given prior permission by the Ironworks can operate it. Think of it as a precaution should the enemy get any ideas about stealing it from us."
15,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_020","The two sensors on the front of the head work in much the same way as the eyes of living creatures, sending visual information to the pilot."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_021","This hornlike protrusion was one of several additions we made ourselves. It's for picking up linkpearl signals, not for ramming the enemy. Still, if push comes to shove, I daresay it could be used to make a last-ditch attack."
17,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_030","Compared to the original design, the outward appearance is largely the same, but we've carried out a number of improvements."
18,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_031","The manipulators─or hands, you might call them─were originally created to claw at the enemy. We've modified them to allow the use of various weapons, such as the aetherial saber."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_040","Ah! I'm glad you noticed! The boosters were built entirely by the Ironworks to allow for low-altitude flight and increased maneuverability."
20,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGARAGE_00686_GARLONDMECHANIC00686_000_041","They're currently unsuited to being used over long distances, hence the need to have the G-Warrior transported by airship. This is another area we're hoping to improve in future iterations."
