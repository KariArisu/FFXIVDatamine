2,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_Q1_000_000","What will you do?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_A1_000_003","Ask about Eden."
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_A1_000_004","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_018","Information regarding the work being carried out in the Empty is treated with the utmost secrecy. To avoid it falling into the wrong hands, we limit the keeping of records and such to the bare minimum."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_019","Having said that, it does become rather difficult to keep track of the supplies that we deliver, so I have asked Ryne to provide reports on your activities."
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_020","The first such report will cover the time from your arrival in the Empty to your battle with Titan."
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_021","Though, truth be told, I cannot help feeling that this was rather a large burden to place on Ryne. No doubt she has enough on her plate as it is..."
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_022","Lewrey, I did what you asked!"
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_100_022","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Just the person I was hoping to see."
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_023","Oh, is that so? Well, before we go any further, please allow me to take receipt of the report."
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_024","And I hope you do not think it impertinent of me to ask, but what business might you have with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_025","Actually, I've brought something to show you."
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_026","Thancred and Urianger brought this back from Eden's core."
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_100_026","If you look closely, you can see images of your battles in the Empty."
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_027","Urianger seems to think they are Eden's memories, captured in crystal form. Would you like to see?"
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_SYSTEM_100_027","As you gaze into the crystal, visions of previous struggles race through your mind, with an intensity that far exceeds anything you have experienced."
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_028","What's wrong!?"
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_029","Different from how you remember it? How odd. What could cause Eden's memories to become so distorted?"
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_030","Well, we've been extracting and realigning enormous amounts of aether. Maybe that affected the crystal in some way?"

22,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_032","Even so, I expect that we can find a use for this extraordinary artifact."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_032","I think I have an idea. Although it shows images of things that never actually happened, studying them may help us to prepare for the challenges we'll face in the future."
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_033","Speaking of studying, Urianger's given me a few tomes to read through before our next expedition. I'd best get back to it, but I'll be seeing you again soon."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_200","Ryne informs me that balance has now been restored to all six elements in the Empty."
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_201","As such, representatives from the Crystarium will be making regular visits to the camp to observe any changes that occur. I shall oversee the delivery of whatever supplies they may require."
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_202","Once again, Ryne has kindly agreed to provide a report of your travails in the Empty, up to and including the encounter with the being known as Shiva. The preliminary verbal account left me gobsmacked to say the least!"
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_203","Lewrey! I've finally finished."
29,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_204","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, how goes it? Actually, there was something I wanted to ask you."
30,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_205","Don't worry, it's nothing dangerous! I was wondering if you'd like to join Gaia and I for some traditional Mord Souq <If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),12))><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),4))>evening<Else/>morning</If><Else/><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),17))>afternoon<Else/>evening</If></If> tea?"
31,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_206","And in the meantime, I can read through your report."
32,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_207","Now that's taken care of, let's head over to the tea stall!"
33,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_208","Before that, there's one more thing. This concerns you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
34,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_209","I found this in Eden's core, and it seemed like it could be important. For all I know, it might even help me get my memories back."
35,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_210","But when I look at it more closely, I see images of you swirling around inside it. Whatever this is, it probably means a lot more to you than it does to me."
36,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_211","This crystal contains Eden's memories. We've seen one of these before, haven't we?"
37,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_SYSTEM_000_212","As you stare intently at the crystal, your mind is overwhelmed with visions of struggles past, twisted and distorted by some unknown force."
38,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_100_212","Whatever is the matter?"
39,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_213","It's the same as last time... The only explanation I can think of is that Eden's own power altered its memories somehow. But was that before or after they were crystallized?"
40,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_214","What difference does it make? Regardless of how it was made and where it came from, I can't think of any possible use for this thing. If you want it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, it's yours."
41,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_215","<sigh> It looks like I was the one wasting time on this occasion. Let's go and try this tea I've heard so much about."
42,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_216","Gaia, wait a moment!"
43,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_217","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, you're still looking a bit green around the gills, so perhaps you can join us next time instead. Anyway, I'd best catch up with Gaia!"
44,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_218","Hmm... While this crystal may not serve as an accurate record of your battles, it provides a glimpse at what might have been. It could even help in mentally preparing yourself for foes you have yet to face."
45,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_219","Since it contains images of you and your exploits, it seems only right that you should be the one to safeguard it."
46,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_300","The final report? As a matter of fact, I'm rather curious to read it myself."
47,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_301","And while I have yet to actually receive it, I was pleased to hear that your latest venture has met with success."
48,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_302","Be that as it may, the readings did give me cause for concern. That was no ordinary aetherial disturbance, but I'm certain that all will be adequately explained by the report."
49,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_100_302","Unfortunately, Miss Ryne tells me there may be a slight delay. She will inform me once it is finished and they are ready to make the journey back here to Mord Souq. I shall contact you via linkpearl as soon as I hear from her."
50,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_SYSTEM_110_302","Some days later..."
51,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_303","(-???-)Here's the report, written by yours truly."
52,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_304","I think you'll find it quite a riveting read, if I do say so myself."
53,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_305","Oh, so you have taken over from Miss Ryne on this occasion?"
54,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_306","Well, I've recently become interested in writing and it seemed a good opportunity to practice. I thought giving an objective account of events would be straightforward, but it's surprisingly difficult. Reading it back, most of it sounds like gibberish."
55,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_307","There are also a few “creative liberties” in the parts that you couldn't quite remember."
56,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_308","In any case, I expect it will prove most valuable, providing I am able to discern fact from the...ah, embellishments."
57,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_309","With that taken care of, let's treat ourselves to some Mord snacks!"
58,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_310","Embellishments? I wonder..."
59,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_311","Oh, you're not still worried about that, are you? It was just you filling in the blanks, that's all!"
60,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_312","Here, take a look at this."
61,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_313","I found this after I recovered from the last battle."
62,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_314","It's another one of those crystals... The ones that contain Eden's memories."
63,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_SYSTEM_000_315","As you focus on the crystal, visions of vanquished adversaries sear your mind's eye, appearing to be far more puissant than your recollections."
64,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_316","Yes, I saw the images too. I'm glad the foes you actually fought weren't quite so ferocious."
65,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_317","Nevertheless, now that we know what Eden truly is, we owe it to Mitron to keep these memories alive, altered though they may be."
66,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_318","Gaia, are you sure about this?"
67,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_319","For all of that rage and malice...there was some good in there. And these memories were of you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, so I want you to have the crystal. Think of it as a parting gift from Mitron."
68,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_320","Anyway, what was that you were saying about snacks, Ryne? Maybe once we're done, I can take you for a ride. I've got transportation of my own now, you see."
69,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_321","What!? Whenever did you─? Oh, never mind... Sure, I'd love to go for a ride. And why don't we ask <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Lewrey to come along too?"
70,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_GAIA_000_322","I'm afraid there's only room for two. Maybe some other time?"
71,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_323","And there they go... Whatever Miss Gaia beheld in this crystal seems to have quite resonated with her. If you like, I will keep it here on your behalf. Whenever you wish to gaze into its depths again, you need only say the word."
72,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_400","That strange girl you met in the Empty is in our custody."

75,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_402","Fortunately, the majority of the tasks we perform─such as delivering supplies and equipment─tend to go unnoticed for the most part.

78,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_411","Unfortunately, no one in the neighboring area had any recollection of her. It seems she had very little in the way of meaningful contact with those outside of her immediate family."
79,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_412","Having said that, Eulmore has undergone a considerable upheaval of late, so perhaps with time, we may yet uncover some information regarding Gaia's past."

84,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_423","Though it may be some time before her memories return, we aim to make her stay as comfortable as possible. And who knows, she may even come to prefer it over Eulmore!"
85,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_430","Did you know that Miss Gaia has been asking about the skyslipper?"
86,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_431","At first, I thought she was purely interested in it as a means of avoiding any unnecessary exertion─walking, in other words. But I get the impression she enjoys riding it for its own sake."
87,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_432","Not that I am suggesting that your expeditions are some sort of recreational activity! Far from it! Still, one may as well enjoy oneself when given the opportunity."
