1,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RENRAKU_000_010","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! How might I be of service?"
2,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_Q1_000_000","What will you do?"
3,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_A1_000_003","Ask about Eden."
4,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_A1_000_004","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_018","Information regarding the work being carried out in the Empty is treated with the utmost secrecy. To avoid it falling into the wrong hands, we limit the keeping of records and such to the bare minimum."
6,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_019","Having said that, it does become rather difficult to keep track of the supplies that we deliver, so I have asked Ryne to provide reports on your activities."
7,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_020","The first such report will cover the time from your arrival in the Empty to your battle with Titan."
8,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_021","Though, truth be told, I cannot help feeling that this was rather a large burden to place on Ryne. No doubt she has enough on her plate as it is..."
9,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_022","Lewrey, I did what you asked!"
10,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_100_022","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Just the person I was hoping to see."
11,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_023","Oh, is that so? Well, before we go any further, please allow me to take receipt of the report."
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_024","And I hope you do not think it impertinent of me to ask, but what business might you have with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_025","Actually, I've brought something to show you."
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_026","Thancred and Urianger brought this back from Eden's core."
15,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_100_026","If you look closely, you can see images of your battles in the Empty."
16,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_027","Urianger seems to think they are Eden's memories, captured in crystal form. Would you like to see?"
17,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_SYSTEM_100_027","As you gaze into the crystal, visions of previous struggles race through your mind, with an intensity that far exceeds anything you have experienced."
18,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_028","What's wrong!?"
19,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_029","Different from how you remember it? How odd. What could cause Eden's memories to become so distorted?"
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_030","Well, we've been extracting and realigning enormous amounts of aether. Maybe that affected the crystal in some way?"
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_031",""
22,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_032","Even so, I expect that we can find a use for this extraordinary artifact."
23,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_032","I think I have an idea. Although it shows images of things that never actually happened, studying them may help us to prepare for the challenges we'll face in the future."
24,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_RYNE_000_033","Speaking of studying, Urianger's given me a few tomes to read through before our next expedition. I'd best get back to it, but I'll be seeing you again soon."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_400","That strange girl you met in the Empty is in our custody."
26,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_100_400","Her location is a closely guarded secret, and she is being monitored night and day for any changes in her condition."
27,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_401","We have also been treating any information regarding your mission as strictly confidential. It would cause quite a stir amongst the peoples of Norvrandt were it to become public knowledge, and we cannot afford for anyone to interfere with our work."
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN50LEWREY_00622_LEWREY_000_402","Fortunately, the majority of the tasks we perform─such as delivering supplies and equipment─tend to go unnoticed for the most part. In order to maintain this status quo, I and my colleagues will continue to lend our support in as discreet a manner as possible."
