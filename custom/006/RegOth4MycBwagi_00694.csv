1,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_001","Well, I don't understand what's going on here, but I don't intend on staying long enough after my work is through."
2,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_000_002","Though I suppose I can take a moment to talk, if there's something you need to know."
3,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_Q30_000_000","What will you say?"
4,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_A30_000_000","Tell me about the situation in Dalmasca."
5,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_A30_000_001","Tell me about yourself."

7,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_000","Dalmasca? That's precisely why I'm here. Lady Fran asked that I relay the news to Bajsaljen. What I have to say is meant only for his ears, but I suppose she wouldn't be cross if you were to hear as well. "
8,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_001","The resistance forces in Dalmasca and Nagxia have been planning assaults of their own to coincide with the Bozjan's strike on the castrum here."
9,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_002","In Dalmasca their target was Castrum Amicitia, known to most as the nigh-impenetrable Nalbina fortress. Their losses were great, but in the end their efforts were rewarded with victory."
10,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_003","In Nagxia they succeeded in taking a port to cut off their supply chain. The IVth Legion was surprisingly quick to turn tail from what I've been told."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_004","The forces in both Dalmasca and Nagxia are overjoyed by their success, but Lady Fran suspects something is amiss. She believes victory should not have been so easily won against the IVth Legion."
12,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_005","To that end, we have begun tracking their activity more closely. And considering the state of affairs in the Empire, we found it curious there has been little to or from their base of operations in Valnain."
13,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_006","After the death of Lord Varis, it would be an understatement to say the Empire fell into disarray. It's a war of factions in the truest sense of the word."
14,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_007","According to our intelligence, the IVth Legion has been ordered to return to the imperial capital, but Gabranth has refused. He's since proclaimed that Dalmasca will be the site of a new nation he intends to build."
15,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_008","Sounds to me like if he means to continue his fight for Bozja, the IVth Legion will be doing it alone."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_009","There may never be a more prime opportunity than now to defeat them. There's a growing call to strike, and I'm inclined to agree that we should. But Lady Fran insisted we wait until we better understood the IVth Legion's goal."
17,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_010","She had hoped the Bozjan's conflict with Gabranth's forces might shed some light on their motives, and it seems her suspicions were well founded."
18,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_011","Even so, that apparition, whatever it was, is certainly more than we were expecting. I hate to think what else he might have planned."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_100","Me? What's there to tell? A former fusilier to the royal family working with the Resistance against our common enemy─the IVth Legion."
20,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_101","For now, I serve as liaison for Lady Fran. I can already tell there will be much to speak of when I return to Dalmasca."
