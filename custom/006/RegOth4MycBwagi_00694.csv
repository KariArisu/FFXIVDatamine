18,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_001","The resistance forces in Dalmasca and Nagxia have been planning assaults of their own to coincide with the Bozjan's strike on the castrum here."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_002","In Dalmasca their target was Castrum Amicitia, known to most as the nigh-impenetrable Nalbina fortress. Their losses were great, but in the end their efforts were rewarded with victory."

23,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_006","After the death of Lord Varis, it would be an understatement to say the Empire fell into disarray. It's a war of factions in the truest sense of the word."
24,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_007","According to our intelligence, the IVth Legion has been ordered to return to the imperial capital, but Gabranth has refused. He's since proclaimed that Dalmasca will be the site of a new nation he intends to build."
25,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_008","Sounds to me like if he means to continue his fight for Bozja, the IVth Legion will be doing it alone."

27,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCBWAGI_00694_BWAGI_100_010","She had hoped the Bozjan's conflict with Gabranth's forces might shed some light on their motives, and it seems her suspicions were well founded."
