1,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_001","Not sure what help I can be to an accomplished hero such as yourself, but if you need anything─anything at all─don't hesitate to ask."

3,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_005","Please, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. You have to save Mikoto... Gods, I still can't understand why Misija would do this."
4,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_010","Thank goodness Mikoto was okay. No time to relax, though. Not as long as the IVth Legion is still out there up to no good."

6,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_015","Mikoto kept insisting on helping with my work around here, but I wouldn't hear of it. She has enough on her mind as it is helping contend with the imperials and Queen Gunnhildr."
7,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_016","As a matter of fact, I've been trying to take more work off her hands when I can. Anything to help you and Mikoto focus on the task at hand."
8,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_017","Speaking of which, is there anything you need?"
9,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_020","Mikoto said before that something about the summonings didn't sit right with her. Gods, I don't know what she's up to, but you have to find her!"
10,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_025","Thank the gods you're both all right. I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you two."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_026","If you need anything─anything at all─simply say the word."
12,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_030","I understand Mikoto's worried about Save the Queen─and rightfully so─but if anyone can stop Misija, it's you."
13,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_031","I'm sure you have things to do, battles to prepare for, but if you need anything, don't hesitate to ask."
14,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_035","So this is it, then? You and the others are off? I wish I could go with you, but goodness knows I'd only slow you down. Good luck, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
15,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_040","Hah, I knew it. Even with Save the Queen, Misija never stood a chance against you. <sniffle> Sorry. Something's in my eye."
16,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_041","Did you need something, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
17,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_045","Be careful when you get to Zadnor, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. With that fleet of ships looming overhead, it won't be just the troops on the ground you have to watch out for."
18,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_046","The outpost at Camp Vrdelnis is safe, at least, thanks to the chief. He can tell you more about it when you've arrived."
19,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_047","The barrier protecting this outpost should hold no problem, but I worry there won't be sufficient stores of energy at the next outpost, even if there is an aether current running under it."
20,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_048","Past surveys of the area have shown the currents can sometimes be severed in a way that prevents a proper flow of energy. But don't you worry, I'm already hard at work on a solution."
21,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_049","Speaking of which, I should be getting back to work. Unless, of course, there's something else you wanted to talk about?"
22,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_050","The defluxion aether manipulator is ready to go. It not only scans the area for flows of ambient aether, but reroutes them in whatever direction we need!"
23,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_051","If there's nothing else you wanted to talk about, I should give it one last check before it's sent out into the field. "
24,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_055","Thanks for setting up the D.A.M. for us. Erecting a barrier at the new outpost should prove no trouble at all. Assuming they secure a new outpost, that is."
25,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_056","Ahem. But enough about that, why don't we talk about something else. Like Mikoto's vision, perhaps...?
O-Or maybe something else."
26,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_057","Ah, right! Bajsaljen said he wanted to speak with you. About strategy or some such."
27,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_060","Why the furrowed brow? Was it something Bajsaljen said?"
28,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_061","...Maybe it's for the best if you didn't tell me. I should get back to work."
29,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_062","Unless...maybe there's something else you want to talk about?"
30,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_065","Setting up the new D.A.M.'s shouldn't be any different than the first one. If they seem a little unresponsive at first, a gentle tap should get them working. Or you could try opening the side panel and blowing out any dust or dirt that might have gotten inside."
31,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_066","I'll leave the rest to you, unless there's something else you need?"

33,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_069","That should do for now. Unless...there's something else you need?"
34,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_070","There you are! I've tried locating a current close to the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis>, but there's nothing in range of the spectrometer. If we're to have any chance of finding one, I'm going to need you to place a sensor out there."
35,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_071","Oh, and so you know, we've asked Bwagi to operate the D.A.M. once it's in place. With the fighting on the southern front dying down, he thought his time would be better spent helping us here."
36,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_072","I've marked an ideal spot on your map. When the sensor is set, contact me via linkpearl and I'll fire up the spectrometer."
37,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_073","If you have no questions, I'll leave you to it."

39,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_076","So you can be damn sure I'll do my part to keep everyone safe. I promise!"
40,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_080","Well, I guess we better get to work too, eh? As I mentioned earlier, we found a current close to their warship to set the D.A.M."
41,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_000_081","The location is right there, on your map. Trouble is, there are a few final adjustments that have to be made on-site, meaning I'll have to come along. You can handle any imperials that show up...right?"
42,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_Q30_000_000","What will you say?"
43,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_A30_000_000","Tell me about the aether spectrometer."
44,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_A30_000_001","Tell me about the recording drone."
45,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_A30_000_002","Tell me about yourself."

49,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_A40_000_001","Tell me about the defluxion aether manipulators."
50,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_A40_000_0010","Nothing."
51,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_000","The aether spectrometer? Well, seeing as I haven't read the manual, you'll have to settle for a brief explanation. Just promise not to tell Jessie, okay?"
52,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_001","Ahem. The idea for it originally came from Mikoto, and the chief─genius that he is─was able to put her ideas to paper. After that, all it took was a little ingenuity from our engineers to bring everything together."
53,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_002","After the sensors are in place and turned on, they analyze the aether currents running through the area, and that data is tracked by our monitors here."
54,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_003","What makes it so invaluable to our plans is its ability to distinguish between varying aetherial signatures. The large aether currents we're tracking are like giant rivers fed by streams of different kinds of aether. But with the spectrometer, we can easily pick out the specific one we need. Fascinating stuff, isn't it?"
55,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_100","The what? Oh, right. The chief picked it up on one of his scavenging trips to Allagan ruins somewhere. It's been surprisingly nice to have around. Goodness knows I can't keep track of everything going on here."
56,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_101","Jessie asked that I keep it on at all times. Between you and me, though, I think she just wants to keep a close eye on me. Whether that's a good or a bad thing, I'm not sure."
57,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_200","M-Me!? But I... Why would you want to know about me?"
58,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_201","Can't imagine we have many common interests. I'd make for terrible company, what with you being the savior of Eorzea, while I'm just a... Oh gods..."
59,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_SYSTEM_100_202","As Lilja's face begins to turn red, her speech becomes increasingly incoherent. You think it best to leave her be."
60,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_300","The chief came up with the idea after the Dalmascan resistance consulted him on ideas to protect their outposts. In ancient times, certain cities and strongholds there were protected by magicked barriers said to reach up to the heavens."
61,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_301","I'm told the mages performed rather complicated rites to do it, but it basically boiled down to enchanting crystals with protection spells."
62,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_302","Of course, the greater the area covered, the more crystals they required. What's more, in a case such as ours, a veritable army of mages chanting incantations around the clock would be required."
63,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_303","The Dalmascan resistance thought magitek might be able to replicate the effect, and so they called on the chief to hopefully work something out."
64,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_304","The first thing that came to mind was Seiryu's Wall in the Burn: a device that could erect a barrier over a given space using the ambient aether flowing in the ground beneath it."
65,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_305","It was agreed that Bozja had the more pressing need, and so the chief brought his new shielding technology here first. It's on a much smaller scale than Seiryu's Wall, mind, but it certainly does the job."
66,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_306","When building them in Dalmasca, I do hope he remembers that not every land has been suffused with unnaturally high stores of energy like Bozja. Though I shouldn't be worried. This is the chief we're talking about, after all."
67,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_307","At any rate, that's why we have a barrier protecting Camp Vrdelnis."
68,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_308","At any rate, that's why we have a barrier protecting Camp Vrdelnis and Zuprtik Point."
69,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_309","At any rate, that's why we have barriers protecting all the outposts out here."
70,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_400","Gosh, it's so exciting seeing one of my inventions put to such good use. It certainly wasn't easy coming up with something to handle such delicate work while also tough enough to survive on the battlefield."
71,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_401","It's a wonder we didn't need them when we first came to the southern front. You'd be surprised at how many aether currents are either too small to be of use, or too fragmented to carry a steady stream of aether."
72,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_402","That's where the defluxion aether manipulators come in!"
73,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCLILJA_00693_LILJA_100_403","There's nothing more motivating than praise from the chief. I can't wait for another chance to show off my engineering know-how."
