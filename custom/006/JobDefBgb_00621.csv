2,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_001_000","So, you've been dabbling in other disciplines, have you? It's always good to have more than one trick up your sleeve. That's something I've come to understand from seeing the adventurers passing through here."
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_002_000","So, you've been dabbling in other disciplines, have you? It's always good to have more than one trick up your sleeve. But for people like Rostik and myself, we prefer to stick to what we know."

11,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_000_013","To tell the truth, this is the first time since fleeing the Empire that we've found any semblance of peace. We both learned a lot from traveling around Eorzea, but this is the only place we've really felt at home."

13,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_000_111","I must admit that it was a great relief to discover that I was not the last of my kind, nor the last Bozjan gunbreaker. It also means that I need not be in such a hurry to find successors to inherit our techniques."

19,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_000_122","As a matter of fact, you were not the only acquaintance of mine to join this collective of renowned warriors. My countryman, Rostik, was able to overcome his hatred for the Empire and lend his considerable strength to aiding its people. Perhaps you had occasion to speak with him?"
20,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_000_123","In any case, now that the capital has fallen, it remains to be seen what will become of the formerly occupied territories.

26,"TEXT_JOBDEFBGB_00621_RADOVAN_000_025","Seeing that we stood little chance of victory against these guns, the queen's guard rushed headlong through the enemy lines for the sole purpose of destroying them. Thus did these brave heroes come to be called “gunbreakers.”"
