5,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_100","Ever since ye showed me that crystal, me hunger for craftin' has been damn near insatiable."
6,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_101","In fact, I've been spendin' so much time in here, I think I might be breathin' me own breath... I s'pose that's the danger o' livin' an' workin' in a forge beneath the sea."
7,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_102","Maybe I should think about buildin' meself a little house someplace. All this constant hammerin' <Emphasis>has</Emphasis> brought in a fair share o' coin, after all."
8,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_110","Ever since ye came traipsin' through here, I've been reminded o' how bleedin' lonely it can get down here. Even sent a letter to the Crystarium."
9,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_111","I trained there in me youth, if ye can believe it. Made the damn near finest kettles Norvrandt had ever seen. <sigh> Good times, they were... Would that I could live 'em again."
10,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_112","Hmmm. Maybe I can. Not as a student, but a teacher. Aye, I could build a workshop, take a few younglings under me wing. Somethin' to think about, eh?"
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_120","Well, I've been travelin' back an' forth between me workbench here an' the Crystarium. Seems when it comes to me regular work, I prefer to hammer away in a place what's set up just how I like it."
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_121","But I tell ye, there's no beatin' the world above for fresh ideas. That little project with Miss Chora-Zoi is as much for me benefit as it is for hers─I can already feel the seeds of inspiration takin' root."
13,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_122","An' the more time I spend in the Crystarium, the more chance there is o' Mistress Mowen payin' me a visit... Uh, I mean “us”! The workshop in town, that is! Purely for professional reasons!"
14,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_130","Workin' so far away from me dear Mowen tugs at the ol' heart strings, aye, but life goes on. I reckon that's why I prefer the Crystarium over me underwater hovel these days─can't expect any visits from me beloved when I'm surrounded by sea slugs."
15,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_131","But ye heard the vows. Ours is a marriage born out o' love an' a mutual respect for our life's work. We'll keep on improvin', no matter the distance between us. Each time I gaze at me kettle, I know Mowen's thinkin' the very same."
16,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_132","Come to think of it, Miss Chora-Zoi once said she walked the smitty's path because o' me kettles. The fates have made it a symbol of hope for us all, it seems... Perhaps one day they'll inspire the whole bleedin' realm, just like our splendorous tools."
17,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_300","That shell of a crystal ye carry about... It tells a hero's tale. A tragic saga o' hope an' loss."
18,"TEXT_REGNOR4GRENOLDT_00628_GRENOLDT_000_301","In me attempt to capture that achin' majesty in armor, I've poured me all into cloth, an' leather, an' metal─a “journey's end” for the memories what remain. An' if I'm ever struck by that same lightning, I reckon I can do it again."
