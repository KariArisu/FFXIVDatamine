1,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_100_000","Someone's dressed different from usual. What's the occasion...?"
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_200_000","Welcome to the Wandering Stairs, love... I take it by that look in your eye, you're thinking about him too, aren't you?"
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_201_000","Though I labor to fathom the how or the why of it, I think it best we not speak of it further. Not where others may hear, at least."
4,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_300_000","Welcome to the Wandering─ Oh, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>...
Have you given any thought to Ardbert's resurrection?"
5,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_301_000","Part of me wishes to believe it is him, that fate has seen fit to return him to the living. But you and I both know it could never be so simple."
6,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_Q1_000_050","What will you ask?"
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_051","How fare you of late?"
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_052","Tell me about the Shadowkeeper."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_053","Tell me about the Warriors of Light."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_054","Nothing."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_060","Still tending the bar, cleaning up after drunkards and Glynard. If this is the punishment you had in mind, I struggle to fathom a harsher fate!"
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_061","In all seriousness, I have been making an effort to use my spare moments to entertain patrons with stories of the Warriors of Light. The truth, with all the forgotten glories and sordid details."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_062","This being a bar, most of the folks lending an ear are a few drinks deep, so there's no telling how much of it they retain, or believe for that matter. But I'll keep at it. Stories have a way of spreading."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_063","In all seriousness, I have been making an effort to use my spare moments to entertain patrons with stories of the Warriors of Light, but it seems a certain someone has stolen a good deal of my thunder."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_064","Judging by the ramblings of our patrons─drunken though they may be─the people have been taking your words to heart. That said, Ardbert's miraculous return to the land of the living still concerns me. I'd be careful around him if I were you. He seems changed somehow...and I cannot say if it's for the better."
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_070","Why, only the greatest villain of her day. The mysterious architect of countless tragedies all across Norvrandt who finally faced justice at the hands of the Warriors of Light. The betrayer whose defeat set in motion events culminating with the Flood of Light. But you knew that much, didn't you?"
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_071","Before I took that name, I was known by another in the Thirteenth, a shard all but subsumed by Darkness. There I met with Ascians who convinced me that the only path to salvation was to embrace the Dark and journey unto this world."
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_072","I had two objectives. One was to raise up heroes brave and true, worthy champions of the Light─Ardbert and the others. I would join them in their journey and shepherd them unto glory."
19,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_073","Heroes need enemies to grow stronger, and so I sowed the seeds of discord. From Lakeland to Kholusia, from Amh Araeng to Il Mheg, I set in motion events that would forever change the lives of my comrades and countless others."
20,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_074","My second objective was contingent on the first. I would confront the adventurers forged by hardship into Warriors of Light and strike them down at the height of their power, ensuring that the delicate imbalance between the primordial forces would be preserved just so. But in the end, I failed."
21,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_080","Ardbert, Lamitt, Branden, Renda-Rae, Nyelbert. These are the names of the villains responsible for the Flood of Light which nearly destroyed our world."
22,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_081","Lies and slander, of course. They were as much victims of fate as any of us."
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_082","They traveled the length and breadth of Norvrandt, helping those in need, and for their deeds came to be known as heroes. But sometimes all it takes to destroy your reputation is a bad turn."
24,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_083","And yet, despite everything that happened, they refused to give up. They cut a deal with the man in white and made one last desperate gamble. But you know that tale better than me, don't you?"
