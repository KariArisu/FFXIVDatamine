1,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_100_000","Someone's dressed different from usual. What's the occasion...?"
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_200_000","Welcome to the Wandering Stairs, love... I take it by that look in your eye, you're thinking about him too, aren't you?"
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_201_000","Though I labor to fathom the how or the why of it, I think it best we not speak of it further. Not where others may hear, at least."
4,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_300_000","Welcome to the Wandering─ Oh, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>...
Have you given any thought to Ardbert's resurrection?"
5,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_301_000","Part of me wishes to believe it is him, that fate has seen fit to return him to the living. But you and I both know it could never be so simple."
6,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_310_000","So, you've done what needed doing. Uncovered the truth of Ardbert's resurrection and duly dealt with the mastermind."
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_311_000","Our friend may now have the ending he deserves. Thank you."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_312_000","With this, we finally reach the conclusion of the tale I tell. But your own continues, and it's for you to fill the pages as you will."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_315_000","I'll keep their crystals safe, along with their stories. You have my word on that."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_SYSTEM_316_000","The quest “The Hero's Journey” is now available. "
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_SYSTEM_317_000","In order to accept it, you must have completed the Chronicles of a New Era quests “Thok Around the Clock,” “The Diabolical Bismarck,” “A Fiendish Likeness,” “A Deific Simulacrum,” and “A Demonic Duplicate.”"
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_320_000","At loose ends, are you? You're welcome to loiter about here─if you intend to spend some coin while you're at it."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_321_000","Not that I'm not grateful for the business you've brought in, mind. The hunters are here even more often now that they're working together, and their accounts never go unsettled for long."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_322_000","They're a pain in the arse to serve, of course. Maybe I'll drop your name next time I need them to behave."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_323_000","Still, it's nice to feel like something grand is in motion again. Perhaps Ardbert rubbed off on me more than I anticipated..."
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_Q1_000_050","What will you say?"
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_051","How fare you of late?"
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_052","Tell me about the Shadowkeeper."
19,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_053","Tell me about the Warriors of Light."
20,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_055","Tell me about Eden."
21,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_056","Tell me about Unukalhai."
22,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_057","I went to the Thirteenth."
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_A1_000_054","Nothing."
24,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_060","Still tending the bar, cleaning up after drunkards and Glynard. If this is the punishment you had in mind, I struggle to fathom a harsher fate!"
25,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_061","In all seriousness, I have been making an effort to use my spare moments to entertain patrons with stories of the Warriors of Light. The truth, with all the forgotten glories and sordid details."
26,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_062","This being a bar, most of the folks lending an ear are a few drinks deep, so there's no telling how much of it they retain, or believe for that matter. But I'll keep at it. Stories have a way of spreading."
27,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_063","In all seriousness, I have been making an effort to use my spare moments to entertain patrons with stories of the Warriors of Light, but it seems a certain someone has stolen a good deal of my thunder."
28,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_064","Judging by the ramblings of our patrons─drunken though they may be─the people have been taking your words to heart. That said, Ardbert's miraculous return to the land of the living still concerns me. I'd be careful around him if I were you. He seems changed somehow...and I cannot say if it's for the better."
29,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_065","In all seriousness, I continue to use my spare moments to entertain patrons with stories of the Warriors of Light. And thanks to your recent exploits, it's never been easier to find willing ears."
30,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_066","What's more, with no more impostor walking about deceiving the masses, I'm now free to share the tale in its entirely─to speak the unadulterated truth. It seems I'll remain in my calling as a tavern wench for a while yet."
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_070","Why, only the greatest villain of her day. The mysterious architect of countless tragedies all across Norvrandt who finally faced justice at the hands of the Warriors of Light. The betrayer whose defeat set in motion events culminating with the Flood of Light. But you knew that much, didn't you?"
32,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_071","Before I took that name, I was known by another in the Thirteenth, a shard all but subsumed by Darkness. There I met with Ascians who convinced me that the only path to salvation was to embrace the Dark and journey unto this world."
33,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_072","I had two objectives. One was to raise up heroes brave and true, worthy champions of the Light─Ardbert and the others. I would join them in their journey and shepherd them unto glory."
34,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_073","Heroes need enemies to grow stronger, and so I sowed the seeds of discord. From Lakeland to Kholusia, from Amh Araeng to Il Mheg, I set in motion events that would forever change the lives of my comrades and countless others."
35,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_074","My second objective was contingent on the first. I would confront the adventurers forged by hardship into Warriors of Light and strike them down at the height of their power, ensuring that the delicate imbalance between the primordial forces would be preserved just so. But in the end, I failed."
36,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_080","Ardbert, Lamitt, Branden, Renda-Rae, Nyelbert. These are the names of the villains responsible for the Flood of Light which nearly destroyed our world."
37,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_081","Lies and slander, of course. They were as much victims of fate as any of us."
38,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_082","They traveled the length and breadth of Norvrandt, helping those in need, and for their deeds came to be known as heroes. But sometimes all it takes to destroy your reputation is a bad turn."
39,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_083","And yet, despite everything that happened, they refused to give up. They cut a deal with the man in white and made one last desperate gamble. But you know that tale better than me, don't you?"
40,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_090","Eden? And what should I know about that?"
41,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_091","Mitron? You're quite certain? "
42,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_092","And a girl bearing Loghrif's soul... I thought I sensed something oddly umbral about the Crystarium of late."
43,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_093","Ardbert meant to put an end to the whole business, but truth be told, I wouldn't mind retreading old memories a bit. It might be nice to share a pint with the girl─once she's of age, of course. As a matter of fact..."
44,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_094","Do you think this “Gaia” would make a good waitress? No? Damn..."
45,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_100","As I mentioned, we never met in our previous lives. Or should I say “while we were properly alive”? ...This never gets less confusing."
46,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_101","In any case, we each fought to protect the Thirteenth, but alone as we were, I can hardly say that I know the details of his efforts...only the regrets that we shared after."
47,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_102","It wasn't too long before we went our separate ways to play our separate parts, yet here we are again. One last chance to walk the noble path together? Who can say."
48,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_110","What? Not only did you travel to the Thirteenth, you encountered a memoriate besides!? Wicked white, that's nothing short of a miracle..."
49,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_111","I used to be a memoriate myself, but I lost my powers when the Ascians plucked me out of the void. It's astounding to think that this Zero managed to survive with hers all this time."
50,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_112","Though she claims to have no desire to save our world, as a compatriot, I should still be keen to meet her. There's only so many of us left, after all─those who haven't completely lost themselves."
51,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_113","Also, I know full well that you and yours have your own objective in the Thirteenth. But should you discover aught that might lead to its restoration, I'd thank you to share it with me."
