2,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGUIDE_00685_A1_000_001","Can you tell me about yourself?"

5,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGUIDE_00685_REGRETOLDMAN00685_000_001","Me? Not much to tell, and even less worth knowing. These days, I go about my daily business trying not to bother anyone. Just another sad old man, all alone and dying of...well, I doubt you'd care even if I told you."

8,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGUIDE_00685_REGRETOLDMAN00685_000_004","Being far to the south of Werlyt, perched atop the cliffs, there was never much reason for anyone to travel here. Being by the sea is all well and good, but we're simply too high above the water to benefit much from it. The gulls and terns don't seem to mind, though."

Once the invasion was complete, the imperials started digging down into the rock and built a supply depot for their blasted airships. But the experiments were a more recent development."
11,"TEXT_REGOTH4WERLYTGUIDE_00685_REGRETOLDMAN00685_000_007","Of course, none of us civilians were privy to what it was they were working on. I expect that'll all come to light now that the bastards have all turned and fled with their tails between their legs. We've got you and yours to thank for that, even if it is only a temporary respite."

But from what I hear, it was a group of orphans raised by a Garlean legatus who played a vital role in winning our independence. Alfonse, I think their leader was called..."
