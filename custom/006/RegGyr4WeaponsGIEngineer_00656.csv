1,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_COMP","Of late, all I can think about is Weapons, Weapons, Weapons. I channel this passion into crafting homages of my favorite warmachina, which is more than a mere hobby! It is the wind in my sails!"
2,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_Q1_000_001","Which of my creations would you like to see?"
3,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_MENU_CANCEL","None of them."
4,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_NOSELECT_000","Ah. Well, that is not quite the level of enthusiasm I was hoping for. But I am not one to be so easily deterred! Should you have a change of heart, I am ever ready to display my masterworks!"
5,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_000","Alas, I am lacking fresh inspiration, and I fear that without the necessary stimulation, my tools will be left to gather dust..."
6,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_001","The Ruby Weapon? A fine choice! Please, allow me a moment to prepare."
7,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_002","Feast your eyes on the likeness of the Crimson Conqueror, the Vermilion Villain, the Scarlet...Scoundrel, the one and only Ruby Weapon!"
8,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_003","As I am sure you remember, its most prominent characteristics were its impregnable armor plating, adroitly depicted here, and its long, flexible claws, which are...well, you'll just have to imagine those for now."
9,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_004","The head and arched neck are somewhat reminiscent of a ravenous voidsent, which may be the result of having absorbed a primal, possibly even one summoned by those resisting the Empire. In that sense, it could even be considered an ally of sorts!"
10,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_005","Ah, there I go, getting carried away as usual!"
11,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_006","I can tell you've absorbed about as much information as you can handle for now, so why don't we fire up the Real Virtuality Combat Simulation Experiencinator?"
12,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_100_006","You'd best brace yourself, because even I don't know what's going to happen!"
13,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_010","Why, yes! Of course! Just a moment, please..."
14,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_100_010","Oof! Gods be good, this thing weighs a tonze! Perhaps I should've used lighter materials..."
15,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_200_010","So, what do you think? Is it every bit as terrifying as the foe you faced? Behold the Malevolent Malachite Marauder, the Vicious Viridian Villain, the Jumentous Jade Giant! (...Actually, perhaps not that last one.) Anyway, it's the Emerrraaald Weeeaaapon!"
16,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_011","I assure you, I spared no expense in making it as true to life, so to speak, as possible!"
17,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_012","The information we received regarding its design revealed several startling details. Perhaps most surprising of all were the free-floating manipulators─or hands, if you prefer─which allowed it to attack from multiple angles simultaneously!"
18,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_013","We even learned that their positioning was based on tactics used by Gaius himself when he led the imperial invasion of Werlyt. By surrounding the target, they are able to bombard it from all sides while keeping it pinned down."
19,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_014","Not only that, but the Emerald Weapon was able to perfectly replicate Gaius's renowned Terminus Est gunblade technique, though on a much larger scale. I wish I could've been there to see it for myself! Oooh... You're so lucky!"
20,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_015","Haha, goodness me, all this talking has made me rather parched."
21,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_016","But before I pour myself a nice glass of local arak, I think it's time for us to fire up the Real Virtuality Combat Simulation Experiencinator, to see what wonders it can conjure."
22,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_017","<Emphasis>Anything</Emphasis> could happen, so don't say I didn't warn you!"
23,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_020","An excellent choice. I'll have it ready in a jiffy!"
24,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_021","Here it is! The most formidable of all Weapons, one that requires no introduction. Having said that, I'll give one regardless!"
25,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_022","Let me begin with its alternate name, AEW-I-Z. Like the other models, it is an “Anti-Eikon Warmachina” and the “I” is a numeral indicating that it belongs to the first series of prototypes. “Z” seems to imply that it's the final version."
26,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_023","This is merely conjecture on my part, but the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald Weapons appear to have been designed from the outset to gather data for making improvements to the Diamond Weapon."
27,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_024","But that's not all. The Diamond Weapon was equipped with a certain...element that the other models lacked. This enabled it to reach its final, perfected state. But it's the nature of this element that troubles me..."
28,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_025","Even after reading the reports, I'm still having trouble coming to terms with the sacrifices made in the name of the Weapon project. Perhaps we should give a moment of silence for the young lives lost..."
29,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_026","...I was planning to give this sculpture to the people of Werlyt, as a reminder of the brave souls whose deeds eventually led to independence from the Empire."
30,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_027","As with my previous works, the sculpture can also be used to reenact your encounter with the Weapon. I hope it will prove useful in preparing for whatever the future holds in store."
31,"TEXT_REGGYR4WEAPONSGIENGINEER_00656_SYSTEM_000_900","The totems earned in the Sorrow of Werlyt can be exchanged for gear and other items by speaking with C'intana in Revenant's Toll."
