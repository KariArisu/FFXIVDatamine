1,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_Q1_000_001","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_A1_000_001","What is the Starlight Celebration?"
3,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_A1_000_002","What's your task in all this?"
4,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_GUIDEXMS2020_000_010","The Starlight Celebration can be traced back to ancient Ishgard. Long ago, a terrible battle claimed countless lives, leaving thousands of children orphaned in the harsh cold weather of Coerthas."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_GUIDEXMS2020_000_011","Unable to bear their suffering, Ishgardian knights would offer these children board and lodging within their barracks. Of course, this was expressly forbidden, but the knights devised a plan to sneak them in, disguising the children in jackets of their scarlet uniforms."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_GUIDEXMS2020_000_012","Owing to their generosity, the children survived the winter and lived to pay forward the kindness they had received. The former orphans would adorn themselves in scarlet uniforms, delivering gifts to children on the coldest week of the year. Thus, the Starlight Celebration was born."
8,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_GUIDEXMS2020_000_013","Over the years, the celebration has undergone gradual changes. The snowy-bearded captain of the kind-hearted knights has become known as the “Saint of Nymeia,” and children believe that he delivers their hopes and prayers directly to the goddess Herself."
9,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_GUIDEXMS2020_000_014","Similarly, his red-jacketed knights have become the “saint's little helpers.” They are particularly beloved by the younglings, for it is their role to bring gifts to every child who sends a prayer to the Spinner."
10,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_GUIDEXMS2020_000_020","My scarlet-clad colleagues and I have been charged by the Adventurers' Guild with running the Starlight Celebration. The festival spans the entire realm of Eorzea, and we have little helpers stationed in the cities of Gridania, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah."
11,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_GUIDEXMS2020_000_021","This year, I fear we're running rather behind schedule—to the point that we've had to seek the aid of the very children who would otherwise be lying in their beds waiting for the saint to arrive. Fortunately, they seem just as happy to help prepare for the festivities as to partake in them!"
12,"TEXT_FESXMS2020GUIDE_00697_GUIDEXMS2020_000_022","No doubt this is in part due to the lovely assortment of seasonal presents we've prepared in our twinklebox! Needless to say, if you're willing to lend us a hand, you're more than happy to help yourself to a special gift as well. Happy Starlight, friend, and may the Spinner's blessing be with you!"
