42,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_200","Scant though they are, the records we have uncovered thus far suggest the practices of seers date back as far as the Fourth Astral Era."
43,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_201","The region was plagued with all manner of natural disasters in those days, inciting great unrest not only amongst the Bozjans, but neighboring nations as well."
44,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_202","It was during these tumultuous times seers first appeared. In fact, I have reason to believe they possessed the Echo."
45,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_203","Using a crystal focus, they were able to delve into the minds of the downcast and the heartsick, seeking out their darkest memories and altering them to ease the peoples' burdens."
46,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_204","Perhaps they saw the altering of minds as a necessity for their survival, but we must consider the ethical implications of such methods in this day and age. I have no doubt my betters in Sharlayan would consider it to be reprehensible."
47,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_300","My initial analysis of the crystals suggests they are man-made. Nothing in my data can prove the materials are unique to this region, which leads me to believe the Bozjans─or rather, the seers─created them."
48,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_301","However, given the intricate lattices found in these crystals, it seems highly improbable that the Bozjans could have produced them, considering the methods available to them in the Fourth Astral Era."
49,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_302","In fact, on closer inspection, it became clear that its structure is quite similar to that found in Allagan constructs."
50,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_303","Which then begs the question: who were the seers, and whence did they come? This is but a working theory, but I suspect their roots can be traced back to the Allagans themselves─perhaps survivors of the Fourth Umbral Calamity who wished to atone for the sins of their forebears."
51,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_304","They came to these lands seeking a means to help the Bozjans, and in doing so created these crystal foci."
52,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_305","...Ahem. As I said, 'tis but a working theory. Though I understand if it sounds more like a flight of fancy."
53,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_400","Perhaps I should start with a simple explanation, as I did before. Let us consider the composition of a person's aether, shall we? There is corporeal aether of the flesh, incorporeal aether of the soul, and the aetherial residue of an individual's memories."
54,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_401","Were one to be possessed of only corporeal aether, they would be but a walking corpse. Conversely, entities comprised of only incorporeal aether are referred to in layman's terms as ghosts. Of course, a ghost that possesses residual memories could likely recall its past and retain self-awareness."
55,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_402","Using a crystal focus, we can isolate the aetherial signature of memories, much in the same way the seers did. We can then delve into and explore specific memories conjured by the subject."
56,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_403","We must be careful of what we observe, however, for while the information stored in a person's memories can be quite comprehensive, it is not always true to fact. They can be distorted due to the passage of time, or even when first committed to the mind as a result of personal bias."
57,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_404","That is why it is important to mark the distinction between explicit and implicit memories."
58,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_405","Explicit memories are those consciously stored and recalled, while implicit memories are more passively accumulated by our subconscious."
59,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_406","When meeting someone for the first time, their appearance will be kept as part of our explicit memory, though this may fade with the passing of time. Should a great deal of time pass without meeting, however, such recollection can prove difficult."
60,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_407","Yet in that moment, your mind also takes record of everything experienced by your sensory nervous system."
61,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_408","Unfortunately, information called from explicit memory is quite sensitive to misrepresentations of events. After all, if an individual is actively choosing to recall an event, who is to say they will not make alterations to better suit their liking?"
62,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_409","That is why we seek information from implicit memory, which is more likely to be preserved free of the bias of an individual's worldview."
63,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_500","The Echo can manifest itself in myriad ways dependent on the individual. I was gifted with the ability to peer into the future."
64,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_501","It is a power much like prophetic dreams and divinations, and yet quite different, for such visions only tell of the future's potential."
65,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_502","The Echo does not show me what may happen, but what <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> happen."
66,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_503","Scholars speculate Mezaya Thousand Eyes too shared this gift, hence the alarming accuracy of the passages writ in her <Emphasis>Divine Chronicles</Emphasis>."
67,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_504","These visions are a decidedly rare occurrence, usually containing some crucial insight into matters presently unfolding before me. For better or worse, I have never had visions of an impending threat on my life or those around me."
68,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_505","Not that I would want to see such things, of course. Could you imagine, knowing of certain doom that cannot be avoided?"
69,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_506","I once spoke of my visions to an acquaintance─a relatively harmless glimpse of the future─and it resulted in a terrible argument. I fear I could not bear the weight of grimmer tidings..."

71,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_520","Legend has it that, when the Fourth Umbral Calamity threatened to destroy all of Bozja, Queen Gunnhildr used the power of her holy blade, Save the Queen, to save her people."
72,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_521","Misija called it a primal summoning, claiming the queen was able to control its power much like Lady Ysayle harnessed the power of Shiva."
73,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_522","The apparition we saw in the memory assumed the form of what I presume was Queen Gunnhildr, the entity Misija summoned adopting the same appearance."
74,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_523","As to why it would take such a form, I believe it is linked to the nature of Queen Gunnhildr's death at the hands of her guard."
75,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_524","This is but a theory, mind you, but if the residual aether of her memories was absorbed by the blade, it stands to reason Save the Queen could gain some semblance of sentience."
76,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_525","Curious that Misija was somehow able to control it. I can only assume this was made possible through our shared use of the crystal focus. "
77,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_526","But theories will do little to help us defeat this new threat. A great deal more research must be done if we are to understand and overcome the IVth Legion's schemes."
78,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_530","A feat that seems increasingly implausible the more I consider it. Hmmm..."
79,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_535","A pity it was destroyed, though I suppose it is for the best. We are ill-suited to using it as the seers of eld did, and now the spirit of Queen Gunnhildr can never again be manipulated for nefarious ends."
80,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_536","Even so, as long as Save the Queen exists, there remains the risk of its power being abused."
81,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_537","But I wonder... Do you suppose the aether which comprised the queen's memories still reside in the blade? Without the crystal focus, perhaps we will never know."
82,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_540","I believe the term was coined after confrontations with the primal Ifrit. The creature would bombard its enemies with a veritable deluge of aether, rendering them mindless slaves."
83,"TEXT_REGOTH4MYCMIKOTO_00659_MIKOTO_300_541","Though perhaps it would be more accurate to say their will is supplanted by that of the primal. They will act instinctively according to its whims and desires, no matter how depraved or immoral."
