I am the ushi doshin, a member of a Far Eastern delegation come to share our traditions of Heavensturn with the good people of Eorzea. If there is aught you would know of this year's celebration, you need only ask."

4,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_A1_000_3","What is mochi pounding?"
5,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_A1_000_4","Nothing."
6,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_001","At the turning of the year, a small delegation journeys to Eorzea to herald the coming of Heavensturn. In sharing our traditions, we aim to strengthen the bonds of friendship between Eorzea and the Far East."
7,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_002","To mark the occasion, our leader, the ushi bugyo, put forward a most interesting idea─distribute advent cakes to the people of Limsa Lominsa. Please do try some. They are quite delicious."
8,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_010","Why, we are here to celebrate Heavensturn, of course! And thanks to your timely assistance, we shall do so without fear of assault by sentient mochi."
9,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_011","We shall have need of a great deal more advent cake, of course, and should we encounter those mochi monstrosities again, your aid would be most welcome!"

12,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_040","You are unfamiliar with this festival? The tradition has a rich history which dates back centuries, but I do not wish to bore you, so I shall try and keep my summation brief."
13,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_041","Heavensturn is a celebration that marks the start of a new year, though the way in which this day is observed differs from region to region. Here in Eorzea, it is said the Twelve select one among them to keep vigil over the realm until the next passing of the twelve moons. I believe this year it is Oschon, the Wanderer, who has been charged with this duty."
14,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_042","In the Far East, however, the changing of the year is heralded by one of twelve totem animals. As you have no doubt discerned from my helm, this year we pay homage to the mighty ushi."
15,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_043","Ah, forgive me. That name is likely unfamiliar to your ears. I believe you Eorzeans call this most majestic of beasts an ox. How such a peculiar name was conceived I will never know."
16,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_050","It is how we create our advent cakes, the staple sweet of Heavensturn in the Far East. We first prepare a sizable portion of steamed rice and place it in a mortar, where it is then pounded into the thick, sticky paste we call mochi."
17,"TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_051","Though you may find it hard to believe, the pounding of the rice in and of itself is something of a spectacle─this year in particular. You see, the officials here in Limsa Lominsa have graciously offered to have the rice pounded by a Gozu, a gargantuan brute whose visage resembles the great ushi."
