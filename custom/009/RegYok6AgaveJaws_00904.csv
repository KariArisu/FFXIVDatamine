9,"TEXT_REGYOK6AGAVEJAWS_00904_SOVLI_000_011","Nothing pleases me more than when someone takes an interest in the farm! My colleagues and I spend all day looking after the agaves─I suppose it just feels nice when our hard work is appreciated."
10,"TEXT_REGYOK6AGAVEJAWS_00904_SOVLI_000_020","Why, it's an agave farm of course! We collect their sap and distill it to make mezcal."
11,"TEXT_REGYOK6AGAVEJAWS_00904_SOVLI_000_021","As for the farm's namesake, well, just look at how neatly we have the plants lined up! Doesn't the view remind you of a wild beast's gaping maw? Er, not that I've seen one up close..."
