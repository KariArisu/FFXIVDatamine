1,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_002","How goes the hunt, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? If you're here to try your hand against the local fauna, I might be able to tell you a thing or two about them."
2,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
3,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_A1_000_001","Tell me about the rank B elite mark. (Gallowsbeak)"

9,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_010","If you should come across an axe beak feeding its nestlings, you might think them kind and doting parents, sharing the day's spoils with their young just like any of us might."
10,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_011","But take a closer look at what's dangling from their jaws, and it paints a very different picture. They take their prey by the head, you see, and swing them by the neck till the last breath leaves them."
11,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_012","The biggest ones with the hungriest chicks aren't satisfied with a single victim, oh no. They'll take half a dozen or more, all by the heads, and race back to their nests looking to all the world like a portable gallows after a roundup. Hence the name─and hence why we want these things dead."
12,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_020","You've seen an aerostat, right? The floating weapons platform? Well, the gargant is an advanced experimental model, intended to clear particularly pernicious vilekin nests with napalm bombs."
13,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_021","Unfortunately for us, the experiment went wrong. Seems at some point it took a direct lightning strike to its identification circuitry, and ever since, it's targeted anything with a pulse for elimination."
14,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_022","It took a whole cohort of the Alexandrian army to drive it away into the wilds, where it's since occupied itself burning everything in its path to cinders. If it were ever to make a return, even our regulators might not be enough to save us."
15,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_030","The name means “child of thunder” in the Shetona tongue, and the creatures are true to it: they're literally born from lightning. We always have to be careful when a bolt falls nearby, lest it should conjure up one of these fiends."
16,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_031","Back when they'd just finished building Yyupye's Halo, lightning struck one of the watering towers and brought one with it. A lot of folk who'd gathered for the grand unveiling lost their lives. This was before most Turali had made their peace with the regulators, so there was no bringing them back."
17,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_032","Would that you could say the same for the heshuala, but no─so long as the lightning keeps falling, they keep spawning. And so it falls to hunters like us to keep their numbers as close to zero as we can."
18,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_040","When Zoraal Ja became king, he ordered that all of Alexandria's weapons programs be massively accelerated. The engineers were under a lot of pressure and they made plenty of mistakes along the way. Urna Variabilis was one of them."
19,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_041","It was designed as a tactical unit to counter fast-moving forces: using a gravitational field to immobilize them, and a lightning beam to make sure they stayed that way. Unfortunately, it had one fatal flaw: its energy consumption was so high that it could only function in lands where the air was saturated with levin."
20,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_042","So the engineers switched their attentions to a different design─one that had a hope of working outside of Alexandria, as Zoraal Ja demanded. Problem is, in their rush, they forgot to turn the old experiment off. And so it continues its patrol, turning its ire on anyone or anything fleet-footed enough to be judged a legitimate target."
21,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_050","You know how Zoraal Ja introduced the idea of using feral souls in the regulators, so their wearers could gain the strength of powerful beasts? Well, it didn't just happen overnight. It took a lot of experimentation."
22,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_051","They needed to establish how the potency of the feral soul being assimilated translated into the empowerment of the subject, particularly at levels that invoked a physical transformation. It was this question that Atticus, a knight of the Alexandrian army, volunteered to answer."
23,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_052","The plan was to imbue him with souls until his flesh fully transformed─at which point they'd subject him to a barrage of tests to determine his newfound strength. As it turned out, no tests were needed─for when he awakened, he immediately tore a hole in the side of the holding facility and fled into the wilds."
24,"TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_053","Naturally, this was all hushed up. It's only very recently that the details have started to trickle out─one of which being Atticus's apparently insatiable appetite for meat. Perhaps cooking up a big batch of barbecue might be enough to tempt him out from hiding?"
