1,"TEXT_REGYOK6CRACKEDCISTERN_00908_BOLILYIK_000_001","So, I hear we have a new Dawnservant now. Dawnservants, even. I wonder if the outcasts and offcuts of Tural have any place in their plans. Folk like us."

9,"TEXT_REGYOK6CRACKEDCISTERN_00908_BOLILYIK_000_021","Whoever came up with the name must have had a sense of humor about the whole thing. We're the damaged goods from the kilns of Earthenshire. The busted flushes."
10,"TEXT_REGYOK6CRACKEDCISTERN_00908_BOLILYIK_000_022","That's not to say we've broken off with the Moblins entirely, though. Some of them still keep us in materials, and we give them our creations in return, but it's all very hugger-mugger and arm's-length. No direct contact─which, to be honest, suits us just fine."
