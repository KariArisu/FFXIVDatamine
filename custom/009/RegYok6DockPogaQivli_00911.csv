1,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_Q1_000_000","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_A1_000_001","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_A1_000_002","What kind of place is this?"
4,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_100_100","I'm Qivli, the Turali Travel Agency's head clerk. Under young Liplu's ever-steady supervision, I ensure our accommodation facilities meet the agency's high standards."
6,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_000_101","I used to work at the alpaca wool bedding emporium Liplu and Yubli ran together. I started the job back when their mother still managed the business."
7,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_000_102","When they began to sense tourism's potential, the siblings handed the shop back to the family and plunged their pel into the new venture. A fair few of us from the bedding emporium followed them. Sometimes it's hard to keep up with their incredible drive, but I wouldn't have it any other way!"
8,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_000_103","My goal is to make sure visitors have an unforgettable stay. Guided tours are all well and good, but without comfy beds and sumptuous guest rooms, the business model is only half complete!"
9,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_000_200","This is Dock Poga, home of the Turali Travel Agency's Kozama'uka branch. In case you didn't know, “Poga” means “fruit” in the Hanuhanu tongue."
10,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_000_201","After the great storm laid waste to the area, Liplu negotiated with Elder Zanuhali and received her blessing to develop the site."
11,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_000_202","Seeing the place now, it's difficult to imagine the storm ever tearing through here. Wuk Evu and his team of laborers did an impeccable job."
12,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_100_202","With the guide training facility up and running, it's hard not to feel hopeful about our prospects. As for me, I'll keep the alpaca wool bedding pristine and the pillows plumped, and see to it our guests sleep soundly!"
13,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_200_202","And now our base of operations has grown again to accommodate our newly airborne staff members. Honestly, I never thought I'd see the day punutiys fly─and certainly not laden with tourists bound for upriver Kozama'uka! I'm still not entirely sure whether the idea was a stroke of genius or moment of madness..."
14,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_200_203","Nonetheless, by partnering with the beastkeepers to guarantee the creatures receive the care they need, our workload has hardly changed. My faith in Liplu's managerial skills is undiminished!"
15,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_300_202","I must say, the new eatery looks splendid. Though I had my reservations about Liplu's plans to track down that former bandit─even with you accompanying her! Still, the restaurant is proving quite the hit. I suppose it was a risk worth taking after all..."
16,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_300_203","It's been a pleasure to see Wawkesa and his old crew take to their duties with such professionalism. They'll be a vital asset for us moving forward. "
17,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_400_202","Now that we have official backing from the Wing of Reflection, I daresay Dock Poga will continue to flourish. Anyway, I want to thank you for being there to support young Liplu. We all owe you a great deal!"
18,"TEXT_REGYOK6DOCKPOGAQIVLI_00911_QIVLI_400_203","In many ways, the Turali Travel Agency's journey is just beginning. I hope you continue to tread the path with us, wherever it may lead."
